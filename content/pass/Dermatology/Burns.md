The following is based on guidance issued by Clinical Knowledge Summaries (please see the link for more details).  
  
Immediate first aid  
* airway, breathing, circulation
* burns caused by heat: remove the person from the source. Within 20 minutes of the injury irrigate the burn with cool (not iced) water for between 10 and 30 minutes. Cover the burn using cling film, layered, rather than wrapped around a limb
* electrical burns: switch off power supply, remove the person from the source
* chemical burns: brush any powder off then irrigate with water. Attempts to neutralise the chemical are not recommended

  
Assessing the **extent** of the burn  
* Wallace's Rule of Nines: head \+ neck \= 9%, each arm \= 9%, each anterior part of leg \= 9%, each posterior part of leg \= 9%, anterior chest \= 9%, posterior chest \= 9%, anterior abdomen \= 9%, posterior abdomen \= 9%
* Lund and Browder chart: the most accurate method
* the palmar surface is roughly equivalent to 1% of total body surface area (TBSA). Not accurate for burns \> 15% TBSA

  
Assessing the **depth** of the burn  
  


| **Modern terminology** | **Former terminology** | **Appearance** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Superficial epidermal | First degree | Red and painful, dry, no blisters |
| Partial thickness (superficial dermal) | Second degree | Pale pink, painful, blistered. Slow capillary refill |
| Partial thickness (deep dermal) | Second degree | Typically white but may have patches of non\-blanching erythema. Reduced sensation, painful to deep pressure |
| Full thickness | Third degree | White ('waxy')/brown ('leathery')/black in colour, no blisters, no pain |

  
Referral to secondary care  
* all deep dermal and full\-thickness burns.
* superficial dermal burns of more than 3% TBSA in adults, or more than 2% TBSA in children
* superficial dermal burns involving the face, hands, feet, perineum, genitalia, or any flexure, or circumferential burns of the limbs, torso, or neck
* any inhalation injury
* any electrical or chemical burn injury
* suspicion of non\-accidental injury

  
Initial management of burns  
* initial first aid as above
* review referral criteria to ensure can be managed in primary care
* superficial epidermal: symptomatic relief \- analgesia, emollients etc
* superficial dermal: cleanse wound, leave blister intact, non\-adherent dressing, avoid topical creams, review in 24 hours

  
Pathophysiology of severe burns
-------------------------------

  
Following the burn, there is a local response with progressive tissue loss and release of inflammatory cytokines. Systemically, there are cardiovascular effects resulting from fluid loss and sequestration of fluid into the third space. There is a marked catabolic response. Immunosupression is common with large burns and bacterial translocation from the gut lumen is a recognised event. Sepsis is a common cause of death following major burns.   
  
Management of more severe burns
-------------------------------

  
The initial aim is to stop the burning process and resuscitate the patient.   
  
The airway should be assessed first as with any emergency  
* smoke inhalation can result in airway oedema
* early intubation should be considered e.g. if deep burns to the face or neck, blisters or oedema of the oropharynx, stridor etc

  
Intravenous fluids will be required for children with burns greater than 10% of total body surface area. Adults with burns greater than 15% of total body surface area will also require IV fluids. The fluids are calculated using the Parkland formula which is; volume of fluid\= total body surface area of the burn % x weight (Kg) x4\. Half of the fluid is administered in the first 8 hours.   
  
A urinary catheter should be inserted. Analgesia should be given. Complex burns, burns involving the hand perineum and face and burns \>10% in adults and \>5% in children should be transferred to a burns unit.   
  
Circumferential burns affecting a limb or severe torso burns impeding respiration may require escharotomy to divide the burnt tissue.   
  
Conservative management is appropriate for superficial burns and mixed superficial burns that will heal in 2 weeks. More complex burns may require excision and skin grafting. Excision and primary closure is not generally practised as there is a high risk of infection.   
  
There is no evidence to support the use of anti microbial prophylaxis or topical antibiotics in burn patients.   
  
Escharotomies  
* Indicated in circumferential full thickness burns to the torso or limbs.
* Careful division of the encasing band of burn tissue will potentially improve ventilation (if the burn involves the torso), or relieve compartment syndrome and oedema (where a limb is involved)
