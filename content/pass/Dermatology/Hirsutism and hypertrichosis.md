Assessment of hirsutism  
* Ferriman\-Gallwey scoring system: 9 body areas are assigned a score of 0 \- 4, a score \> 15 is considered to indicate moderate or severe hirsutism

  
Management of hirsutism  
* advise weight loss if overweight
* cosmetic techniques such as waxing/bleaching \- not available on the NHS
* consider using combined oral contraceptive pills such as co\-cyprindiol (Dianette) or ethinylestradiol and drospirenone (Yasmin). Co\-cyprindiol should not be used long\-term due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism
* facial hirsutism: topical eflornithine \- contraindicated in pregnancy and breast\-feeding
