**Extensive burns**  
* Haemolysis due to damage of erythrocytes by heat and microangiopathy
* Loss of capillary membrane integrity causing plasma leakage into interstitial space
* Extravasation of fluids from the burn site causing hypovolaemic shock (up to 48h after injury)\- decreased blood volume and increased haematocrit
* Protein loss
* Secondary infection e.g. *Staphylococcus aureus*
* ARDS
* Risk of Curlings ulcer (acute peptic stress ulcers)
* Danger of full thickness circumferential burns in an extremity as these may develop compartment syndrome

  
**Healing**  
* Superficial burns: keratinocytes migrate to form a new layer over the burn site
* Full thickness burns: dermal scarring. Usually need keratinocytes from skin grafts to provide optimal coverage.
