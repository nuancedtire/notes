Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, non\-infectious, inflammatory disorder. It is an uncommon cause of very painful skin ulceration. It may affect any part of the skin, but the lower legs are the most common site.   
  
Pathophysiology  
* pyoderma gangrenosum is classified as a neutrophilic dermatosis
* neutrophilic dermatoses are skin conditions characterised by dense infiltration of neutrophils in the affected tissue and this is often seen on biopsy

  
Causes  
* idiopathic in 50%
* inflammatory bowel disease in 10\-15%
	+ ulcerative colitis
	+ Crohn's
* rheumatological
	+ rheumatoid arthritis
	+ SLE
* haematological
	+ myeloproliferative disorders
	+ lymphoma
	+ myeloid leukaemias
	+ monoclonal gammopathy (IgA)
* granulomatosis with polyangiitis
* primary biliary cirrhosis

  
Features  
* location
	+ typically on the lower limb
	+ soften at the site of a minor injury as in this patient's case and this is known as pathergy
* initially features:
	+ usually starts quite suddenly
	+ small pustule, red bump or blood\-blister
* later features:
	+ the skin then breaks down resulting in an ulcer which is often painful
	+ the edge of the ulcer is often described as purple, violaceous and undermined.
	+ the ulcer itself may be deep and necrotic
* may be accompanied by systemic symptoms
	+ fever
	+ myalgia

Diagnosis  
* often made by the characteristic appearance, associations with other diseases, the presence of pathergy, histology results and when other diseases have been ruled out
* histology is not specific and can vary depending on the time and site of the specimen but may be helpful in ruling out other causes of an ulcer.

  
Management  
* the potential for rapid progression is high in most patients and most doctors advocate oral steroids as first\-line treatment
* other immunosuppressive therapy, for example, ciclosporin and infliximab, have a role in difficult cases
* any surgery should be postponed until the disease process is controlled on immunosuppression to risk worsening of the disease (pathergy)
