Alopecia areata is a presumed autoimmune condition causing localised, well demarcated patches of hair loss. At the edge of the hair loss, there may be small, broken 'exclamation mark' hairs  
  
Hair will regrow in 50% of patients by 1 year, and in 80\-90% eventually. Careful explanation is therefore sufficient in many patients. Other treatment options include:  
* topical or intralesional corticosteroids
* topical minoxidil
* phototherapy
* dithranol
* contact immunotherapy
* wigs
