The differential diagnosis of shin lesions includes the following conditions:  
* erythema nodosum
* pretibial myxoedema
* pyoderma gangrenosum
* necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum

  
Below are the characteristic features:  
  
Erythema nodosum  
* symmetrical, erythematous, tender, nodules which heal without scarring
* most common causes are streptococcal infections, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease and drugs (penicillins, sulphonamides, oral contraceptive pill)

  
Pretibial myxoedema  
* symmetrical, erythematous lesions seen in Graves' disease
* shiny, orange peel skin

  
Pyoderma gangrenosum  
* initially small red papule
* later deep, red, necrotic ulcers with a violaceous border
* idiopathic in 50%, may also be seen in inflammatory bowel disease, connective tissue disorders and myeloproliferative disorders

  
Necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum  
* shiny, painless areas of yellow/red skin typically on the shin of diabetics
* often associated with telangiectasia
