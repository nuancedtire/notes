NICE released guidelines in 2012 on the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthropathy. Please see the link for more details.  
  
Chronic plaque psoriasis management
-----------------------------------

  
NICE recommend a step\-wise approach for chronic plaque psoriasis  
* regular emollients may help to reduce scale loss and reduce pruritus
* first\-line: NICE recommend:
	+ a potent corticosteroid applied once daily plus vitamin D analogue applied once daily
	+ should be applied separately, one in the morning and the other in the evening)
	+ for up to 4 weeks as initial treatment
* second\-line: if no improvement after 8 weeks then offer:
	+ a vitamin D analogue twice daily
* third\-line: if no improvement after 8\-12 weeks then offer either:
	+ a potent corticosteroid applied twice daily for up to 4 weeks, or
	+ a coal tar preparation applied once or twice daily
* short\-acting dithranol can also be used

### Secondary care management

  
Phototherapy  
* narrowband ultraviolet B light is now the treatment of choice. If possible this should be given 3 times a week
* photochemotherapy is also used \- psoralen \+ ultraviolet A light (PUVA)
* adverse effects: skin ageing, squamous cell cancer (not melanoma)

  
Systemic therapy  
* oral methotrexate is used first\-line. It is particularly useful if there is associated joint disease
* ciclosporin
* systemic retinoids
* biological agents: infliximab, etanercept and adalimumab
* ustekinumab (IL\-12 and IL\-23 blocker) is showing promise in early trials

  
Scalp psoriasis management
--------------------------

  
Outline  
* NICE recommend the use of potent topical corticosteroids used once daily for 4 weeks
* if no improvement after 4 weeks then either use a different formulation of the potent corticosteroid (for example, a shampoo or mousse) and/or a topical agents to remove adherent scale (for example, agents containing salicylic acid, emollients and oils) before application of the potent corticosteroid

  
Face, flexural and genital psoriasis management
-----------------------------------------------

  
Outline  
* NICE recommend offering a mild or moderate potency corticosteroid applied once or twice daily for a maximum of 2 weeks

  
Notes on medication
-------------------

  
Using topical steroids in psoriasis  
* as we know topical corticosteroid therapy may lead to skin atrophy, striae and rebound symptoms
	+ the scalp, face and flexures are particularly prone to steroid atrophy so topical steroids should not be used for more than 1\-2 weeks/month
* systemic side\-effects may be seen when potent corticosteroids are used on large areas e.g. \> 10% of the body surface area
* NICE recommend that we aim for a 4\-week break before starting another course of topical corticosteroids
* they also recommend using potent corticosteroids for no longer than 8 weeks at a time and very potent corticosteroids for no longer than 4 weeks at a time

  
Vitamin D analogues  
* examples of vitamin D analogues include calcipotriol (Dovonex), calcitriol and tacalcitol
* they work by ↓ cell division and differentiation → ↓ epidermal proliferation
* adverse effects are uncommon
* unlike corticosteroids they may be used long\-term
* unlike coal tar and dithranol they do not smell or stain
* they tend to reduce the scale and thickness of plaques but not the erythema
* they should be avoided in pregnancy
* the maximum weekly amount for adults is 100g

A 'before and after' image showing the effect of 6 weeks of calcipotriol therapy on a large plaque. Note how the scale has improved but the erythema remains  
Dithranol  
* inhibits DNA synthesis
* wash off after 30 mins
* adverse effects include burning, staining

  
Coal tar  
* mechanism of action not fully understood \- probably inhibit DNA synthesis
