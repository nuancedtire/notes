Fungal nail infection (onychomycosis) may involve any part of the nail, or the entire nail unit. Toenails are significantly more likely to become infected than fingernails  
  
Causative organisms  
* dermatophytes
	+ account for around 90% of cases
	+ mainly *Trichophyton rubrum*
* yeasts
	+ account for around 5\-10% of cases
	+ e.g. *Candida*
* non\-dermatophyte moulds

  
Risk factors  
* increasing age
* diabetes mellitus
* psoriasis
* repeated nail trauma

  
Features  
* 'unsightly' nails are a common reason for presentation
* thickened, rough, opaque nails are the most common finding

Differential diagnosis  
* psoriasis
* repeated trauma
* lichen planus
* yellow nail syndrome

  
Investigation  
* nail clippings \+/\- scrapings of the affected nail
	+ microscopy and culture
	+ should be done for all patients if antifungal treatment is being considered
	+ the false\-negative rate for cultures are around 30%, so repeat samples may need to be sent if the clinical suspicion is high

  
Management  
* do not need to be treated if it is asymptomatic and the patient is not bothered by the appearance
* if dermatophyte or *Candida* infection is confirmed
	+ if limited involvement (≤50% nail affected, ≤ 2 nails affected, more superficial white onychomycosis): topical treatment with amorolfine 5% nail lacquer; 6 months for fingernails and 9 \- 12 months for toenails
	+ if more extensive involvement due to a dermatophyte infection: oral terbinafine is currently recommended first\-line; 6 weeks \- 3 months therapy is needed for fingernail infections whilst toenails should be treated for 3 \- 6 months
	+ if more extensive involvement due to a *Candida* infection: oral itraconazole is recommended first\-line; 'pulsed' weekly therapy is recommended
