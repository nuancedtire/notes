* predominant erythema/flushing [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/rosacea/management/rosacea/#:~:text=If%20there%20is%20persistent%20erythema%2C%20consider%20prescribing%20topical%20brimonidine%200.5%25%20gel "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - Acne rosacea guidelines")
	+ topical brimonidine gel may be considered for patients with predominant flushing but limited telangiectasia
	+ brimonidine is a topical alpha\-adrenergic agonist
	+ this can be used on an 'as required basis' to temporarily reduce redness
	+ it typically reduces redness within 30 minutes, reaching peak action at 3\-6 hours, after which the redness returns to the baseline
* mild\-to\-moderate papules and/or pustules [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/rosacea/management/rosacea/#:~:text=If%20there%20are%20mild%2Dto%2Dmoderate%20papules%20and/or%20pustules%2C%20prescribe%20topical%20ivermectin "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - Acne rosacea guidelines")
	+ topical ivermectin is first\-line
	+ alternatives include: topical metronidazole or topical azelaic acid
* moderate\-to\-severe papules and/or pustules [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/rosacea/management/rosacea/#:~:text=moderate%2Dto%2Dsevere%20papules%20and/or%20pustules%2C%C2%A0prescribe%20a%20combination%20of%20topical%20ivermectin%2C%20depending%20on%20local%20prescribing%20guidelines%2C%20together%20with%20oral%20doxycycline "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - Acne rosacea guidelines")
