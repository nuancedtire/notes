Venous ulceration is typically seen above the medial malleolus  
  
Investigations  
* ankle\-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is important in non\-healing ulcers to assess for poor arterial flow which could impair healing
* a 'normal' ABPI may be regarded as between 0\.9 \- 1\.2\. Values below 0\.9 indicate arterial disease. Interestingly, values above 1\.3 may also indicate arterial disease, in the form of false\-negative results secondary to arterial calcification (e.g. In diabetics)

  
Management  
* compression bandaging, usually four layer (only treatment shown to be of real benefit)
* oral pentoxifylline, a peripheral vasodilator, improves healing rate
* small evidence base supporting use of flavinoids
* little evidence to suggest benefit from hydrocolloid dressings, topical growth factors, ultrasound therapy and intermittent pneumatic compression
