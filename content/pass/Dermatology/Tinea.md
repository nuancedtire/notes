Tinea is a term given to dermatophyte fungal infections. Three main types of infection are described depending on what part of the body is infected  
* tinea capitis \- scalp
* tinea corporis \- trunk, legs or arms
* tinea pedis \- feet

  
Tinea capitis (scalp ringworm)  
* a cause of scarring alopecia mainly seen in children
* if untreated a raised, pustular, spongy/boggy mass called a kerion may form
* most common cause is *Trichophyton tonsurans* in the UK and the USA
* may also be caused by *Microsporum canis* acquired from cats or dogs
* diagnosis: lesions due to *Microsporum canis* green fluorescence under Wood's lamp\*. However the most useful investigation is scalp scrapings
* management (based on CKS guidelines): oral antifungals: terbinafine for *Trichophyton tonsurans* infections and griseofulvin for *Microsporum* infections. Topical ketoconazole shampoo should be given for the first two weeks to reduce transmission

Tinea corporis (ringworm)

Tinea pedis (athlete's foot)  
* characterised by itchy, peeling skin between the toes
* common in adolescence

  
\*lesions due to *Trichophyton* species do not readily fluoresce under Wood's lamp
