Scabies is caused by the mite *Sarcoptes scabiei* and is spread by prolonged skin contact. It typically affects children and young adults.   
  
The scabies mite burrows into the skin, laying its eggs in the stratum corneum. The intense pruritus associated with scabies is due to a delayed\-type IV hypersensitivity reaction to mites/eggs which occurs about 30 days after the initial infection.  
  
Features  
* widespread pruritus
* linear burrows on the side of fingers, interdigital webs and flexor aspects of the wrist
* in infants, the face and scalp may also be affected
* secondary features are seen due to scratching: excoriation, infection

Management  
* permethrin 5% is first\-line
* malathion 0\.5% is second\-line
* give appropriate guidance on use (see below)
* pruritus persists for up to 4\-6 weeks post eradication

  
Patient guidance on treatment (from Clinical Knowledge Summaries)  
* avoid close physical contact with others until treatment is complete
* all household and close physical contacts should be treated at the same time, even if asymptomatic
* launder, iron or tumble dry clothing, bedding, towels, etc., on the first day of treatment to kill off mites.

  
The BNF advises to apply the insecticide to all areas, including the face and scalp, contrary to the manufacturer's recommendation. Patients should be given the following instructions:  
* apply the insecticide cream or liquid to cool, dry skin
* pay close attention to areas between fingers and toes, under nails, armpit area, creases of the skin such as at the wrist and elbow
* allow to dry and leave on the skin for 8\-12 hours for permethrin, or for 24 hours for malathion, before washing off
* reapply if insecticide is removed during the treatment period, e.g. If wash hands, change nappy, etc
* repeat treatment 7 days later

The crusted skin will be teeming with hundreds of thousands of organisms.   
  
Ivermectin is the treatment of choice and isolation is essential
