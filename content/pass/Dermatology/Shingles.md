Shingles (herpes zoster infection) is an acute, unilateral, painful blistering rash caused by reactivation of the varicella\-zoster virus (VZV). Following primary infection with VZV (chickenpox), the virus lies dormant in the dorsal root or cranial nerve ganglia.  
  
Risk factors  
* increasing age
* HIV: strong risk factor, 15 times more common
* other immunosuppressive conditions (e.g. steroids, chemotherapy)

  
The most commonly affected dermatomes are T1\-L2\.  
  
Features  
* prodromal period
	+ burning pain over the affected dermatome for 2\-3 days
	+ pain may be severe and interfere with sleep
	+ around 20% of patients will experience fever, headache, lethargy
* rash
	+ initially erythematous, macular rash over the affected dermatome
	+ quickly becomes vesicular
	+ characteristically is well demarcated by the dermatome and does not cross the midline. However, some 'bleeding' into adjacent areas may be seen

The diagnosis is usually clinical.  
  
Management  
* remind patients they are potentially infectious
	+ may need to avoid pregnant women and the immunosuppressed
	+ should be advised that they are infectious until the vesicles have crusted over, usually 5\-7 days following onset
	+ covering lesions reduces the risk
* analgesia
	+ paracetamol and NSAIDs are first\-line
	+ if not responding then use of neuropathic agents (e.g. amitriptyline) can be considered
	+ oral corticosteroids may be considered in the first 2 weeks in immunocompetent adults with localized shingles if the pain is severe and not responding to the above treatments
* antivirals
	+ NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries makes recommendations on when to use antivirals
	+ in practice, they recommend antivirals within 72 hours for the majority of patients, unless the patient is \< 50 years and has a 'mild' truncal rash associated with mild pain and no underlying risk factors
	+ one of the benefits of prescribing antivirals is a reduced incidence of post\-herpetic neuralgia, particularly in older people
	+ aciclovir, famciclovir, or valaciclovir are recommended

  
Complications  
* post\-herpetic neuralgia
	+ the most common complications
	+ more common in older patients
	+ affects between 5%\-30% of patients depending on age
	+ most commonly resolves with 6 months but may last longer
* herpes zoster ophthalmicus (shingles affecting affecting the ocular division of the trigeminal nerve) is associated with a variety of ocular complications
* herpes zoster oticus (Ramsay Hunt syndrome): may result in ear lesions and facial paralysis
