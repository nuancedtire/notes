There are four main subtypes of melanoma. Nodular melanoma is the most aggressive whilst the other forms spread more slowly.   
  


|  | Superficial spreading | Nodular | Lentigo maligna | Acral lentiginous |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Frequency** | 70% of cases | Second commonest | Less common | Rare form |
| **Typically affects** | Arms, legs, back and chest, young people | Sun exposed skin, middle\-aged people | Chronically sun\-exposed skin, older people | Nails, palms or soles, People with darker skin pigmentation |
| **Appearance** | A growing moles with diagnostic features listed above | Red or black lump or lump which bleeds or oozes | A growing mole with diagnostic features listed above | Subungual pigmentation (Hutchinson's sign) or on palms or feet |

   
  
There are other rare forms of melanoma including desmoplastic melanoma, amelanotic melanoma, or melanoma arising in other parts of the body such as ocular melanoma.  
  


| **The main diagnostic features (major criteria):*** Change in size * Change in shape * Change in colour | **Secondary features (minor criteria)*** Diameter \>\= 7mm * Inflammation * Oozing or bleeding * Altered sensation |

**Treatment**  
* Suspicious lesions should undergo excision biopsy. The lesion should be removed in completely as incision biopsy can make subsequent histopathological assessment difficult.
* Once the diagnosis is confirmed the pathology report should be reviewed to determine whether further re\-excision of margins is required (see below):

  
**Margins of excision\-Related to Breslow thickness**  


| **Lesions 0\-1mm thick** | 1cm |
| --- | --- |
| **Lesions 1\-2mm thick** | 1\- 2cm (Depending upon site and pathological features) |
| **Lesions 2\-4mm thick** | 2\-3 cm (Depending upon site and pathological features) |
| **Lesions \>4 mm thick** | 3cm |

  
Further treatments such as sentinel lymph node mapping, isolated limb perfusion and block dissection of regional lymph node groups should be selectively applied.
