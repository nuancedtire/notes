Keloid scars are tumour\-like lesions that arise from the connective tissue of a scar and extend beyond the dimensions of the original wound  
  
Predisposing factors  
* ethnicity: more common in people with dark skin
* occur more commonly in young adults, rare in the elderly
* common sites (in order of decreasing frequency): sternum, shoulder, neck, face, extensor surface of limbs, trunk

  
Keloid scars are less likely if incisions are made along relaxed skin tension lines\*  
  
Treatment  
* early keloids may be treated with intra\-lesional steroids e.g. triamcinolone
* excision is sometimes required but careful consideration needs to given to the potential to create further keloid scarring

\*Langer lines were historically used to determine the optimal incision line. They were based on procedures done on cadavers but have been shown to produce worse cosmetic results than when following skin tension lines
