Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune condition causing sub\-epidermal blistering of the skin. This is secondary to the development of antibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins BP180 and BP230\.  
  
Bullous pemphigoid is more common in elderly patients. Features include  
* itchy, tense blisters typically around flexures
* the blisters usually heal without scarring
* there is stereotypically no mucosal involvement (i.e. the mouth is spared)
	+ in reality around 10\-50% of patients have a degree of mucosal involvement. It would, however, be unusual for an exam question to mention mucosal involvement as it is seen as a classic differentiating feature between pemphigoid and pemphigus.

Skin biopsy  
* immunofluorescence shows IgG and C3 at the dermoepidermal junction

  
Management  
* referral to a dermatologist for biopsy and confirmation of diagnosis
* oral corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment
* topical corticosteroids, immunosuppressants and antibiotics are also used
