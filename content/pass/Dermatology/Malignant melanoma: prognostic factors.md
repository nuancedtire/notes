The invasion depth of a tumour (Breslow depth) is the single most important factor in determining prognosis of patients with malignant melanoma  
  


| **Breslow Thickness** | **Approximate 5 year survival** |
| --- | --- |
| \< 0\.75 mm | 95\-100% |
| 0\.76 \- 1\.50 mm | 80\-96% |
| 1\.51 \- 4 mm | 60\-75% |
| \> 4 mm | 50% |
