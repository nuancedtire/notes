Management options include  
* prevention of further risk: e.g. sun avoidance, sun cream
* fluorouracil cream: typically a 2 to 3 week course. The skin will become red and inflamed \- sometimes topical hydrocortisone is given following fluorouracil to help settle the inflammation
* topical diclofenac: may be used for mild AKs. Moderate efficacy but much fewer side\-effects
* topical imiquimod: trials have shown good efficacy
* cryotherapy
* curettage and cautery
