* I: Never tans, always burns (often red hair, freckles, and blue eyes)
* II: Usually tans, always burns
* III: Always tans, sometimes burns (usually dark hair and brown eyes)
* IV: Always tans, rarely burns (olive skin)
* V: Sunburn and tanning after extreme UV exposure (brown skin, e.g. Indian)
* VI: Black skin (e.g. Afro\-Caribbean), never tans, never burns
