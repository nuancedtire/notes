Antihistamines (H1 inhibitors) are of value in the treatment of allergic rhinitis and urticaria.   
  
Examples of sedating antihistamines  
* chlorpheniramine

  
As well as being sedating these antihistamines have some antimuscarinic properties (e.g. urinary retention, dry mouth).  
  
Examples of non\-sedating antihistamines  
* loratidine
* cetirizine

  
Of the non\-sedating antihistamines there is some evidence that cetirizine may cause more drowsiness than other drugs in the class.
