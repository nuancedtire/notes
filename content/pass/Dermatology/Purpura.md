Purpura describes bleeding into the skin from small blood vessels that produces a non\-blanching rash. Smaller petechiae (1\-2 mm in diameter) may also be seen. It is typically caused by low platelets but may also be seen with bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand disease.

Purpuric rash secondary to medication\-induced vasculitis  
It is important to recognise purpura as it can indicate the presence of serious underlying disease. Children with a new purpuric rash should be admitted immediately for investigations as it may be a sign of **meningococcal septicaemia or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia**. Parenteral antibiotics should be given prior to transfer if meningococcal septicaemia is suspected.  
  
Causes

| Children | Adults |
| --- | --- |
| • Meningococcal septicaemia• Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia• Congenital bleeding disorders• Immune thrombocytopenic purpura• Henoch\-Schonlein purpura• Non\-accidental injury | • Immune thrombocytopenic purpura• Bone marrow failure (secondary to leukaemias, myelodysplasia or bone metastases)• Senile purpura• Drugs (quinine, antiepileptics, antithrombotics)• Nutritional deficiencies (vitamins B12, C and folate) |

  
Raised superior vena cava pressure (e.g. secondary to a bad cough) may cause petechiae in the upper body but would not cause purpura.
