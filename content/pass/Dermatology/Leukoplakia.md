Leukoplakia is a premalignant condition which presents as white, hard spots on the mucous membranes of the mouth. It is more common in smokers.   
  
Leukoplakia is said to be a diagnosis of exclusion. Candidiasis and lichen planus should be considered, especially if the lesions can be 'rubbed off'  
  
Biopsies are usually performed to exclude alternative diagnoses such as squamous cell carcinoma and regular follow\-up is required to exclude malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma, which occurs in around 1% of patients.
