Impetigo is a superficial bacterial skin infection usually caused by either *Staphylcoccus aureus* or *Streptococcus pyogenes*. It can be a primary infection or a complication of an existing skin condition such as eczema (in this case), scabies or insect bites. Impetigo is common in children, particularly during warm weather.  
  
The infection can develop anywhere on the body but lesions tend to occur on the face, flexures and limbs not covered by clothing.  
  
Spread is by direct contact with discharges from the scabs of an infected person. The bacteria invade the skin through minor abrasions and then spread to other sites by scratching. Infection is spread mainly by the hands, but indirect spread via toys, clothing, equipment and the environment may occur. The incubation period is between 4 to 10 days.  
  
Features  
* 'golden', crusted skin lesions typically found around the mouth
* very contagious

Management
----------

  
Limited, localised disease  
* NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries now recommend **hydrogen peroxide 1% cream** for 'people who are not systemically unwell or at a high risk of complications'
	+ the change was announced in 2020 by NICE and Public Health England and seems aimed at cutting antibiotic resistance
	+ the evidence base shows it is just as effective at treating non\-bullous impetigo as a topical antibiotic
* topical antibiotic creams:
	+ topical fusidic acid
	+ topical mupirocin should be used if fusidic acid resistance is suspected
	+ MRSA is not susceptible to either fusidic acid or retapamulin. Topical mupirocin should, therefore, be used in this situation

  
Extensive disease  
* oral flucloxacillin
* oral erythromycin if penicillin\-allergic

  
School exclusion  
* children should be excluded from school until the lesions are crusted and healed or 48 hours after commencing antibiotic treatment
