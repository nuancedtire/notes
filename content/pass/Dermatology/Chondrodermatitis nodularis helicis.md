Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis (CNH) is a common and benign condition characterised by the development of a painful nodule on the ear. It is thought to be caused by factors such as persistent pressure on the ear (e.g. secondary to sleep, headsets), trauma or cold. CNH is more common in men and with increasing age.  
  
Management  
* reducing pressure on the ear: foam 'ear protectors' may be used during sleep
* other treatment options include cryotherapy, steroid injection, collagen injection
* surgical treatment may be used but there is a high recurrence rate
