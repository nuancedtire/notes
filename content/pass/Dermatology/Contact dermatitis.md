There are two main types of contact dermatitis  
* irritant contact dermatitis: common \- non\-allergic reaction due to weak acids or alkalis (e.g. detergents). Often seen on the hands. Erythema is typical, crusting and vesicles are rare
* allergic contact dermatitis: type IV hypersensitivity reaction. Uncommon \- often seen on the head following hair dyes. Presents as an acute weeping eczema which predominately affects the margins of the hairline rather than the hairy scalp itself. Topical treatment with a potent steroid is indicated

  
Cement is a frequent cause of contact dermatitis. The alkaline nature of cement may cause an irritant contact dermatitis whilst the dichromates in cement also can cause an allergic contact dermatitis
