Erythema ab igne is a skin disorder caused by over exposure to infrared radiation. Characteristic features include reticulated, erythematous patches with hyperpigmentation and telangiectasia. A typical history would be an elderly women who always sits next to an open fire.  
  
If the cause is not treated then patients may go on to develop squamous cell skin cancer.
