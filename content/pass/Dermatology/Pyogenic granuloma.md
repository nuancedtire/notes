Pyogenic granuloma is a relatively common benign skin lesion. The name is confusing as they are neither true granulomas nor pyogenic in nature. There are multiple alternative names but perhaps 'eruptive haemangioma' is the most useful.  
  
The cause of pyogenic granuloma is not known but a number of factors are linked:  
* trauma
* pregnancy
* more common in women and young adults

  
Features  
* most common sites are head/neck, upper trunk and hands. Lesions in the oral mucosa are common in pregnancy
* initially small red/brown spot
* rapidly progress within days to weeks forming raised, red/brown lesions which are often spherical in shape
* the lesions may bleed profusely or ulcerate

Management  
* lesions associated with pregnancy often resolve spontaneously post\-partum
* other lesions usually persist. Removal methods include curettage and cauterisation, cryotherapy, excision
