Differentiating guttate psoriasis and pityriasis rosea
------------------------------------------------------

  


|  | Guttate psoriasis | Pityriasis rosea |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Prodrome** | Classically preceded by a streptococcal sore throat 2\-4 weeks | Many patients report recent respiratory tract infections but this is not common in questions |
| **Appearance** | 'Tear drop', scaly papules on the trunk and limbs | Herald patch followed 1\-2 weeks later by multiple erythematous, slightly raised oval lesions with a fine scale confined to the outer aspects of the lesions. May follow a characteristic distribution with the longitudinal diameters of the oval lesions running parallel to the line of Langer. This may produce a 'fir\-tree' appearance |
| **Treatment / natural history** | Most cases resolve spontaneously within 2\-3 monthsTopical agents as per psoriasisUVB phototherapy | Self\-limiting, resolves after around 6 weeks |
