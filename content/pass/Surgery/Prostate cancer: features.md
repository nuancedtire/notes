Prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in adult males in the UK and is the second most common cause of death due to cancer in men after lung cancer.  
  
Risk factors  
* increasing age
* obesity
* Afro\-Caribbean ethnicity
* family history: around 5\-10% of cases have a strong family history

  
Localised prostate cancer is often asymptomatic. This is partly because cancers tend to develop in the periphery of the prostate and hence don't cause obstructive symptoms early on. Possible features include:  
* bladder outlet obstruction: hesitancy, urinary retention
* haematuria, haematospermia
* pain: back, perineal or testicular
* digital rectal examination: asymmetrical, hard, nodular enlargement with loss of median sulcus

Isotope bone scan (using technetium\-99m labelled diphosphonates which accumulate in the bones) from a patient with metastatic prostate cancer. The scan demonstrates multiple, irregular, randomly distributed foci of high grade activity involving the spine, ribs, sternum, pelvic and femoral bones. The findings are in keeping with multiple osteoblastic metastasis.
