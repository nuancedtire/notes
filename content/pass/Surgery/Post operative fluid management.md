Post operative fluid management

In the UK the GIFTASUP guidelines (see reference below) were devised to try and provide some consensus guidance as to how intravenous fluids should be administered. A decade ago it was a commonly held belief that little harm would occur as a result of excessive administration of normal saline and many oliguric postoperative patients received enormous quantities of IV fluids. As a result, they developed hyperchloraemic acidosis. With a greater understanding of this potential complication, the use of electrolyte balanced solutions (Ringers lactate/ Hartmans) is now favoured over normal saline. In addition to this, solutions of 5% dextrose and dextrose/saline combinations are now generally not recommended for surgical patients. The other guidance includes:  
* Fluids given should be documented clearly and easily available
* Assess the patient's fluid status when they leave theatre
* If a patient is haemodynamically stable and euvolaemic, aim to restart oral fluid intake as soon as possible
* Review patients whose urinary sodium is \< 20
* If a patient is oedematous, hypovolaemia if present should be treated first. This should then be followed by a negative balance of sodium and water, monitored using urine Na excretion levels.
* Solutions such as Dextran 70 should be used in caution in patients with sepsis as there is a risk of developing acute renal injury.
