Three main patterns of presentation may be seen in patients with peripheral arterial disease:  
* intermittent claudication
* critical limb ischaemia
* acute limb\-threatening ischaemia

  
Acute limb\-threatening ischaemia
---------------------------------

  
Features \- 1 or more of the 6 P's  
* pale
* pulseless
* painful
* paralysed
* paraesthetic
* 'perishing with cold'

  
Initial investigations should include a handheld arterial Doppler examination. If Doppler signals are present, an ankle\-brachial pressure index (ABI) should also be obtained.  
  
An attempt is generally made to determine whether the ischaemia is due to a thrombus (due to rupture of atherosclerotic plaque) and embolus (e.g. secondary to atrial fibrillation):  
  


| Factors suggestive of thrombus | Factors suggestive of embolus |
| --- | --- |
| * pre\-existing claudication with sudden deterioration * no obvious source for emboli * reduced or absent pulses in contralateral limb * evidence of widespread vascular disease (e.g. myocardial infarction, stroke, TIA, previous vascular surgery) | - sudden onset of painful leg (\< 24 hour) - no history of claudication - clinically obvious source of embolus (e.g. atrial fibrillation, recent myocardial infarction) - no evidence of peripheral vascular disease (normal pulses in contralateral limb) - evidence of proximal aneurysm (e.g. abdominal or popliteal) |

  
Management
----------

  
Initial management  
* ABC approach
* analgesia: IV opioids are often used
* intravenous unfractionated heparin is usually given to prevent thrombus propagation, particularly if the patient is not suitable for immediate surgery
* vascular review

  
Definitive management:  
* intra\-arterial thrombolysis
* surgical embolectomy
* angioplasty
* bypass surgery
* amputation: for patients with irreversible ischaemia
