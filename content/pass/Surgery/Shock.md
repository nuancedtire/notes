Shock occurs when there is insufficient tissue perfusion. The pathophysiology of shock may be divided into the following aetiological groups:  
* Septic
* Haemorrhagic
* Neurogenic
* Cardiogenic
* Anaphylactic

  
Septic shock
------------

  
Septic shock is a major problem and those patients with severe sepsis have a mortality rate in excess of 40%. In those who are admitted to intensive care mortality ranges from 6% with no organ failure to 65% in those with 4 organ failure.  
  
Sepsis is **defined as an infection that triggers a particular Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS).** This is characterised by body temperature outside 36 oC \- 38 o C, HR \>90 beats/min, respiratory rate \>20/min, WBC count \>12,000/mm3 or \< 4,000/mm3.  
  
Patients with infections and two or more elements of SIRS meet the diagnostic criteria for sepsis. Those with organ failure have severe sepsis and those with refractory hypotension \-septic shock.  
  
During the septic process there is marked activation of the immune system with **extensive cytokine release**. This may be coupled with or triggered by systemic circulation of bacterial toxins. These all cause endothelial cell damage and neutrophil adhesion. The overall hallmarks are thus those of **excessive inflammation, coagulation and fibrinolytic suppression**.  
  
The surviving sepsis campaign (2012\) highlights the following key areas for attention:  
* Prompt administration of antibiotics to cover all likely pathogens coupled with a rigorous search for the source of infection.
* Haemodynamic stabilisation. Many patients are hypovolaemic and require aggressive fluid administration. Aim for CVP 8\-12 cm H2O, MAP \>65mmHg.
* Modulation of the septic response. This includes manoeuvres to counteract the changes and includes measures such as tight glycaemic control. The routine use of steroids is not advised.

  
In surgical patients, the main groups with septic shock include those with anastomotic leaks, abscesses and extensive superficial infections such as necrotising fasciitis. When performing surgery the aim should be to undertake the minimum necessary to restore physiology. These patients do not fare well with prolonged surgery. Definitive surgery can be more safely undertaken when physiology is restored and clotting, in particular, has been normalised.  
  
  
Haemorrhagic shock
------------------

  
The average adult blood volume comprises 7% of body weight. Thus in the 70 Kg adult this will equate to 5 litres. This changes in children (8\-9% body weight) and is slightly lower in the elderly.   
  
The table below outlines the 4 major classes of haemorrhagic shock and their associated physiological sequelae:  
  


| **Parameter** | **Class I** | **Class II** | **Class III** | **Class IV** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Blood loss ml | \<750ml | 750\-1500ml | 1500\-2000ml | \>2000ml |
| Blood loss % | \<15% | 15\-30% | 30\-40% | \>40% |
| Pulse rate | \<100 | \>100 | \>120 | \>140ml |
| Blood pressure | Normal | Normal | Decreased | Decreased |
| Respiratory rate | 14\-20 | 20\-30 | 30\-40 | \>35 |
| Urine output | \>30ml | 20\-30ml | 5\-15ml | \<5ml |
| Symptoms | Normal | Anxious | Confused | Lethargic |

  
In patients suffering from trauma, the most likely cause of shock is haemorrhage. However, the following may also be the cause or occur concomitantly:  
  
* Tension pneumothorax
* Spinal cord injury
* Myocardial contusion
* Cardiac tamponade

  
When assessing trauma patients it is worth remembering that in order to generate a palpable femoral pulse an arterial pressure of \>65mmHg is required.   
  
Once bleeding is controlled and circulating volume normalised the levels of transfusion should be to maintain a Hb of 7\-8 in those with no risk factors for tissue hypoxia and Hb 10 for those who have such risk factors.  
  
  
Neurogenic shock
----------------

  
This occurs most often following a **spinal cord transection**, usually at a high level. There is a resultant interruption of the autonomic nervous system. The result is either **decreased sympathetic tone or increased parasympathetic tone**, the effect of which is a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance mediated by marked vasodilation.   
  
This results in decreased preload and thus decreased cardiac output (Starling's law). There is decreased peripheral tissue perfusion and shock is thus produced. In contrast with many other types of shock peripheral vasoconstrictors are used to return vascular tone to normal.   
  
  
Cardiogenic shock
-----------------

  
In medical patients the main cause is **ischaemic heart disease**. In the traumatic setting, direct myocardial trauma or contusion is more likely. Evidence of ECG changes and overlying sternal fractures or contusions should raise the suspicion of injury. Treatment is largely supportive and transthoracic echocardiography should be used to determine evidence of pericardial fluid or direct myocardial injury. The measurement of troponin levels in trauma patients may be undertaken but they are less useful in delineating the extent of myocardial trauma than following MI.  
  
When cardiac injury is of a blunt nature and is associated with cardiogenic shock the right side of the heart is the most likely site of injury with chamber and or valve rupture. These patients require surgery to repair these defects and will require cardiopulmonary bypass to achieve this. Some may require intra\-aortic balloon pump as a bridge to surgery.  
  
  
Anaphylactic shock
------------------

  
Anaphylaxis may be defined as a severe, life\-threatening, generalised or systemic hypersensitivity reaction.  
  
Anaphylaxis is one of the few times when you would not have time to look up the dose of a medication. The Resuscitation Council guidelines on anaphylaxis have recently been updated. Adrenaline is by far the most important drug in anaphylaxis and should be given as soon as possible.   
Adrenaline can be repeated every 5 minutes if necessary. The best site for IM injection is the anterolateral aspect of the middle third of the thigh.  
  
Common identified causes of anaphylaxis  
* food (e.g. Nuts) \- the most common cause in children
* drugs
* venom (e.g. Wasp sting)
