**Lidocaine**  
* An amide
* Local anaesthetic and a less commonly used antiarrhythmic (affects Na channels in the axon)
* Hepatic metabolism, protein bound, renally excreted
* Toxicity: due to IV or excess administration. Increased risk if liver dysfunction or low protein states. Note acidosis causes lidocaine to detach from protein binding. Local anesthetic toxicity can be treated with IV 20% lipid emulsion
* Drug interactions: Beta blockers, ciprofloxacin, phenytoin
* Features of toxicity: Initial CNS over activity then depression as lidocaine initially blocks inhibitory pathways then blocks both inhibitory and activating pathways. Cardiac arrhythmias.
* Increased doses may be used when combined with adrenaline to limit systemic absorption.

  
**Cocaine**  
* Pure cocaine is a salt, usually cocaine hydrochloride. It is supplied for local anaesthetic purposes as a paste.
* It is supplied for clinical use in concentrations of 4 and 10%. It may be applied topically to the nasal mucosa. It has a rapid onset of action and has the additional advantage of causing marked vasoconstriction.
* It is lipophillic and will readily cross the blood brain barrier. Its systemic effects also include cardiac arrhythmias and tachycardia.
* Apart from its limited use in ENT surgery it is otherwise used rarely in mainstream surgical practice.

  
**Bupivacaine**  
* Bupivacaine binds to the intracellular portion of sodium channels and blocks sodium influx into nerve cells, which prevents depolarization.
* It has a much longer duration of action than lignocaine and this is of use in that it may be used for topical wound infiltration at the conclusion of surgical procedures with long duration analgesic effect.
* It is cardiotoxic and is therefore contra indicated in regional blockage in case the tourniquet fails.
* Levobupivicaine (Chirocaine) is less cardiotoxic and causes less vasodilation.

  
**Prilocaine**  
* Similar mechanism of action to other local anaesthetic agents. However, it is far less cardiotoxic and is therefore the agent of choice for intravenous regional anaesthesia e.g. Biers Block.

  
All local anaesthetic agents dissociate in tissues and this contributes to their therapeutic effect. The dissociation constant shifts in tissues that are acidic e.g. where an abscess is present, and this reduces the efficacy.  
  
**Doses of local anaesthetics**  


| **Agent** | **Dose plain** | **Dose with adrenaline** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lignocaine | 3mg/Kg | 7mg/Kg |
| Bupivacaine | 2mg/Kg | 2mg/Kg |
| Prilocaine | 6mg/Kg | 9mg/Kg |

These are a guide only as actual doses depend on site of administration, tissue vascularity and co\-morbidities.  
  
**Maximum total local anaesthetic doses**  
* Lignocaine 1% plain \- 3mg/ Kg \- 200mg (20ml)
* Lignocaine 1% with 1 in 200,000 adrenaline \- 7mg/Kg \- 500mg (50ml)
* Bupivicaine 0\.5% \- 2mg/kg\- 150mg (30ml)

*Maximum doses are based on ideal body weight*  
  
**Effects of adrenaline**  
Adrenaline may be added to local anaesthetic drugs. It prolongs the duration of action at the site of injection and permits usage of higher doses (see above). It is contra indicated in patients taking MAOI's or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of bupivacaine is related to protein binding and addition of adrenaline to this drug does not permit increases in the total dose of bupivacaine, in contrast to the situation with lignocaine.
