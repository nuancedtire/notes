| **Disorder** | **Incidence and causation** | **Age at presentation** | **Diagnosis** | **Treatment** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Duodenal atresia | 1 in 5000 (higher in Downs syndrome) | Few hours after birth | AXR shows double bubble sign, contrast study may confirm | Duodenoduodenostomy |
| Malrotation with volvulus | Usually cause by incomplete rotation during embryogenesis | Usually 3\-7 days after birth, volvulus with compromised circulation may result in peritoneal signs and haemodynamic instability | Upper GI contrast study may show DJ flexure is more medially placed, USS may show abnormal orientation of SMA and SMV | Ladd's procedure |
| Jejunal/ ileal atresia | Usually caused by vascular insufficiency in utero, usually 1 in 3000 | Usually within 24 hours of birth | AXR will show air\-fluid levels | Laparotomy with primary resection and anastomosis |
| Meconium ileus | Occurs in between 15 and20% of those babies with cystic fibrosis, otherwise 1 in 5000 | Typically in first 24\-48 hours of life with abdominal distension and bilious vomiting | Air \- fluid levels on AXR, sweat test to confirm cystic fibrosis | Surgical decompression, serosal damage may require segmental resection |
| Necrotising enterocolitis | Up to 2\.4 per 1000 births, risks increased in prematurity and inter\-current illness | Usually second week of life | Dilated bowel loops on AXR, pneumatosis and portal venous air | Conservative and supportive for non perforated cases, laparotomy and resection in cases of perforation of ongoing clinical deterioration |
