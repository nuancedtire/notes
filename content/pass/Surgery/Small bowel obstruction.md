In small bowel obstruction, the passage of food, fluids and gas, through the small intestines becomes blocked.  
  
Adhesions (e.g. following previous surgery) are the most common cause of small bowel obstruction, followed by hernias.  
  
Features  
* diffuse, central abdominal pain
* nausea and vomiting
	+ typically bilious vomiting
* 'constipation' with complete obstruction and lack of flatulence
* abdominal distension may be apparent, particularly with lower levels of obstruction
* 'tinkling' bowel sounds (more common in early bowel obstruction)

  
Abdominal x\-ray  
* generally first\-line imaging for suspected small bowel obstruction
* distended small bowel loops with fluid levels
	+ considered dilated if small bowel is \>3cm diameter

  
CT is the definitive investigation and is more sensitive, particularly in early obstruction.  
  
Management  
* intial steps:
	+ NBM
	+ IV fluids
	+ nasogastric tube with free drainage
* some patients settle with conservative management but otherwise will require surgery
