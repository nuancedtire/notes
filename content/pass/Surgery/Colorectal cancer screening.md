Overview  
* most cancers develop from adenomatous polyps. Screening for colorectal cancer has been shown to reduce mortality by 16%
* the NHS offers home\-based, **Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT)** screening to older adults
* a one\-off flexible sigmoidoscopy at the age of 55 years was trialled in England but was abandoned in 2021
	+ this mainly due to an inability to recruit enough clinical endoscopist, exacerbated by the covid\-19 pandemic
	+ the trial, partly funded by Cancer Research UK, had shown promising early results and it remains to be seen whether flexible sigmoidoscopy will be used as part of a future bowel screening programme

  
  
Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) screening
------------------------------------------

  
Key points  
* the NHS now has a national screening programme offering screening every 2 years to all men and women aged 60 to 74 years in England, 50 to 74 years in Scotland. Patients aged over 74 years may request screening
* eligible patients are sent Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) tests through the post
* a type of faecal occult blood (FOB) test which uses antibodies that specifically recognise human haemoglobin (Hb)
* used to detect, and can quantify, the amount of human blood in a single stool sample
* advantages over conventional FOB tests is that it only detects human haemoglobin, as opposed to animal haemoglobin ingested through diet
* only one faecal sample is needed compared to the 2\-3 for conventional FOB tests
* whilst a numerical value is generated, this is not reported to the patient or GP, who will instead be informed if the test is normal or abnormal
* patients with abnormal results are offered a colonoscopy

  
At colonoscopy, approximately:  
* 5 out of 10 patients will have a normal exam
* 4 out of 10 patients will be found to have polyps which may be removed due to their premalignant potential
* 1 out of 10 patients will be found to have cancer
