The majority of patients who develop an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) are asymptomatic. Given the high mortality associated with a ruptured AAA it is therefore beneficial to screen patients. Screening for an abdominal aortic aneurysm consists of a single abdominal ultrasound for males aged 65\.  
  
  
Screening outcome
-----------------

  


| Aorta width | Interpretation | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \< 3 cm | Normal | No further action |
| 3 \- 4\.4 cm | Small aneurysm | Rescan every 12 months |
| 4\.5 \- 5\.4 cm | Medium aneurysm | Rescan every 3 months |
| â‰¥ 5\.5cm | Large aneurysm | Refer within 2 weeks to vascular surgery for probable interventionOnly found in 1 per 1,000 screened patients |

  
  
Further management
------------------

  
Low rupture risk  
* asymptomatic, aortic diameter \< 5\.5cm (i.e. small and medium aneurysms)
* abdominal US surveillance (on time\-scales outlines above) and optimise cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. stop smoking)

  
High rupture risk  
* symptomatic, aortic diameter \>\=5\.5cm or rapidly enlarging (\>1cm/year)
* refer within 2 weeks to vascular surgery for probable intervention
* treat with elective endovascular repair (EVAR) or open repair if unsuitable. In EVAR a stent is placed into the abdominal aorta via the femoral artery to prevent blood from collecting in the aneurysm. A complication of EVAR is an endo\-leak, where the stent fails to exclude blood from the aneurysm, and usually presents without symptoms on routine follow\-up.
