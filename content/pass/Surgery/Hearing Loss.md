Hearing loss may be conductive or sensorineural. To determine which is present patients will often require a formal assessment with pure tone audiometry. In the clinical setting Webers and Rinnes tests may be helpful in categorising various types of hearing loss.  
  
**Webers and Rinnes Tests**  
In a normal patient, the Weber tuning fork sound is heard equally loud in both ears with no one ear hearing the sound louder than the other. A patient with symmetrical hearing loss will hear the Weber tuning fork sound equally well with diagnostic utility only in asymmetric (one\-sided) hearing losses. In a patient with asymmetrical hearing loss, the Weber tuning fork sound is heard louder in one ear versus the other. This clinical finding should be confirmed by repeating the procedure and having the patient occlude one ear with a finger; the sound should be heard best in the occluded ear.
