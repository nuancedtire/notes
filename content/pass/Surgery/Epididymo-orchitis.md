Epididymo\-orchitis describes an infection of the epididymis \+/\- testes resulting in pain and swelling. It is most commonly caused by local spread of infections from the genital tract (such as *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, typically seen in sexually active younger adults) or the bladder (*E. coli*, typically seen in older adults with a low\-risk sexual history).  
  
Features  
* unilateral testicular pain and swelling
* urethral discharge may be present, but urethritis is often asymptomatic
* factors suggesting testicular torsion include patients \< 20 years, severe pain and an acute onset

  
The **most important differential diagnosis is testicular torsion**. This needs to be excluded urgently to prevent ischaemia of the testicle.  
  
Investigations are typically guided by the age of the patient  
* in younger adults assess for sexually transmitted infections (STI)
* in older adults with a low\-risk sexual history send a mid\-stream urine (MSU) for microscopy and culture

  
Management  
* if an STI is the most likely cause advise urgent referral to a local specialist sexual health clinic [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/scrotal-pain-swelling/management/epididymo-orchitis/#:~:text=If%20an%20STI%20is%20the%20most%20likely%20cause%2C%20advise%20urgent%20referral%20to%20a%20local%20specialist%20sexual%20health%20clinic "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - Epididymo-orchitis")
	+ if the organism is unknown BASHH recommend: ceftriaxone 500mg intramuscularly single dose, plus doxycycline 100mg by mouth twice daily for 10\-14 days
* if enteric organisms are the most likely cause [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/scrotal-pain-swelling/management/epididymo-orchitis/#:~:text=If%20an%20enteric%20organism%20is%20the%20most%20likely%20cause "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - Epididymo-orchitis")
	+ send an MSU as above
	+ treating empirically with an oral quinolone for 2 weeks (e.g. ofloxacin)
* further investigations following treatment may be recommended to exclude any underlying structural abnormalities
