Testicular cancer is the most common malignancy in men aged 20\-30 years. Around 95% of cases of testicular cancer are germ\-cell tumours. Germ cell tumours may essentially be divided into:  
* seminomas
* non\-seminomas: including embryonal, yolk sac, teratoma and choriocarcinoma

  
Non\-germ cell tumours include Leydig cell tumours and sarcomas.  
  
The peak incidence for teratomas is 25 years and seminomas is 35 years. Risk factors include:   
* infertility (increases risk by a factor of 3\)
* cryptorchidism
* family history
* Klinefelter's syndrome
* mumps orchitis

  
Features  
* a painless lump is the most common presenting symptom
* pain may also be present in a minority of men
* hydrocele
* gynaecomastia
	+ this occurs due to an increased oestrogen:androgen ratio
	+ germ\-cell tumours → hCG → Leydig cell dysfunction → increases in both oestradiol and testosterone production, but rise in oestradiol is relatively greater than testosterone
	+ leydig cell tumours → directly secrete more oestradiol and convert additional androgen precursors to oestrogens

  
Tumour markers  
* germ cell tumours
	+ seminomas: seminomas: hCG may be elevated in around 20%
	+ non\-seminomas: AFP and/or beta\-hCG are elevated in 80\-85%
	+ LDH is elevated in around 40% of germ cell tumours

  
Diagnosis  
* ultrasound is first\-line

  
Management  
* treatment depends on whether the tumour is a seminoma or a non\-seminoma
* orchidectomy
* chemotherapy and radiotherapy may be given depending on staging and tumour type

  
Prognosis is generally excellent  
* 5 year survival for seminomas is around 95% if Stage I
* 5 year survival for teratomas is around 85% if Stage I
