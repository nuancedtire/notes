The British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) published guidelines in 2018 and NICE in 2019 on the management of acute ureteric/renal colic.  
  
Initial management of renal colic
---------------------------------

  
Pain management and medical therapy   
* both BAUS and NICE recommend an NSAID as the analgesia of choice for renal colic [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng118/chapter/Recommendations#pain-management:~:text=1.2-,Pain%20management,-1.2.1 "NICE - 2019 Renal and ureteric stones: assessment and management")
	+ whilst diclofenac has been traditionally used the increased risk of cardiovascular events with certain NSAIDs (e.g. diclofenac, ibuprofen) should be considered when prescribing
* if NSAIDs are contraindicated or not giving sufficient pain relief NICE recommend IV paracetamol
* the CKS guidelines suggest for patients who require admission: '*Administer a parenteral analgesic (such as intramuscular diclofenac) for rapid relief of severe pain*'
* alpha blockers [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng118/chapter/Recommendations#pain-management:~:text=1.3-,Medical%20expulsive%20therapy,-1.3.1 "NICE - 2019 Renal and ureteric stones: assessment and management")
	+ promote smooth muscle relaxation and dilation of the ureter. potentially easing stone passage
	+ NICE recommend these are considered for distal ureteric stones less than 10 mm in size
	+ BAUS don't formally recommend but do however acknowledge a recently published meta\-analysis advocates the use of Î±\-blockers for patients amenable to conservative management, with the greatest benefit amongst those with larger stones

  
Initial investigations  
* urine dipstick and culture
* serum creatinine and electrolytes: check renal function
* FBC / CRP: look for associated infection
* calcium/urate: look for underlying causes
* stone analysis should be considered once the stone has passed
* also: clotting if percutaneous intervention planned and blood cultures if pyrexial or other signs of sepsis

  
Imaging  
* non\-contrast CT KUB should be performed on all patients, within 24 hours of admission [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng118/chapter/Recommendations#pain-management:~:text=hours%20of%20presentation)-,low%2Ddose%20non%2Dcontrast%20CT,-to%20adults%20with "NICE - 2019 Renal and ureteric stones: assessment and management")
	+ if a patient has a fever, a solitary kidney or when the diagnosis is uncertain an immediate CT KUB should be performed. In the case of an uncertain diagnosis, this is to exclude other diagnoses such as ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm
	+ CT KUB has a sensitivity of 97% for ureteric stones and a specificity of 95%
* ultrasound should be used for pregnant women and children
	+ the sensitivity of ultrasound for stones is around 45% and specificity is around 90%

  
  
Management of renal stones
--------------------------

  
Simplified first\-line NICE guidance (please see guidelines for more details) [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng118/chapter/Recommendations#medical-expulsive-therapy:~:text=before%20surgery.-,1.5%20Surgical%20treatments,-(including%20shockwave%20lithotripsy "NICE - 2019 Renal and ureteric stones: assessment and management")   
* Renal stones
	+ watchful waiting if \< 5mm and asymptomatic
	+ 5\-10mm shockwave lithotripsy
	+ 10\-20 mm shockwave lithotripsy OR ureteroscopy
	+ \> 20 mm percutaneous nephrolithotomy
* Uretic stones
	+ shockwave lithotripsy \+/\- alpha blockers\>\< 10mm shockwave lithotripsy \+/\- alpha blockers
	+ 10\-20 mm ureteroscopy

  
  
### Further details

  
Stones \< 5 mm will usually pass spontaneously. Lithotripsy and nephrolithotomy may be for severe cases.  
  
Most renal stones measuring less than 5mm in maximum diameter will typically pass within 4 weeks of symptom onset. More intensive and urgent treatment is indicated in the presence of ureteric obstruction, renal developmental abnormality such as horseshoe kidney and previous renal transplant. Ureteric obstruction due to stones together with infection is a surgical emergency and the system must be decompressed. Options include nephrostomy tube placement, insertion of ureteric catheters and ureteric stent placement.   
  
Shockwave lithotripsy  
* A shock wave is generated external to the patient, internally cavitation bubbles and mechanical stress lead to stone fragmentation
	+ The passage of shock waves can result in the development of solid organ injury
	+ Fragmentation of larger stones may result in the development of ureteric obstruction
	+ The procedure is uncomfortable for patients and analgesia is required during the procedure and afterwards.

  
Ureteroscopy  
* A ureteroscope is passed retrograde through the ureter and into the renal pelvis
	+ It is indicated in individuals (e.g. pregnant females) where lithotripsy is contraindicated and in complex stone disease
	+ In most cases a stent is left in situ for 4 weeks after the procedure.

  
Percutaneous nephrolithotomy  
* In this procedure, access is gained to the renal collecting system
* Once access is achieved, intra corporeal lithotripsy or stone fragmentation is performed and stone fragments removed.

  
Prevention of renal stones
--------------------------

  
Calcium stones may be due to hypercalciuria, which is found in up to 5\-10% of the general population.   
* high fluid intake
* add lemon juice to drinking water
* avoid carbonated drinks
* limit salt intake
* potassium citrate may be beneficial [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng118/chapter/Recommendations#medical-expulsive-therapy:~:text=weight%20gain.-,Potassium%20citrate,-The%20following%20recommendations "NICE - 2019 Renal and ureteric stones: assessment and management")
* thiazides diuretics (increase distal tubular calcium resorption)

  
Oxalate stones  
* cholestyramine reduces urinary oxalate secretion
* pyridoxine reduces urinary oxalate secretion

  
Uric acid stones  
* allopurinol
* urinary alkalinization e.g. oral bicarbonate
