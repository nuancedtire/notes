In addition to airway adjuncts, there are a number of simple positional manoeuvres which can open the airway:  
* head tilt / chin lift
* jaw thrust: preferred if concern about cervical spine injury

  


| Device | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Oropharyngeal airway** | * Easy to insert and use * No paralysis required * Ideal for very short procedures * Most often used as a bridge to more definitive airway |
| **Laryngeal mask** | * Widely used * Very easy to insert * Device sits in pharynx and aligns to cover the airway * Poor control against reflux of gastric contents * Paralysis is not usually required * Commonly used for wide range of anaesthetic uses, especially in day surgery * Not suitable for high\-pressure ventilation (small amount of PEEP often possible) |
| **Tracheostomy** | * Reduces the work of breathing (and dead space) * May be useful in slow weaning * Percutaneous tracheostomy widely used in ITU * Dries secretions, humidified air usually required |
| **Endotracheal tube** | * Provides optimal control of the airway once the cuff inflated * May be used for long or short\-term ventilation * Errors in insertion may result in oesophageal intubation 	+ accounts for around 5% of major airway complications 	+ therefore monitor end\-tidal CO2 (capnography) * Paralysis often required * Higher ventilation pressures can be used |
