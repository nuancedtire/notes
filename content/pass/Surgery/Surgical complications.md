Complications occur in all branches of surgery and require vigilance in their detection. In many cases anticipating the likely complications and appropriate avoidance will minimise their occurrence. For the purposes of the exam the important principles to appreciate are:  
  
* The anatomical principles that underpin complications
* The physiological and biochemical derangements that occur
* The most appropriate diagnostic modalities to utilise
* The principles which underpin their management

  
This is clearly a very broad area and impossible to cover comprehensively. There is considerable overlap with other topic areas within the website.  
  
Avoiding complications
----------------------

  
Some points to hopefully avert complications:  
  
* World Health Organisation checklist\- now mandatory prior to all operations
* Prophylactic antibiotics \- right dose, right drug, right time.
* Assess DVT/ PE risk and ensure adequate prophylaxis
* **MARK** site of surgery
* Use tourniquets with caution and with respect for underlying structures
* Remember the danger of end arteries and in situations where they occur avoid using adrenaline containing solutions and monopolar diathermy.
* Handle tissues with care\- devitalised tissue serves as a nidus for infection
* Be very wary of the potential for coupling injuries when using diathermy during laparoscopic surgery
* The inferior epigastric artery is a favorite target for laparoscopic ports and surgical drains!

  
  
**Anatomical principles**  
Understanding the anatomy of a surgical field will allow appreciation of local and systemic complications that may occur. For example nerve injuries may occur following surgery in specific regions the table below lists some of the more important nerves to consider and mechanisms of injury  
  


| **Nerve** | **Mechanism** |
| --- | --- |
| Accessory | Posterior triangle lymph node biopsy |
| Sciatic | Posterior approach to hip |
| Common peroneal | Legs in Lloyd Davies position |
| Long thoracic | Axillary node clearance |
| Pelvic autonomic nerves | Pelvic cancer surgery |
| Recurrent laryngeal nerves | During thyroid surgery |
| Hypoglossal nerve | During carotid endarterectomy |
| Ulnar and median nerves | During upper limb fracture repairs |

  
These are just a few. The detailed functional sequelae are particularly important and will often be tested. In addition to nerve injuries certain procedures carry risks of visceral or structural injury. Again some particular favorites are given below:  
  


| **Structure** | **Mechanism** |
| --- | --- |
| Thoracic duct | During thoracic surgery e.g. Pneumonectomy, oesphagectomy |
| Parathyroid glands | During difficult thyroid surgery |
| Ureters | During colonic resections/ gynaecological surgery |
| Bowel perforation | Use of Verres Needle to establish pneumoperitoneum |
| Bile duct injury | Failure to delineate Calots triangle carefully and careless use of diathermy |
| Facial nerve | Always at risk during Parotidectomy |
| Tail of pancreas | When ligating splenic hilum |
| Testicular vessels | During re\-do open hernia surgery |
| Hepatic veins | During liver mobilisation |

  
Again many could be predicted from the anatomy of the procedure.   
  
  
**Physiological derangements**  
A very common complication is bleeding and this is covered under the section of haemorrhagic shock. Another variant is infection either superficial or deep seated. The organisms are covered under microbiology and the features of sepsis covered under shock. Do not forget that immunocompromised and elderly patients may present will atypical physiological parameters.   
  
Selected physiological and biochemical issues are given below:  
  


| **Complication** | **Physiological/ Biochemical Problem** |
| --- | --- |
| Arrhythmias following cardiac surgery | Susceptibility to hypokalaemia (K\+ \<4\.0 in cardiac patients) |
| Neurosurgical electrolyte disturbance | SIADH following cranial surgery causing hyponatraemia |
| Ileus following gastrointestinal surgery | Fluid sequestration and loss of electrolytes |
| Pulmonary oedema following pneumonectomy | Loss of lung volume makes these patients very sensitive to fluid overload |
| Anastamotic leak | Generalised sepsis causing mediastinitis or peritonitis depending on site of leak |
| Myocardial infarct | May follow any type of surgery and in addition to direct cardiac effects the decreased cardiac output may well compromise grafts etc. |

  
  
Try making a short list of problems and causes specific to your own clinical area.  
  
**Diagnostic modalities**  
Depends largely on the suspected complication. In the acutely unwell surgical patient the following baseline investigations are often helpful:  
* Full blood count, urea and electrolytes, C\- reactive protein (trend rather than absolute value), serum calcium, liver function tests, clotting (don't forget to repeat if on\-going bleeding)
* Arterial blood gases
* ECG (\+cardiac enzymes if MI suspected)
* Chest x\-ray to identify collapse/ consolidation
* Urine analysis for UTI

  
These will often identify the most common complications.   
  
**Special tests**  
* CT scanning for identification of intra\-abdominal abscesses, air and if luminal contrast is used an anastamotic leak
* Gatrograffin enema\- for rectal anastamotic leaks
* Doppler USS of leg veins\- for identification of DVT
* CTPA for PE
* Sending peritoneal fluid for U\+E (if ureteric injury suspected) or amylase (if pancreatic injury suspected)
* Echocardiogram if pericardial effusion suspected post cardiac surgery and no pleural window made.

  
**Management of complications**  
The guiding principal should be safe and timely intervention. Patients should be stabilised and if an operation needs to occur in tandem with resuscitation then generally this should be of a damage limitation type procedure rather than definitive surgery (which can be more safely undertaken in a stable patient the following day).   
  
Remember that recent surgery is a contra indication to thrombolysis and that in some patients IV heparin may be preferable to a low molecular weight heparin (easier to reverse).  
  
As a general rule laparotomies for bleeding should follow the core principle of quadrant packing and then subsequent pack removal rather than plunging large clamps into pools of blood. The latter approach invariable worsens the situation is often accompanied by significant visceral injury particularly when done by the inexperienced. If packing controls a situation it is entirely acceptable practice to leave packs in situ and return the patient to ITU for pack removal the subsequent day.
