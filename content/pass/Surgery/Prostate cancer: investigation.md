The traditional investigation for suspected prostate cancer was a transrectal ultrasound\-guided (TRUS) biopsy. However, recent guidelines from NICE have now advocated the increasing use of multiparametric MRI as a first\-line investigation.  
  
Complications of TRUS biopsy:  
* sepsis: 1% of cases
* pain: lasting \>\= 2 weeks in 15% and severe in 7%
* fever: 5%
* haematuria and rectal bleeding

  
Multiparametric MRI is now the first\-line investigation for people with suspected clinically localised prostate cancer.  
* the results are reported using a 5\-point Likert scale

  
If the Likert scale is \>\=3 a multiparametric MRI\-influenced prostate biopsy is offered  
  
If the Likert scale is 1\-2 then NICE recommend discussing with the patient the pros and cons of having a biopsy.
