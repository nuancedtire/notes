Criteria for brain stem death testing  
* Deep coma of known aetiology
* Reversible causes excluded
* No sedation
* Normal electrolytes

  
Testing for brain death  
* Fixed pupils which do not respond to sharp changes in the intensity of incident light
* No corneal reflex
* Absent oculo\-vestibular reflexes \- no eye movements following the slow injection of at least 50ml of ice\-cold water into each ear in turn (the caloric test)
* No response to supraorbital pressure
* No cough reflex to bronchial stimulation or gagging response to pharyngeal stimulation
* No observed respiratory effort in response to disconnection of the ventilator for long enough (typically 5 minutes) to ensure elevation of the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide to at least 6\.0 kPa (6\.5 kPa in patients with chronic carbon dioxide retention). Adequate oxygenation is ensured by pre\-oxygenation and diffusion oxygenation during the disconnection (so the brain stem respiratory centre is not challenged by the ultimate, anoxic, drive stimulus)

  
The test should be undertaken by two appropriately experienced doctors on two separate occasions. Both should be experienced in performing brain stem death testing and have at least 5 years post\-graduate experience. One of them must be a consultant. Neither can be a member of the transplant team (if organ donation contemplated).
