| **Oral intake** | * Easiest option * May be supplemented by calorie rich dietary supplements * May contra indicated following certain procedures |
| --- | --- |
| **Naso gastric feeding** | * Usually administered via fine bore naso gastric feeding tube * Complications relate to aspiration of feed or misplaced tube * May be safe to use in patients with impaired swallow * Often contra indicated following head injury due to risks associated with tube insertion |
| **Naso jejunal feeding** | * Avoids problems of feed pooling in stomach (and risk of aspiration) * Insertion of feeding tube more technically complicated (easiest if done intra operatively) * Safe to use following oesophagogastric surgery |
| **Feeding jejunostomy** | * Surgically sited feeding tube * May be used for long term feeding * Low risk of aspiration and thus safe for long term feeding following upper GI surgery * Main risks are those of tube displacement and peritubal leakage immediately following insertion, which carries a risk of peritonitis |
| **Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy** | * Combined endoscopic and percutaneous tube insertion * May not be technically possible in those patients who cannot undergo successful endoscopy * Risks include aspiration and leakage at the insertion site |
| **Total parenteral nutrition** | * The definitive option in those patients in whom enteral feeding is contra indicated * Individualised prescribing and monitoring needed * Should be administered via a central vein as it is strongly phlebitic * Long term use is associated with fatty liver and deranged LFT's |
