Anal fissures are longitudinal or elliptical tears of the squamous lining of the distal anal canal. If present for less than 6 weeks they are defined as acute, and chronic if present for more than 6 weeks.   
  
Risk factors  
* constipation
* inflammatory bowel disease
* sexually transmitted infections e.g. HIV, syphilis, herpes

  
Features  
* painful, bright red, rectal bleeding
* around 90% of anal fissures occur on the posterior midline.
	+ if the fissures are found in alternative locations then other underlying causes should be considered e.g. Crohn's disease

  
Management
----------

  
Management of an acute anal fissure (\< 1 week)  
* soften stool
	+ dietary advice: high\-fibre diet with high fluid intake
	+ bulk\-forming laxatives are first\-line \- if not tolerated then lactulose should be tried
* lubricants such as petroleum jelly may be tried before defecation
* topical anaesthetics
* analgesia

  
Management of a chronic anal fissure  
* the above techniques should be continued
* topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) is first\-line treatment for a chronic anal fissure
* if topical GTN is not effective after 8 weeks then secondary care referral should be considered for surgery (sphincterotomy) or botulinum toxin
