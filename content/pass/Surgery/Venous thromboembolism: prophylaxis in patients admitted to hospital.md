VTEs can cause severe morbidity and mortality, but they are preventable. Current NICE guidelines (updated for 2018\) outline recommendations for assessment and management of patients at risk of VTE in hospital.   
  
  
Risk factors
------------

  
All patients admitted to hospital should be individually assessed to identify risk factors for VTE development and bleeding risk. For medical and surgical patients the recommended risk proforma is the department of healths VTE risk assessment tool.  
  
The following inpatients would be deemed at increased risk of developing a VTE:  
  
Medical patients:  
* significant reduction in mobility for 3 days or more (or anticipated to have significantly reduced mobility)

  
Surgical/trauma patients:  
* hip/knee replacement
* hip fracture
* general anaesthetic and a surgical duration of over 90 minutes
* surgery of the pelvis or lower limb with a general anaesthetic and a surgical duration of over 60 minutes
* acute surgical admission with an inflammatory/intra\-abdominal condition
* surgery with a significant reduction in mobility

  
General risk factors:  
* active cancer/chemotherapy
* aged over 60
* known blood clotting disorder (e.g. thrombophilia)
* BMI over 35
* dehydration
* one or more significant medical comorbidities (e.g. heart disease; metabolic/endocrine pathologies; respiratory disease; acute infectious disease and inflammatory conditions)
* critical care admission
* use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
* use of the combined oral contraceptive pill
* varicose veins
* pregnant or less than 6 weeks post\-partum

  
After a patients VTE risk has been assessed, this should be compared to their risk of bleeding to decide whether VTE prophylaxis should be offered. If indicated VTE prophylaxis should be started as soon as possible.   
  
  
Types of VTE prophylaxis
------------------------

  
Mechanical:  
* Correctly fitted anti\-embolism (aka compression) stockings (thigh or knee height)
* An Intermittent pneumatic compression device

  
Pharmacological:  
* Fondaparinux sodium (SC injection)
* Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
	+ e.g. enoxaparin
	+ reduced doses should be used in patients with severe renal impairment
* Unfractionated heparin (UFH)
	+ used as an alternative to LWMH in patients with chronic kidney disease

  
  
Management
----------

  
In general, all medical patients deemed at risk of VTE after individual assessment are started on pharmacological VTE prophylaxis. This is providing the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding (this is often a clinical judgement) and there are no contraindications. Those at very high risk may be offered anti\-embolic stockings alongside the pharmacological methods.   
  
For surgical patients at low risk of VTE first\-line treatment is anti\-embolism stockings. If a patient is at high risk these stockings are used in conjunction with pharmacological prophylaxis.   
  
  
Advice for patients
-------------------

  
Pre\-surgical interventions:  
* Advise women to stop taking their combined oral contraceptive pill/hormone replacement therapy 4 weeks before surgery

  
Post\-surgical interventions:   
* Try to mobilise patients as soon as possible after surgery
* Ensure the patient is hydrated

  
  
Post procedure prophylaxis
--------------------------

  
For certain surgical procedures (hip and knee replacements) pharmacological VTE prophylaxis is recommended for all patients to reduce the risk of a VTE developing post\-surgery. NICE make the following recommendations:  
  


| **Procedure** | **Prophylaxis** |
| --- | --- |
| Elective hip | LMWH for 10 days followed by aspirin (75 or 150 mg) for a further 28 daysorLMWH for 28 days combined with anti\-embolism stockings until dischargeorRivaroxaban |
| Elective knee | Aspirin (75 or 150 mg) for 14 daysorLMWH for 14 days combined with anti\-embolism stockings until dischargeorRivaroxaban |
| Fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip and proximal femur | The NICE guidance states the following (our bolding):*Offer VTE prophylaxis for a **month** to people with fragility fractures of the pelvis, hip or proximalfemur if the risk of VTE outweighs the risk of bleeding. Choose either:* LMWH , starting 6\-12 hours after surgery or * fondaparinux sodium, starting 6 hours after surgery, providing there is low risk of bleeding.* |
