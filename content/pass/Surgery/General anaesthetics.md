Inhaled anaesthetics
--------------------

  


| Drug | Mechanism of action | Adverse effects | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Volatile liquid anaesthetics(isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane) | Exact mechanism of action unknown. May act via a combination of GABAA, glycine and NDMA receptors | • Myocardial depression• Malignant hyperthermia• Halothane (not commonly used now) is hepatotoxic | Used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia |
| Nitrous oxide | Exact mechanism of action unknown. May act via a combination of NDMA, nACh, 5\-HT3, GABAA and glycine receptors | • May diffuse into gas\-filled body compartments → increase in pressure. Should therefore be avoided in certain conditions e.g. pneumothorax | Used for maintenance of anaesthesia and analgesia (e.g. during labour) |

  
Intravenous anaesthetics
------------------------

  


| Drug | Mechanism of action | Adverse effects | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Propofol | Potentiates GABAA | • Pain on injection (due to activation of the pain receptor TRPA1\)• Hypotension | • Very common induction agent for general anaesthesia and also used extensively in intensive care for ventilated patients• Has some anti\-emetic effects \- useful for patients with a high risk of post\-operative vomiting |
| Thiopental | A type of barbiturate (potentiates GABAA) | • Laryngospasm | • Highly lipid\-soluble so quickly affects the brain |
| Etomidate | Potentiates GABAA | • Primary adrenal suppression (secondary to reversibly inhibiting 11β\-hydroxylase)• Myoclonus | • Causes less hypotension than propofol and thiopental during induction and is therefore often used in cases of haemodynamic instability |
| Ketamine | Blocks NMDA receptors | • Disorientation• Hallucinations | • Acts as a dissociative anaesthetic.• Doesn't cause a drop in blood pressure so useful in trauma |
