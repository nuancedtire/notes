Elective and emergency patients require different preparation.  
  
**Elective cases**  
* Consider pre admission clinic to address medical issues.
* Blood tests including FBC, U\+E, LFTs, Clotting, Group and Save
* Urine analysis
* Pregnancy test
* Sickle cell test
* ECG/ Chest x\-ray

  
The exact tests to be performed will depend upon the proposed procedure and patient fitness.  
  
Risk factors for the development of deep vein thrombosis should be assessed and a plan for thromboprophylaxis formulated.  
  
  
Oral fluids/fasting
-------------------

  
Oral fluids:  
* patients having surgery may drink clear fluids until 2 hours before their operation
* drinking clear fluids before the operation can help reduce headaches, nausea and vomiting afterwards
* clear fluids are water, fruit juice without pulp, coffee or tea without milk and ice lollies

  
Patients are generally advised to fast from non\-clear liquids/food for at least 6 hours before surgery.  
  
  
Diabetes mellitus
-----------------

  
The management of diabetes during surgery is an important and relatively common problem. Whilst the BNF, NICE and the Joint British Diabetes Societies (JBDS) have produced guidelines many hospitals have their own protocols that should be followed where they exist. Management depends on a number of factors:  
* required duration of fasting
* timing of surgery (morning or afternoon)
* usual treatment regimen (insulin, antidiabetic drugs or diet)
* prior glycaemic control
* other co\-morbidities

  
Potential complications of poorly managed diabetes during surgery:  
 \- undetected hypoglycaemia whilst a patient is under a general anaesthetic. Diabetic patients have   
* increased risk of wound \& respiratory infections
* increased risk of post\-operative acute kidney injury
* increased length of hospital stay

  
### Patients taking oral antidiabetic drugs

  
Rules of thumb  
* patients treated with insulin who have good glycaemic control (HbA1c \< 69 mmol/mol) and are undergoing minor procedures, can be managed during the operative period by adjustment of their usual insulin regimen
* (surgery requiring a long fasting period of more than one missed meal) or whose diabetes is poorly controlled, will usually require a variable rate intravenous insulin infusion (VRIII)
* most patients taking only oral antidiabetic drugs may be managed by manipulating medication on the day of surgery, depending on the particular drug. There are some exceptions to this:
	+ if more than one meal is to be missed
	+ patients with poor glycaemic control
	+ risk of renal injury (e.g. low eGFR, contrast being used)
	+ in such cases a VRIII should be used

|  | Day prior to admission | Day of surgery (morning operation) | Day of surgery (afternoon operation) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Metformin\*** | Take as normal | If taken once or twice a day \- takeas normal If taken three times per day, omit lunchtime dose | If taken once ortwice a day \- take as normal If taken three times per day, omit lunchtime dose |

| **SGLT\-2 inhibitors (\-flozins)** | Take as normal | Omit on the day of surgery | Omit on the day of surgery |
| **Once daily insulins (e.g. Lantus, Levemir)** | Reduce doseby 20% | Reduce dose by 20% | Reduce dose by 20% |
| **Twice daily Biphasic or ultra\-long acting insulins (e.g. Novomix 30, Humulin M3\)** | No dosechange | Halve the usual morning dose. Leave evening dose unchanged | Halve the usual morning dose. Leave evening dose unchanged |

  
\*assumes only one meal will be missed during surgery, eGFR is greater than 60 ml/min/1\.73m2 and procedure not requiring the use of contrast

Emergency cases
---------------

  
Stabilise and resuscitate where needed.  
  
Consider whether antibiotics are needed and when and how they should be administered.  
Inform blood bank if major procedures planned particularly where coagulopathies are present at the outset or anticipated (e.g. Ruptured AAA repair)  
Don't forget to consent and inform relatives.  
  
  
Special preparation
-------------------

  
Some procedures require special preparation:  
* Thyroid surgery; vocal cord check.
* Parathyroid surgery; consider methylene blue to identify gland.
* Sentinel node biopsy; radioactive marker/ patent blue dye.
* Surgery involving the thoracic duct; consider administration of cream.
* Pheochromocytoma surgery; will need alpha and beta blockade.
* Surgery for carcinoid tumours; will need covering with octreotide.
* Colorectal cases; bowel preparation (especially left sided surgery)
* Thyrotoxicosis; lugols iodine/ medical therapy.
