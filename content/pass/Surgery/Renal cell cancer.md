Renal cell cancer is also known as hypernephroma and accounts for 85% of primary renal neoplasms. It arises from proximal renal tubular epithelium. The most common histological subtype is clear cell (75 to 85 percent of tumours).  
  
Associations  
* more common in middle\-aged men
* smoking
* von Hippel\-Lindau syndrome
* tuberous sclerosis
* incidence of renal cell cancer is only slightly increased in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease

  
Features  
* classical triad:
	+ haematuria
	+ loin pain
	+ abdominal mass
* pyrexia of unknown origin
* endocrine effects
	+ may secrete erythropoietin (polycythaemia)
	+ parathyroid hormone\-related protein (hypercalcaemia), renin
	+ ACTH
* 25% have metastases at presentation
* paraneoplastic hepatic dysfunction syndrome
* varicocele
	+ majority are left\-sided
	+ caused by the tumour compressing veins
* Stauffer syndrome
	+ a paraneoplastic disorder associated with renal cell cancer
	+ typically presents as cholestasis/hepatosplenomegaly
	+ it is thought to be secondary to increased levels of IL\-6

  


| T category | Criteria |
| --- | --- |
| T1 | Tumour â‰¤ 7 cm and confined to the kidney |
| T2 | Tumour \> 7 cm and confined to the kidney |
| T3 | Tumour extends into major veins or perinephric tissues, but not into the ipsilateral adrenal gland and not beyond Gerota's fascia |
| T4 | Tumor invades beyond Gerota's fascia (including contiguous extension into the ipsilateral adrenal gland) |

  
Management  
* for confined disease a partial or total nephrectomy depending on the tumour size
	+ patients with a T1 tumour (i.e. \< 7cm in size) are typically offered a partial nephrectomy
* alpha\-interferon and interleukin\-2 have been used to reduce tumour size and also treat patients with metatases
* receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. sorafenib, sunitinib) have been shown to have superior efficacy compared to interferon\-alpha
