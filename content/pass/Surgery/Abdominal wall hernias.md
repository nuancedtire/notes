The classical surgical definition of a hernia is the protrusion of an organ or the fascia of an organ through the wall of the cavity that normally contains it.  
  
Risk factors for abdominal wall hernias include:  
* obesity
* ascites
* increasing age
* surgical wounds

  
Features  
* palpable lump
* cough impulse
* pain
* obstruction: more common in femoral hernias
* strangulation: may compromise the bowel blood supply leading to infarction

  
Types of abdominal wall hernias:  
  


| **Type of hernia** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Inguinal hernia** | Inguinal hernias account for 75% of abdominal wall hernias. Around 95% of patients are male; men have around a 25% lifetime risk of developing an inguinal hernia.Above and medial to pubic tubercle Strangulation is rare |
| **Femoral hernia** | Below and lateral to the pubic tubercleMore common in women, particularly multiparous onesHigh risk of obstruction and strangulationSurgical repair is required |
| **Umbilical hernia** | Symmetrical bulge under the umbilicus |
| **Paraumbilical hernia** | Asymmetrical bulge \- half the sac is covered by skin of the abdomen directly above or below the umbilicus |
| **Epigastric hernia** | Lump in the midline between umbilicus and the xiphisternumRisk factors include extensive physical training or coughing (from lung diseases), obesity |
| **Incisional hernia** | May occur in up to 10% of abdominal operations |
| **Spigelian hernia** | Also known as lateral ventral herniaRare and seen in older patientsA hernia through the spigelian fascia (the aponeurotic layer between the rectus abdominis muscle medially and the semilunar line laterally) |
| **Obturator hernia** | A hernia which passes through the obturator foramen. More common in females and typical presents with bowel obstruction |
| **Richter hernia** | A rare type of hernia where only the antimesenteric border of the bowel herniates through the fascial defectRichter's hernia can present with strangulation without symptoms of obstruction |

  
Abdominal wall hernias in children:  
  


| **Type of hernia** | **Details** |
| --- | --- |
| **Congenital inguinal hernia** | Indirect hernias resulting from a patent processus vaginalisOccur in around 1% of term babies. More common in premature babies and boys60% are right sided, 10% are bilaterallyShould be surgically repaired soon after diagnosis as at risk of incarceration |
| **Infantile umbilical hernia** | Symmetrical bulge under the umbilicus More common in premature and Afro\-Caribbean babiesThe vast majority resolve without intervention before the age of 4\-5 yearsComplications are rare |
