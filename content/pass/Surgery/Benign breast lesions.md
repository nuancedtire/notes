| **Lesion** | **Features** | **Treatment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fibroadenoma | * Develop from a whole lobule * Mobile, firm breast lumps * 12% of all breast masses * Over a 2 year period up to 30% will get smaller * No increase in risk of malignancy | If \>3cm surgical excision is usual, Phyllodes tumours should be widely excised (mastectomy if the lesion is large) |
| Breast cyst | * 7% of all Western females will present with a breast cyst * Usually presents as a smooth discrete lump (may be fluctuant) * Small increased risk of breast cancer (especially if younger) | Cysts should be aspirated, those which are blood stained or persistently refill should be biopsied or excised |
| Sclerosing adenosis, (radial scars and complex sclerosing lesions) | * Usually presents as a breast lump or breast pain * Causes mammographic changes which may mimic carcinoma * Cause distortion of the distal lobular unit, without hyperplasia (complex lesions will show hyperplasia) * Considered a disorder of involution, no increase in malignancy risk | Lesions should be biopsied, excision is not mandatory |
| Epithelial hyperplasia | * Variable clinical presentation ranging from generalised lumpiness through to discrete lump * Disorder consists of increased cellularity of terminal lobular unit, atypical features may be present * Atypical features and family history of breast cancer confers greatly increased risk of malignancy | If no atypical features then conservative, those with atypical features require either close monitoring or surgical resection |
| Fat necrosis | * Up to 40% cases usually have a traumatic aetiology * Physical features usually mimic carcinoma * Mass may increase in size initially | Imaging and core biopsy |
| Duct papilloma | * Usually present with nipple discharge * Large papillomas may present with a mass * The discharge usually originates from a single duct * No increase risk of malignancy | Microdochectomy |
