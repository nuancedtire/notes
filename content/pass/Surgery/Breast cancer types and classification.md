The terminology surrounding breast cancer can sometimes be confusing and has changed over recent years. It is useful to start by considering basic breast anatomy

Basic breast anatomy  
Most breast cancers arise from duct tissue followed by lobular tissue, described as **ductal** or **lobular carcinoma** respectively. These can be further subdivided as to whether the cancer hasn't spread beyond the local tissue (described as **carcinoma\-in\-situ**) or has spread (described as **invasive**). Therefore, common breast cancer types include:  
* **Invasive ductal carcinoma**. This is the most common type of breast cancer. To complicate matters further this has recently been renamed '**No Special Type (NST)**'. In contrast, lobular carcinoma and other rarer types of breast cancer are classified as 'Special Type'
* **Invasive lobular carcinoma**
* **Ductal carcinoma\-in\-situ (DCIS)**
* **Lobular carcinoma\-in\-situ (LCIS)**

  
Rarer types of breast cancer are shown in the following list. These are classed as 'Special Type' but as noted previously remember that a relatively common type of breast cancer (lobular) is also Special Type:  
* Medullary breast cancer
* Mucinous (mucoid or colloid) breast cancer
* Tubular breast cancer
* Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the breast
* Metaplastic breast cancer
* Lymphoma of the breast
* Basal type breast cancer
* Phyllodes or cystosarcoma phyllodes
* Papillary breast cancer

  
Other types of breast cancer include the following (although please note they may be associated with the underlying lesions seen above, rather than completely separate subtypes):  
  
**Paget's disease of the nipple** is an eczematoid change of the nipple associated with an underlying breast malignancy and it is present in 1\-2% of patients with breast cancer. In half of these patients, it is associated with an underlying mass lesion and 90% of such patients will have an invasive carcinoma. 30% of patients without a mass lesion will still be found to have an underlying carcinoma. The remainder will have carcinoma in situ.   
  
**Inflammatory breast cancer** where cancerous cells block the lymph drainage resulting in an inflamed appearance of the breast. This accounts for around 1 in 10,000 cases of breast cancer.
