Acute pancreatitis is a serious condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. It is managed in a hospital setting.  
  
Acute pancreatitis may be stratified as follows:  
  


| Severity | Organ failure | Local complications |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mild | No | No |
| Moderately severe | No or transient (\<48 hours) | Possible |
| Severe | Persistent (\>48 hours) | Possible |

  
Key aspects of care  
* fluid resuscitation
	+ aggressive early hydration with crystalloids. In severe cases 3\-6 litres of third space fluid loss may occur
	+ aim for a urine output of \> 0\.5mls/kg/hr
	+ may also help relieve pain by reducing lactic acidosis
* analgesia
	+ pain may be severe so this is a key priority of care
	+ intravenous opioids are normally required to adequately control the pain
* nutrition
	+ patients should not routinely be made 'nil\-by\-mouth' unless there is a clear reason e.g. the patient is vomiting
	+ enteral nutrition should be offered to anyone with moderately severe or severe acute pancreatitis within 72 hours of presentation
	+ parental nutrition should only be used if enteral nurition has failed or is contraindicated
* role of antibiotics
	+ NICE state the following: '*Do not offer prophylactic antimicrobials to people with acute pancreatitis*'
	+ potential indications include infected pancreatic necrosis

  
Role of surgery  
* Patients with acute pancreatitis due to gallstones should undergo early cholecystectomy
* Patients with obstructed biliary system due to stones should undergo early ERCP
* Patients who fail to settle with necrosis and have worsening organ dysfunction may require debridement, fine needle aspiration is still used by some
* Patients with infected necrosis should undergo either radiological drainage or surgical necrosectomy. The choice of procedure depends upon local expertise
