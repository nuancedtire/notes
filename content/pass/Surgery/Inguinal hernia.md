Inguinal hernias account for 75% of abdominal wall hernias. Around 95% of patients are male; men have around a 25% lifetime risk of developing an inguinal hernia.  
  
Features  
* groin lump
	+ superior and medial to the pubic tubercle
	+ disappears on pressure or when the patient lies down
* discomfort and ache: often worse with activity, severe pain is uncommon
* strangulation is rare

  
Whilst traditional textbooks describe the anatomical differences between indirect (hernia through the inguinal canal) and direct hernias (through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal) this is of no relevance to the clinical management.  
  
Management  
* the clinical consensus is currently to treat medically fit patients even if they are asymptomatic
* a hernia truss may be an option for patients not fit for surgery but probably has little role in other patients
* mesh repair is associated with the lowest recurrence rate
	+ unilateral inguinal hernias are generally repaired with an open approach
	+ bilateral and recurrent inguinal hernias are generally repaired laparoscopically

  
The Department for Work and Pensions recommend that following an open repair patients return to non\-manual work after 2\-3 weeks and following laparoscopic repair after 1\-2 weeks  
  
Complications  
* early: bruising, wound infection
* late: chronic pain, recurrence
