Three main patterns of presentation may be seen in patients with peripheral arterial disease:  
* intermittent claudication
* critical limb ischaemia
* acute limb\-threatening ischaemia

  
Intermittent claudication
-------------------------

  
Features  
* intermittent claudication: aching or burning in the leg muscles following walking
* patients can typically walk for a predictable distance before the symptoms start
* usually relieved within minutes of stopping
* not present at rest

  
Assessment  
* check the femoral, popliteal, posterior tibialis and dorsalis pedis pulses
* check ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI)
* duplex ultrasound is the first line investigation
* magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) should be performed prior to any intervention

  
Interpretation of ABPI  
  


| Result | Usual clinical correlation |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Normal |
| 0\.6\-0\.9 | Claudication |
| 0\.3\-0\.6 | Rest pain |
| \<0\.3 | Impending |
