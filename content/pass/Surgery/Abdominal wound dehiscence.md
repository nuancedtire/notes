Abdominal wound dehiscence is a significant problem facing all surgeons who undertake abdominal surgery on a regular basis. Traditionally, it is said to occur when all layers of an abdominal mass closure fail and the viscera protrude externally (associated with 30% mortality).   
  
It can be subdivided into **superficial**, in which the skin wound alone fails and **complete**, implying failure of all layers.  
  
Factors that increase the risk are:  
* Malnutrition
* Vitamin deficiencies
* Jaundice
* Steroid use
* Major wound contamination (e.g. faecal peritonitis)
* Poor surgical technique (Mass closure technique is the preferred method\-Jenkins Rule)

  
When sudden full dehiscence occurs the management is as follows:  
* Coverage of the wound with saline impregnated gauze (on the ward)
* IV broad\-spectrum antibiotics
* Analgesia
* IV fluids
* Arrangements made for a return to theatre
