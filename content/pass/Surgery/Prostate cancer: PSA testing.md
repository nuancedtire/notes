Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a serine protease enzyme produced by normal and malignant prostate epithelial cells. It has become an important tumour marker but much controversy still exists regarding its usefulness as a screening tool.   
  
PSA testing should be:  
* considered in men with suspected prostate cancer
* offered to men older than 50 years of age who request a PSA test

  
Age\-specific PSA thresholds for people with possible symptoms of prostate cancer are shown below. Patients who have a PSA above this level should be referred on the suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) if their PSA level is above the threshold for their age.  
  


| **Age** | **PSA level (ng/ml)** |
| --- | --- |
| \< 40 | Use clinical judgement |
| 40–49 | \> 2\.5 |
| 50–59 | \> 3\.5 |
| 60–69 | \> 4\.5 |
| 70–79 | \> 6\.5 |
| \> 79 | Use clinical judgement |

  
PSA levels may also be raised by:  
* benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)
* prostatitis and urinary tract infection (NICE recommend to postpone the PSA test for at least 6 weeks after treatment)
* ejaculation (ideally not in the previous 48 hours)
* vigorous exercise (ideally not in the previous 48 hours)
* urinary retention
* instrumentation of the urinary tract

  
Poor specificity and sensitivity  
* around 33% of men with a PSA of 4\-10 ng/ml will be found to have prostate cancer. With a PSA of 10\-20 ng/ml this rises to 60% of men
* around 15% with prostate cancer have a normal PSA
* various methods are used to try and add greater meaning to a PSA level including age\-adjusted upper limits and monitoring change in PSA level with time (PSA velocity or PSA doubling time)
