Acute appendicitis is the most common acute abdominal condition requiring surgery. It can occur at any age but is most common in young people aged 10\-20 years.  
  
Pathogenesis  
* lymphoid hyperplasia or a faecolith → obstruction of appendiceal lumen → gut organisms invading the appendix wall → oedema, ischaemia \+/\- perforation

  
Abdominal pain is seen in the vast majority of patients:  
* peri\-umbilical abdominal pain (visceral stretching of appendix lumen and appendix is midgut structure) radiating to the right iliac fossa (RIF) due to localised parietal peritoneal inflammation.
* the migration of the pain from the centre to the RIF has been shown to be one of the strongest indicators of appendicitis
* patients often report the pain being worse on coughing or going over speed bumps. Children typically can't hop on the right leg due to the pain.

  
Other features:  
* vomit once or twice but marked and persistent vomiting is unusual
* diarrhoea is rare. However, pelvic appendicitis may cause localised rectal irritation of some loose stools. A pelvic abscess may also cause diarrhoea
* mild pyrexia is common \- temperature is usually 37\.5\-38oC. Higher temperatures are more typical of conditions like mesenteric adenitis
* anorexia is very common. It is very unusual for patients with appendicitis to be hungry
* around 50% of patients have the typical symptoms of anorexia, peri\-umbilical pain and nausea followed by more localised right lower quadrant pain

  
Examination  
* generalised peritonitis if perforation has occurred or localised peritonism
	+ rebound and percussion tenderness, guarding and rigidity
* retrocaecal appendicitis may have relatively few signs
* digital rectal examination may reveal boggy sensation if pelvic abscess is present, or even right\-sided tenderness with a pelvic appendix
* classical signs
	+ Rovsing's sign (palpation in the LIF causes pain in the RIF) is now thought to be of limited value
	+ psoas sign: pain on extending hip if retrocaecal appendix

  
Diagnosis  
* typically raised inflammatory markers coupled with compatible history and examination findings should be enough to justify appendicectomy
* a neutrophil\-predominant leucocytosis is seen in 80\-90%
* urine analysis: useful to exclude pregnancy in women, renal colic and urinary tract infection. In patients with appendicitis, urinalysis may show mild leucocytosis but no nitrites
* there are no definite rules on the use of imaging and its use is often determined by the patient's gender, age, body habitus and the likelihood of appendicitis
	+ thin, male patients with a high likelihood of appendicitis may be diagnosed clinically
	+ ultrasound is useful in females where pelvic organ pathology is suspected. Although it is not always possible to visualise the appendix on ultrasound, the presence of free fluid (always pathological in males) should raise suspicion
	+ CT scans are widely used in patients with suspected appendicitis in the US but this practice has not currently reached the UK, due to the concerns regarding excessive ionising radiation and resource limitations

  
Management  
* appendicectomy
	+ can be performed via either an open or laparoscopic approach
	+ laparoscopic appendicectomy is now the treatment of choice
* administration of prophylactic intravenous antibiotics reduces wound infection rates
* patients with perforated appendicitis (typical around 15\-20%) require copious abdominal lavage.
* patients without peritonitis who have an appendix mass should receive broad\-spectrum antibiotics and consideration given to performing an interval appendicectomy
* be wary in the older patients who may have either an underlying caecal malignancy or perforated sigmoid diverticular disease.
* trials have looked at the use of intravenous antibiotics alone in the treatment of appendicitis. The evidence currently suggests that whilst this is successful in the majority of patients, it is associated with a longer hospital stay and up to 20% of patients go on to have an appendicectomy within 12 months.
