A hiatus hernia describes the herniation of part of the stomach above the diaphragm.  
  
There are two types:  
* sliding: accounts for 95% of hiatus hernias, the gastroesophageal junction moves above the diaphragm
* rolling (paraoesophageal): the gastroesophageal junctions remains below the diaphragm but a separate part of the stomach herniates through the oesophageal hiatus

  
Risk factors  
* obesity
* increased intraabdominal pressure (e.g. ascites, multiparity)

  
Features  
* heartburn
* dysphagia
* regurgitation
* chest pain

  
Investigation  
* barium swallow is the most sensitive test
* given the nature of the symptoms many patients have an endoscopy first\-line, with a hiatus hernia being found incidentally

  
Management  
* all patients benefit from conservative management e.g. weight loss
* medical management: proton pump inhibitor therapy
* surgical management: only really has a role in symptomatic paraesophageal hernias
