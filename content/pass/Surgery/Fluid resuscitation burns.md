Indication: \>15% total body area burns in adults (\>10% children)  
* The main aim of resuscitation is to prevent the burn deepening
* Most fluid is lost 24h after injury
* First 8\-12h fluid shifts from intravascular to interstitial fluid compartments
* Therefore circulatory volume can be compromised. However fluid resuscitation causes more fluid into the interstitial compartment especially colloid (therefore avoided in first 8\-24h)
* Protein loss occurs

  
**Fluid resuscitation formula**  
  


| **Parkland formula** (Crystalloid only e.g. Hartman's solution/Ringers' lactate) |
| --- |
| **Total fluid requirement in 24 hours \= 4 ml x (total burn surface area (%)) x (body weight (kg))*** 50% given in first 8 hours * 50% given in next 16 hours |
| **Resuscitation endpoint**:Urine output of 0\.5\-1\.0 ml/kg/hour in adults (increase rate of fluid to achieve this) |
| **Points to note**:* Starting point of resuscitation is time of injury * Deduct fluids already given |

  
After 24 hours  
* Colloid infusion is begun at a rate of 0\.5 ml x(total burn surface area (%))x(body weight (kg))
* Maintenance crystalloid (usually dextrose\-saline) is continued at a rate of 1\.5 ml x(burn area)x(body weight)
* Colloids used include albumin and FFP
* Antioxidants, such as vitamin C, can be used to minimize oxidant\-mediated contributions to the inflammatory cascade in burns
* High tension electrical injuries and inhalation injuries require more fluid
* Monitor: packed cell volume, plasma sodium, base excess, and lactate
