Patients who suffer head injuries should be managed according to ATLS principles and extracranial injuries should be managed alongside cranial trauma. An inadequate cardiac output will compromise CNS perfusion irrespective of the nature of the cranial injury.   
  
Types of traumatic brain injury
-------------------------------

  


| **Extradural haematoma** | Bleeding into the space between the dura mater and the skull. Often results from acceleration\-deceleration trauma or a blow to the side of the head. The majority of extradural haematomas occur in the temporal region where skull fractures cause a rupture of the middle meningeal artery.Features* Raised intracranial pressure * Some patients may exhibit a lucid interval |
| --- | --- |
| **Subdural haematoma** | Bleeding into the outermost meningeal layer. Most commonly occur around the frontal and parietal lobes. May be either acute or chronic. Risk factors include old age and alcoholism.Slower onset of symptoms than a extradural haematoma. |
| **Subarachnoid haemorrhage** | Usually occurs spontaneously in the context of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, but may be seen in association with other injuries when a patient has sustained a traumatic brain injury. |

  
**Pathophysiology**  
* Primary brain injury may be focal (contusion/ haematoma) or diffuse (diffuse axonal injury)
* Diffuse axonal injury occurs as a result of mechanical shearing following deceleration, causing disruption and tearing of axons
* Intra\-cranial haematomas can be extradural, subdural or intracerebral, while contusions may occur adjacent to (coup) or contralateral (contre\-coup) to the side of impact
* Secondary brain injury occurs when cerebral oedema, ischaemia, infection, tonsillar or tentorial herniation exacerbates the original injury. The normal cerebral auto regulatory processes are disrupted following trauma rendering the brain more susceptible to blood flow changes and hypoxia
* The Cushings reflex (hypertension and bradycardia) often occurs late and is usually a pre terminal event

  
**Management**  
* Where there is life threatening rising ICP such as in extradural haematoma and whilst theatre is prepared or transfer arranged use of IV mannitol/ frusemide may be required.
* Diffuse cerebral oedema may require decompressive craniotomy
* Exploratory Burr Holes have little management in modern practice except where scanning may be unavailable and to thus facilitate creation of formal craniotomy flap
* Depressed skull fractures that are open require formal surgical reduction and debridement, closed injuries may be managed nonoperatively if there is minimal displacement.
* ICP monitoring is appropriate in those who have GCS 3\-8 and normal CT scan.
* ICP monitoring is mandatory in those who have GCS 3\-8 and abnormal CT scan.
* Hyponatraemia is most likely to be due to the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion.
* Minimum of cerebral perfusion pressure of 70mmHg in adults.
* Minimum cerebral perfusion pressure of between 40 and 70 mmHg in children.

  
Interpretation of pupillary findings in head injuries
-----------------------------------------------------

  


| **Pupil size** | **Light response** | **Interpretation** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unilaterally dilated | Sluggish or fixed | 3rd nerve compression secondary to tentorial herniation |
| Bilaterally dilated | Sluggish or fixed | * Poor CNS perfusion * Bilateral 3rd nerve palsy |
| Unilaterally dilated or equal | Cross reactive (Marcus \- Gunn) | Optic nerve injury |
| Bilaterally constricted | May be difficult to assess | * Opiates * Pontine lesions * Metabolic encephalopathy |
| Unilaterally constricted | Preserved | Sympathetic pathway disruption |
