Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur primarily as a result of the failure of elastic proteins within the extracellular matrix. Aneurysms typically represent dilation of all layers of the arterial wall. Most aneurysms are caused by degenerative disease. After the age of 50 years the normal diameter of the infrarenal aorta is 1\.5cm in females and 1\.7cm in males. Diameters of 3cm and greater, are considered aneurysmal. The pathophysiology involved in the development of aneurysms is complex and the primary event is loss of the intima with loss of elastic fibres from the media. This process is associated with, and potentiated by, increased proteolytic activity and lymphocytic infiltration.   
  
Major risk factors for the development of aneurysms include smoking and hypertension. Rare but important causes include syphilis and connective tissues diseases such as Ehlers Danlos type 1 and Marfan's syndrome.
