Priapism is a persistent penile erection, typically defined as lasting longer than 4 hours and is not associated with sexual stimulation. Priapism can be described as either ischaemic or non\-ischaemic with both categories having a different pathophysiology. Ischaemic priapism is typically due to impaired vasorelaxation and therefore reduced vascular outflow resulting in congestion and trapping of de\-oxygenated blood within the corpus cavernosa. Non\-ischaemic priapism is due to high arterial inflow, typically due to fistula formation often either as the result of congenital or traumatic mechanisms.  
  
Epidemiology  
* Age at presentation has a bimodal distribution, with peaks between 5\-10 years and 20\-50 years of age
* incidence has been estimated at up to 5\.34 per 100,000 patient\-years

  
Causes  
* Idiopathic
* Sickle cell disease or other haemoglobinopathies
* Erectile dysfunction medication (e.g. Sildenafil and other PDE\-5 inhibitors), this also includes intracavernosal injected therapies.
* Other drugs both prescribed (anti\-hypertensives, anticoagulants, antidepressants etc) and recreational (specifically cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy).
* Trauma

  
Patients typically present acutely with:  
* A persistent erection lasting over 4 hours
* Pain localised to the penis
* Often a history of either known haemoglobinopathy or use of medications listed above
* Patients may, more rarely, present with either a non\-painful erection or an erection that is not fully rigid: these are both suggestive of non\-ischaemic priapism.
* History of trauma to the genital or perineal region: also suggestive of non\-ischaemic priapism.

  
  
Investigations:  
* Cavernosal blood gas analysis to differentiate between ischaemic and non\-ischaemic: *in ischaemic priapism pO2 and pH would be reduced whilst pCO2 would be increased.*
* Doppler or duplex ultrasonography: this can be used as an alternative to blood gas analysis to assess for blood flow within the penis.
* A full blood count and toxicology screen can be used to assess for an underlying cause of the priapism.
* Diagnosis of priapism is largely clinical, with investigations helping to categorise into ischaemic and non\-ischaemic as well as assessing for the underlying cause.

  
Management
----------

  
Ischaemic priapism is a medical emergency and delayed treatment can lead to permanent tissue damage and long\-term erectile dysfunction.   
* If the priapism has lasted longer than 4 hours, the first\-line treatment is aspiration of blood from the cavernosa, this is often combined with injection of a saline flush to help clear viscous blood that has pooled.
* If aspiration and injection fails, then intracavernosal injection of a vasoconstrictive agent such as phenylephrine is used and repeated at 5 minute intervals.
* If medical therapy fails then surgical options can be considered.

  
Non\-ischaemic priapism is not a medical emergency and is normally suitable for observation as a first\-line option.
