Chronic pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition which can ultimately affect both the exocrine and endocrine functions of the pancreas. Around 80% of cases are due to alcohol excess with up to 20% of cases being unexplained.  
  
Other than alcohol, causes include:  
* genetic: cystic fibrosis, haemochromatosis
* ductal obstruction: tumours, stones, structural abnormalities including pancreas divisum and annular pancreas

  
Features  
* pain is typically worse 15 to 30 minutes following a meal
* steatorrhoea: symptoms of pancreatic insufficiency usually develop between 5 and 25 years after the onset of pain
* diabetes mellitus develops in the majority of patients. It typically occurs more than 20 years after symptom begin

  
Investigation  
* abdominal x\-ray shows pancreatic calcification in 30% of cases
* CT is more sensitive at detecting pancreatic calcification. Sensitivity is 80%, specificity is 85%
* functional tests: faecal elastase may be used to assess exocrine function if imaging inconclusive

Management  
* pancreatic enzyme supplements
* analgesia
* antioxidants: limited evidence base \- one study suggests benefit in early disease
