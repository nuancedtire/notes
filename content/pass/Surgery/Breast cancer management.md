The management of breast cancer depends on the staging, tumour type and patient background. It may involve any of the following:  
* surgery
* radiotherapy
* hormone therapy
* biological therapy
* chemotherapy

  
Surgery
-------

  
The vast majority of patients who have breast cancer diagnosed will be offered surgery. An exception may be a very frail, elderly lady with metastatic disease who may be better managed with hormonal therapy.  
  
Prior to surgery, the presence/absence of axillary lymphadenopathy determines management:  
* women with no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy at presentation should have a pre\-operative axillary ultrasound before their primary surgery
	+ if negative then they should have a sentinel node biopsy to assess the nodal burden
* in patients with breast cancer who present with clinically palpable lymphadenopathy, axillary node clearance is indicated at primary surgery
	+ this may lead to arm lymphedema and functional arm impairment

  
Depending on the characteristics of the tumour women either have a wide\-local excision or a mastectomy. Around two\-thirds of tumours can be removed with a wide\-local excision. The table below lists some of the factors determining which operation is offered:  
  


| **Mastectomy** | **Wide Local Excision** |
| --- | --- |
| Multifocal tumour | Solitary lesion |
| Central tumour | Peripheral tumour |
| Large lesion in small breast | Small lesion in large breast |
| DCIS \> 4cm | DCIS \< 4cm |

  
Women should be offered breast reconstruction to achieve a cosmetically suitable result regardless of the type of operation they have. For women who've had a mastectomy this may be done at the initial operation or at a later date.  
  
Radiotherapy
------------

  
Whole breast radiotherapy is recommended after a woman has had a wide\-local excision as this may reduce the risk of recurrence by around two\-thirds. For women who've had a mastectomy radiotherapy is offered for T3\-T4 tumours and for those with four or more positive axillary nodes  
  
Hormonal therapy
----------------

  
Adjuvant hormonal therapy is offered if tumours are positive for hormone receptors. For many years this was done using tamoxifen for 5 years after diagnosis. Tamoxifen is still used in pre\- and peri\-menopausal women. In post\-menopausal women, aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole are used for this purpose\*. This is important as aromatisation accounts for the majority of oestrogen production in post\-menopausal women and therefore anastrozole is used for ER \+ve breast cancer in this group.   
  
Important side effects of tamoxifen include an increased risk of endometrial cancer, venous thromboembolism and menopausal symptoms.  
  
Biological therapy
------------------

  
The most common type of biological therapy used for breast cancer is trastuzumab (Herceptin). It is only useful in the 20\-25% of tumours that are HER2 positive.  
  
Trastuzumab cannot be used in patients with a history of heart disorders.  
  
Chemotherapy
------------

  
Cytotoxic therapy may be used either prior to surgery ('neoadjuvanant' chemotherapy) to downstage a primary lesion or after surgery depending on the stage of the tumour, for example, if there is axillary node disease \- FEC\-D is used in this situation.
