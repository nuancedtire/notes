| **Suxamethonium** | * Depolarising neuromuscular blocker * Inhibits action of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction * Degraded by plasma cholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase * Fastest onset and shortest duration of action of all muscle relaxants * Produces generalised muscular contraction prior to paralysis * Adverse effects include hyperkalaemia, malignant hyperthermia and lack of acetylcholinesterase |
| --- | --- |
| **Atracurium** | * Non depolarising neuromuscular blocking drug * Duration of action usually 30\-45 minutes * Generalised histamine release on administration may produce facial flushing, tachycardia and hypotension * Not excreted by liver or kidney, broken down in tissues by hydrolysis * Reversed by neostigmine |
| **Vecuronium** | * Non depolarising neuromuscular blocking drug * Duration of action approximately 30 \- 40 minutes * Degraded by liver and kidney and effects prolonged in organ dysfunction * Effects may be reversed by neostigmine |
| **Pancuronium** | * Non depolarising neuromuscular blocker * Onset of action approximately 2\-3 minutes * Duration of action up to 2 hours * Effects may be partially reversed with drugs such as neostigmine |
