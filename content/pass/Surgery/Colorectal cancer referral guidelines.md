NICE updated their referral guidelines in 2023 to make increased use of Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) testing, instead of always doing a colonoscopy first\-line.  
  
NICE recommend a FIT is used to guide referral in the following scenarios:  
* with an abdominal mass, or
* with a change in bowel habit, or
* with iron\-deficiency anaemia, or
* aged 40 and over with unexplained weight loss and abdominal pain, or
* aged under 50 with rectal bleeding and either of the following unexplained symptoms:
	+ abdominal pain
	+ weight loss, or
* aged 50 and over with any of the following unexplained symptoms:
	+ rectal bleeding
	+ abdominal pain
	+ weight loss, or
* aged 60 and over with anaemia even in the absence of iron deficiency

  
Important points  
* FIT testing should be offered even if the person has previously had a negative FIT result through the NHS bowel cancer screening programme.
* people with a rectal mass, an unexplained anal mass or unexplained anal ulceration do not need to be offered FIT before referral is considered.

  
Results of FIT test:  
* positive: the patient should be referred on the suspected cancer pathway referral
* negative:
	+ safety netting
	+ NICE recommend referring on suspected cancer pathway if ongoing significant concern (e.g. abdominal mass)
	+ whilst not mentioned specifically in the guidance, it is clearly important to continue to investigate the symptoms and reach a definitive diagnosis

  
NHS screening
-------------

  
The NHS has a national screening programme offering screening every 2 years to all men and women aged 60 to 74 years in England, 50 to 74 years in Scotland. Patients aged over 74 years may request screening  
* eligible patients are sent Faecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) tests through the post
* a type of faecal occult blood (FOB) test which uses antibodies that specifically recognise human haemoglobin (Hb)
* used to detect, and can quantify, the amount of human blood in a single stool sample
* patients with abnormal results are offered a colonoscopy

  
The **FIT test is also recommended for patients with new symptoms who do not meet the 2\-week criteria** listed above, for example:  
* patients \>\= 50 years with unexplained abdominal pain **OR** weight loss
* patients \< 60 years with changes in their bowel habit **OR** iron deficiency anaemia
* patients \>\= 60 years who have anaemia even in the absence of iron deficiency
