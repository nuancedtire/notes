A variety of different procedures carry the risk of iatrogenic nerve injury. These are important not only from the patient's perspective but also from a medicolegal standpoint.  
  
The following operations and their associated nerve lesions are listed here:  
* Posterior triangle lymph node biopsy and accessory nerve lesion
* Lloyd Davies stirrups and common peroneal nerve
* Thyroidectomy and laryngeal nerve
* Anterior resection of rectum and hypogastric autonomic nerves
* Axillary node clearance; long thoracic nerve, thoracodorsal nerve and intercostobrachial nerve
* Inguinal hernia surgery and ilioinguinal nerve
* Varicose vein surgery\- sural and saphenous nerves
* Posterior approach to the hip and sciatic nerve
* Carotid endarterectomy and hypoglossal nerve

  
There are many more, with sound anatomical understanding of the commonly performed procedures the incidence of nerve lesions can be minimised. They commonly occur when surgeons operate in an unfamiliar tissue plane or by blind placement of haemostats (not recommended).
