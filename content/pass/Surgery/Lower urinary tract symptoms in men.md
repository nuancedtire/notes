Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men are very common and are present in the majority of men aged \> 50 years. They are most commonly secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia but other causes should be considered including prostate cancer.  
  
It is useful to classify the symptoms into 3 broad groups.  
  


| Voiding | Storage | Post\-micturition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| HesitancyPoor or intermittent streamStrainingIncomplete emptyingTerminal dribbling | UrgencyFrequencyNocturiaUrinary incontinence | Post\-micturition dribblingSensation of incomplete emptying |

   
  
Examination  
* urinalysis: exclude infection, check for haematuria
* digital rectal examination: size and consistency of prostate
* a PSA test may be indicated, but the patient should be properly counselled first

  
It is useful to get the patient to complete the following to guide management:  
* urinary frequency\-volume chart: distinguish between urinary frequency, polyuria, nocturia, and nocturnal polyuria.
* International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS): assess the impact on the patient's life. This classifies the symptoms as mild, moderate or severe

  
Management
----------

  
Predominately voiding symptoms  
* conservative measures include: pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, prudent fluid intake and containment products
* if 'moderate' or 'severe' symptoms offer an alpha\-blocker
* if the prostate is enlarged and the patient is 'considered at high risk of progression' then a 5\-alpha reductase inhibitor should be offered
* if the patient has an enlarged prostate and 'moderate' or 'severe' symptoms offer both an alpha\-blocker and 5\-alpha reductase inhibitor
* if there are mixed symptoms of voiding and storage not responding to an alpha blocker then a antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) drug may be added

  
Predominately overactive bladder  
* conservative measures include moderating fluid intake
* bladder retraining should be offered
* antimuscarinic drugs should be offered if symptoms persist. NICE recommend oxybutynin (immediate release), tolterodine (immediate release), or darifenacin (once daily preparation)
* mirabegron may be considered if first\-line drugs fail

  
Nocturia  
* advise about moderating fluid intake at night
* furosemide 40mg in late afternoon may be considered
* desmopressin may also be helpful
