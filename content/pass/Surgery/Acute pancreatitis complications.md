**Local complications**  
  
Peripancreatic fluid collections  
* Occur in 25% cases
* Located in or near the pancreas and lack a wall of granulation or fibrous tissue
* May resolve or develop into pseudocysts or abscesses
* Since most resolve aspiration and drainage is best avoided as it may precipitate infection

  
Pseudocysts  
* In acute pancreatitis result from organisation of peripancreatic fluid collection. They may or may not communicate with the ductal system.
* The collection is walled by fibrous or granulation tissue and typically occurs 4 weeks or more after an attack of acute pancreatitis
* Most are retrogastric
* 75% are associated with persistent mild elevation of amylase
* Investigation is with CT, ERCP and MRI or endoscopic USS
* Symptomatic cases may be observed for 12 weeks as up to 50% resolve
* Treatment is either with endoscopic or surgical cystogastrostomy or aspiration

  
Pancreatic necrosis  
* Pancreatic necrosis may involve both the pancreatic parenchyma and surrounding fat
* Complications are directly linked to extent of parenchymal necrosis and extent of necrosis overall
* Early necrosectomy is associated with a high mortality rate (and should be avoided unless compelling indications for surgery exist)
* Sterile necrosis should be managed conservatively (at least initially)
* Some centres will perform fine\-needle aspiration sampling of necrotic tissue if infection is suspected. False negatives may occur and the extent of sepsis and organ dysfunction may be a better guide to surgery

  
Pancreatic abscess  
* Intraabdominal collection of pus associated with pancreas but in the absence of necrosis
* Typically occur as a result of infected pseudocyst
* Transgastric drainage is one method of treatment, endoscopic drainage is an alternative

  
Haemorrhage  
* Infected necrosis may involve vascular structures with resultant haemorrhage that may occur de novo or as a result of surgical necrosectomy.
* When retroperitoneal haemorrhage occurs Grey Turner's sign may be identified

  
  
Systemic complications
----------------------

  
Acute respiratory distress syndrome  
* associated with a high\-mortality rate of around 20%
