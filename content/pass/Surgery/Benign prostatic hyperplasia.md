Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common condition seen in older men.   
  
Risk factors  
* age
	+ around 50% of 50\-year\-old men will have evidence of BPH and 30% will have symptoms
	+ around 80% of 80\-year\-old men have evidence of BPH
* ethnicity: black \> white \> Asian

  
BPH typically presents with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), which may be categorised into:  
* voiding symptoms (obstructive):
	+ weak or intermittent urinary flow
	+ straining
	+ hesitancy
	+ terminal dribbling
	+ incomplete emptying
* storage symptoms (irritative)
	+ urgency
	+ frequency
	+ urgency incontinence
	+ nocturia
* post\-micturition
	+ dribbling
* complications
	+ urinary tract infection
	+ retention
	+ obstructive uropathy

  
Assessment  
* dipstick urine
* U\&Es: particularly if chronic retention is suspected
* PSA: should be done if there are any obstructive symptoms, of if the patient is worried about prostate cancer
* urinary frequency\-volume chart
	+ should be done for at least 3 days
* International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)
	+ tool for classifying the severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and assessing the impact of LUTS on quality of life
	+ Score 20\-35: severely symptomatic
	+ Score 8\-19: moderately symptomatic
	+ Score 0\-7: mildly symptomatic

  
Management options  
* watchful waiting
* alpha\-1 antagonists e.g. tamsulosin, alfuzosin
	+ decrease smooth muscle tone of the prostate and bladder
	+ considered first\-line: NICE recommend if moderate\-to\-severe voiding symptoms (IPSS â‰¥ 8\)
	+ improve symptoms in around 70% of men
	+ adverse effects: dizziness, postural hypotension, dry mouth, depression
* 5 alpha\-reductase inhibitors e.g. finasteride
	+ block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is known to induce BPH
	+ indicated if the patient has a significantly enlarged prostate and is considered to be at high risk of progression
	+ unlike alpha\-1 antagonists causes a reduction in prostate volume and hence may slow disease progression. This however takes time and symptoms may not improve for 6 months
	+ may also decrease PSA concentrations by up to 50%
	+ adverse effects: erectile dysfunction, reduced libido, ejaculation problems, gynaecomastia
* the use of combination therapy (alpha\-1 antagonist \+ 5 alpha\-reductase inhibitor) was supported by the Medical Therapy Of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) trial and is also supported by NICE: '*If the man has bothersome moderate\-to\-severe voiding symptoms and prostatic enlargement*'
* if there is a mixture of storage symptoms and voiding symptoms that persist after treatment with an alpha\-blocker alone, then an antimuscarinic (anticholinergic) drug such as tolterodine or darifenacin may be tried
* surgery
	+ transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)
