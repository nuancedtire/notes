Femoral hernias occur when a section of the bowel or any other part of the abdominal viscera pass into the femoral canal. The canal is usually a densely packed area of the anterior thigh, however, it is a potential space that can become occupied by herniated contents via the **femoral ring**.  
  
Features:  
* A lump within the groin, that is usually mildly painful;
* It is important to distinguish femoral hernias, which are **inferolateral** to the pubic tubercle, from inguinal hernias which are **supermedial** to the pubic tubercle;
* Typically non\-reducible, although can be reducible in a minority of cases;
* Given the small size of the femoral ring, a cough impulse is often absent.

  
Epidemiology  
* Much less common than inguinal hernias (only 5% of abdominal hernias are femoral)
* More common in women (M:F 1:3\)
	+ The effects of increased abdominal pressure in pregnancy measn that femoral hernias are more common in multiparous women compared to nulliparous women.

  
Diagnosis is usually clinical, although ultrasound is an option. As with any lump, wherever it may be located, there are important differentials to exclude for femoral hernias:  
* Lymphadenopathy
* Abscess
* Femoral artery aneurysm
* Hydrocoele or varicocele in males
* Lipoma
* Inguinal hernia

  
Complications  
* Incarceration, where the herniated tissue cannot be reduced
* Strangulation
	+ Can follow on from incarceration, and is a **surgical emergency** that requires urgent management (see below)
	+ These hernias will be tender and likely non\-reducible, and may also present with a systemically unwell patient
	+ The risk of strangulation is much higher with femoral hernias than inguinal hernias and increases as the time from diagnosis rises;
* Bowel obstruction, again a **surgical emergency**
* Bowel ischaemia and resection due to the above, which may lead to significant morbidity and mortality for the patient.

  
Management  
* Surgical repair is a **necessity**, given the risk of strangulation, and can be carried out either laparoscopically or via a laparotomy
* Hernia support belts/trusses should not be used for femoral hernias, again due to the risk of strangulation;
* In an emergency situation, a laparotomy may be the only option
