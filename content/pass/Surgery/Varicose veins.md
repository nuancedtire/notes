Varicose veins are dilated, tortuous, superficial veins that occur secondary to incompetent venous valves, allowing blood to flow back, away from the heart. They most commonly occur in the legs due to reflux in the great saphenous vein and small saphenous vein. Whilst extremely common, the vast majority of patients do not require any intervention.  
  
Risk factors  
* increasing age
* female gender
* pregnancy
	+ the uterus causes compression of the pelvic veins
* obesity

  
For many patients, the cosmetic appearance may prompt presentation. However other patients may complain of symptoms:  
* aching, throbbing
* itching

  
Other patients may present with complications of varicose veins:  
* a variety of skin changes may be seen:
	+ varicose eczema (also known as venous stasis)
	+ haemosiderin deposition → hyperpigmentation
	+ lipodermatosclerosis → hard/tight skin
	+ atrophie blanche → hypopigmentation
* bleeding
* superficial thrombophlebitis
* venous ulceration
* deep vein thrombosis

Investigation  
* venous duplex ultrasound: this will demonstrate retrograde venous flow

  
Management  
* the majority of patients with varicose veins do not require surgery. Conservative treatments include:
	+ leg elevation
	+ weight loss
	+ regular exercise
	+ graduated compression stockings
* reasons for referral to secondary care include:
	+ significant/troublesome lower limb symptoms e.g. pain, discomfort or swelling
	+ previous bleeding from varicose veins
	+ skin changes secondary to chronic venous insufficiency (e.g. pigmentation and eczema)
	+ superficial thrombophlebitis
	+ an active or healed venous leg ulcer
* possible treatments:
	+ endothermal ablation: using either radiofrequency ablation or endovenous laser treatment
	+ foam sclerotherapy: irritant foam → inflammatory response → closure of the vein
	+ surgery: either ligation or stripping
