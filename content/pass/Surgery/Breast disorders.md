The table below describes some of the features seen in the most common breast disorders:  
  


| **Disorder** | **Features** |
| --- | --- |
| **Fibroadenoma** | Common in women under the age of 30 yearsOften described as 'breast mice' due as they are discrete, non\-tender, highly mobile lumps |
| **Fibroadenosis (fibrocystic disease, benign mammary dysplasia)** | Most common in middle\-aged women'Lumpy' breasts which may be painful. Symptoms may worsen prior to menstruation |
| **Breast cancer** | Characteristically a hard, irregular lump. There may be associated nipple inversion or skin tethering**Paget's disease of the breast** \- intraductal carcinoma associated with a reddening and thickening (may resemble eczematous changes) of the nipple/areola |
| **Mammary duct ectasia** | Dilatation of the large breast ductsMost common around the menopauseMay present with a tender lump around the areola \+/\- a green nipple dischargeIf ruptures may cause local inflammation, sometimes referred to as 'plasma cell mastitis' |
| **Duct papilloma** | Local areas of epithelial proliferation in large mammary ductsHyperplastic lesions rather than malignant or premalignantMay present with blood stained discharge |
| **Fat necrosis** | More common in obese women with large breastsMay follow trivial or unnoticed traumaInitial inflammatory response, the lesion is typical firm and round but may develop into a hard, irregular breast lumpRare and may mimic breast cancer so further investigation is always warranted |
| **Breast abscess** | More common in lactating womenRed, hot tender swelling |

  
Lipomas and sebaceous cysts may also develop around the breast tissue.
