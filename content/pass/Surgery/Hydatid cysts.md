Hydatid cysts are endemic in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries. They are caused by the tapeworm parasite *Echinococcus granulosus*. An outer fibrous capsule is formed containing multiple small daughter cysts. These cysts are allergens which precipitate a **type 1 hypersensitivity reaction**.  
  
Clinical features are as follows:  
* Up to 90% of cysts occur in the liver and lungs
* Can be asymptomatic, or symptomatic if cysts \> 5cm in diameter
* Morbidity caused by cyst bursting, infection and organ dysfunction (biliary, bronchial, renal and cerebrospinal fluid outflow obstruction)
* In biliary rupture, there may be the classical triad of; biliary colic, jaundice, and urticaria

  
Investigation  
* imaging
	+ ultrasound if often used first\-line
	+ CT is the best investigation to differentiate hydatid cysts from amoebic and pyogenic cysts
* serology
	+ useful for primary diagnosis and for follow\-up after treatment
	+ wide variety of different antibody/antigen tests available

  
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment (the cyst walls must not be ruptured during removal and the contents sterilised first).
