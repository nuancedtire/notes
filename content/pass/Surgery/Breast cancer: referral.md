NICE published referral guidelines for suspected breast cancer in 2015 (our emphasis):  
  
*Refer* people using a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for breast cancer if they are:  
* aged 30 and over and have an unexplained breast lump with or without pain or
* aged 50 and over with any of the following symptoms in one nipple only: discharge, retraction or other changes of concern

  
*Consider* a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for breast cancer in people:  
* with skin changes that suggest breast cancer or
* aged 30 and over with an unexplained lump in the axilla

  
Consider non\-urgent referral in people aged under 30 with an unexplained breast lump with or without pain.
