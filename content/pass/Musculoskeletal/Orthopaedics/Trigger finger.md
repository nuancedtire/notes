Trigger finger is a common condition associated with abnormal flexion of the digits. It is thought to be caused by a disparity between the size of the tendon and pulleys through which they pass. In simple terms the tendon becomes 'stuck' and cannot pass smoothly through the pulley.  
  
Associations\* (idiopathic in the majority)  
* more common in women than men
* rheumatoid arthritis
* diabetes mellitus

  
Features  
* more common in the thumb, middle, or ring finger
* initially stiffness and snapping ('trigger') when extending a flexed digit
* a nodule may be felt at the base of the affected finger

  
Management  
* steroid injection is successful in the majority of patients. A finger splint may be applied afterwards
* surgery should be reserved for patients who have not responded to steroid injections

  
\*there is scanty evidence to support a link with repetitive use
