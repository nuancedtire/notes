The hip is a common site of fracture, especially in osteoporotic, elderly females. The blood supply to the femoral head runs up the neck and thus avascular necrosis is a risk in displaced fractures.  
  
Features  
* pain
* the classic signs are a shortened and externally rotated leg
* patients with non\-displaced or incomplete neck of femur fractures may be able to weight bear

  
Classification
--------------

  
Location  
* intracapsular (subcapital): from the edge of the femoral head to the insertion of the capsule of the hip joint
* extracapsular: these can either be trochanteric or subtrochanteric (the lesser trochanter is the dividing line)

  
The Garden system is one classification system in common use.  
* Type I: Stable fracture with impaction in valgus
* Type II: Complete fracture but undisplaced
* Type III: Displaced fracture, usually rotated and angulated, but still has boney contact
* Type IV: Complete boney disruption

  
Blood supply disruption is most common following Types III and IV.  
  
Intracapsular hip fracture
--------------------------

  
Undisplaced Fracture:  
* internal fixation, or hemiarthroplasty if unfit.

  
Displaced Fracture:  
* NICE recommend replacement arthroplasty (total hip replacement or hemiarthroplasty) to all patients with a displaced intracapsular hip fracture
* total hip replacement is favoured to hemiarthroplasty if patients:
	+ were able to walk independently out of doors with no more than the use of a stick and
	+ are not cognitively impaired and
	+ are medically fit for anaesthesia and the procedure.

  
Extracapsular hip fracture
--------------------------

  
Management  
* stable intertrochanteric fractures: dynamic hip screw
* if reverse oblique, transverse or subtrochanteric fractures: intramedullary device
