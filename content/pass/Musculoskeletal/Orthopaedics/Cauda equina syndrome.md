Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare but serious condition in which the lumbosacral nerve roots that extend below the spinal cord are compressed. It is important to consider CES in any patient who presents with new/worsening lower back pain. Late diagnosis may lead to permanent nerve damage resulting in long term leg weakness and urinary/bowel incontinence.   
  
Causes  
* the most common cause is a central disc prolapse
	+ this typically occurs at L4/5 or L5/S1
* other causes include:
	+ tumours: primary or metastatic
	+ infection: abscess, discitis
	+ trauma
	+ haematoma

  
It is important to recognise that CES may present in a variety of ways and there is no one symptom/sign that can diagnose nor exclude CES. Possible features include  
* low back pain
* bilateral sciatica
	+ present in around 50% of cases
* reduced sensation/pins\-and\-needles in the perianal area
* decreased anal tone
	+ it is good practice to check anal tone in patients with new\-onset back pain
	+ however, studies show this has poor sensitivity and specificity for CES
* urinary dysfunction
	+ e.g. incontinence, reduced awareness of bladder filling, loss of urge to void
	+ incontinence is a late sign that may indicate irreversible damage

  
Investigation  
* urgent MRI

  
Management  
* surgical decompression
