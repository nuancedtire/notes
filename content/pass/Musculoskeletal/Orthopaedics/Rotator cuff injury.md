Rotator cuff injuries are the most common cause of shoulder problems. A spectrum of disease is recognised:  
* 1\. Subacromial impingement (also known as impingement syndrome, painful arc syndrome)
* 2\. Calcific tendonitis
* 3\. Rotator cuff tears
* 4\. Rotator cuff arthropathy

  
Symptoms  
* shoulder pain worse on abduction

  
Signs  
 \-painful arc of abduction. With subacromial impingement, this is typically between 60 and 120 degrees. With rotator cuff tears the pain may be in the first 60 degrees.  
* tenderness over anterior acromion
