| **Muscle** | **Origin** | **Insertion** | **Nerve supply** | **Action** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Flexor carpi radialis | Common flexor origin and surrounding fascia | Front of bases of second and third metacarpals | Median | Flexes and abducts the carpus, part flexes the elbow and part pronates forearm |
| Palmaris longus | Common flexor origin | Apex of palmar aponeurosis | Median | Wrist flexor |
| Flexor carpi ulnaris | Small humeral head arises from the common flexor origin and adjacent fascia. Ulnar head comes from medial border of olecranon and posterior border of ulna | Pisiform and base of the fifth metacarpal | Ulnar nerve | Flexes and adducts the carpus |
| Flexor digitorum superficialis | Long linear origin from common flexor tendon, adjacent fascia and septa and medial border of the coronoid process | Via tendons in the fibrous flexor sheath. At the level of the metacarpophalangeal joint each tendon split into two, these bands pass distally to their insertions | Median | Flexor of metacarpophalangeal joint and proximal interphalangeal joint |
| Flexor digitorum profundus | Upper two thirds of the medial and anterior surface of the ulna, medial side of the olecranon, medial half of the interosseous membrane | Via tendons that lie deep to those of flexor digitorum superficialis to insert into the distal phalanx | Medial part\= ulnar, lateral part\=anterior interosseous nerve | Flexes the distal interphalangeal joints and the wrist |
