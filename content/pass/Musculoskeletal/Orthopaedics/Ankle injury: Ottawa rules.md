An ankle x\-ray is required only if there is any pain in the malleolar zone and any one of the following findings:  
* bony tenderness at the lateral malleolar zone (from the tip of the lateral malleolus to include the lower 6 cm of posterior border of the fibular)
* bony tenderness at the medial malleolar zone (from the tip of the medial malleolus to the lower 6 cm of the posterior border of the tibia)

 \-inability to walk four weight\-bearing steps immediately after the injury and in the emergency department  
  
There are also Ottawa rules available for both foot and knee injuries
