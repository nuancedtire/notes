Buckle, or torus, fractures are incomplete fractures of the shaft of a long bone that is characterised by bulging of the cortex. They typically occur in children aged 5\-10 years.  
  
As they are typically self\-limiting they do not usually require operative intervention and can sometimes be managed with splinting and immobilisation rather than a cast.
