Discitis is an infection in the intervertebral disc space. It can lead to serious complications such as sepsis or an epidural abscess.   
  
Features  
* Back pain
* General features
	+ pyrexia,
	+ rigors
	+ sepsis
* Neurological features
	+ e.g. changing lower limb neurology
	+ if an epidural abscess develops

  
Causes  
* Bacterial
	+ *Staphylococcus aureus* is the most common cause of discitis
* Viral
* TB
* Aseptic

  
Diagnosis  
* Imaging: MRI has the highest sensitivity
* CT\-guided biopsy may be required to guide antimicrobial treatment

Treatment  
* The standard therapy requires six to eight weeks of intravenous antibiotic therapy
* Choice of antibiotic is dependent on a variety of factors. The most important factor is to identify the organism with a positive culture (e.g. blood culture, or CT\-guided biopsy)
* the patient should be assessed for endocarditis e.g. with transthoracic echo or transesophageal echo. Discitis is usually due to haematogenous seeding of the vertebrae implying that the patient has had a bacteraemia and seeding could have occurred elsewhere

  
Complications  
* sepsis
* epidural abscess
