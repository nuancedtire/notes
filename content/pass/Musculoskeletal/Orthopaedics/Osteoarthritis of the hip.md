Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip is the second most common presentation of OA after the knee. It accounts for significant morbidity and total hip replacement is now one of the most common operations performed in the developed world.  
  
Risk factors  
* increasing age
* female gender (twice as common)
* obesity
* developmental dysplasia of the hip

  
Features  
* chronic history of groin ache following exercise and relieved by rest
* red flag features suggesting an alternative cause include rest pain, night pain and morning stiffness \> 2 hours
* the Oxford Hip Score is widely used to assess severity

  
Investigations  
* NICE recommends that if the features are typical then a clinical diagnosis can be made
* otherwise plain x\-rays are the first\-line investigation

Management  
* oral analgesia
* intra\-articular injections: provide short\-term benefit
* total hip replacement remains the definitive treatment

  
Complications of total hip replacement  
* perioperative
	+ venous thromboembolism
	+ intraoperative fracture
	+ nerve injury
	+ surgical site infection
* leg length discrepancy
* posterior dislocation
	+ may occur during extremes of hip flexion
	+ typically presents acutely with a 'clunk', pain and inability to weight bear
	+ on examination there is internal rotation and shortening of the affected leg

 \- aseptic loosening (most common reason for revision )  
* prosthetic joint infection
