Osteomyelitis describes an infection of the bone. It may be subclassified into:  
* haematogenous osteomyelitis
	+ results from bacteraemia
	+ is usually monomicrobial
	+ most common form in children
	+ vertebral osteomyelitis is the most common form of haematogenous osteomyelitis in adults
	+ risk factors include: sickle cell anaemia, intravenous drug user, immunosuppression due to either medication or HIV, infective endocarditis
* non\-haematogenous osteomyelitis:
	+ results from the contiguous spread of infection from adjacent soft tissues to the bone or from direct injury/trauma to bone
	+ is often polymicrobial
	+ most common form in adults
	+ risk factors include: diabetic foot ulcers/pressure sores, diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease

  
Microbiology  
* *Staph. aureus* is the most common cause except in patients with sickle\-cell anaemia where *Salmonella* species predominate

  
Investigations  
* MRI is the imaging modality of choice, with a sensitivity of 90\-100%

  
Management  
* flucloxacillin for 6 weeks
* clindamycin if penicillin\-allergic
