Types of injury
---------------

  


| **Ruptured anterior cruciate ligament** | * Sport injury * Mechanism: high twisting force applied to a bent knee * Typically presents with: loud crack, pain and RAPID joint swelling (haemoarthrosis) * Poor healing * Management: intense physiotherapy or surgery |
| --- | --- |
| **Ruptured posterior cruciate ligament** | * Mechanism: hyperextension injuries * Tibia lies back on the femur * Paradoxical anterior draw test |
| **Rupture of medial collateral ligament** | * Mechanism: leg forced into valgus via force outside the leg * Knee unstable when put into valgus position |
| **Menisceal tear** | * Rotational sporting injuries * Delayed knee swelling * Joint locking (Patient may develop skills to 'unlock' the knee * Recurrent episodes of pain and effusions are common, often following minor trauma |
| **Chondromalacia patellae** | * Teenage girls, following an injury to knee e.g. Dislocation patella * Typical history of pain on going downstairs or at rest * Tenderness, quadriceps wasting |
| **Dislocation of the patella** | * Most commonly occurs as a traumatic primary event, either through direct trauma or through severe contraction of quadriceps with knee stretched in valgus and external rotation * Genu valgum, tibial torsion and high riding patella are risk factors * Skyline x\-ray views of patella are required, although displaced patella may be clinically obvious * An osteochondral fracture is present in 5% * The condition has a 20% recurrence rate |
| **Fractured patella** | * 2 types:  i. Direct blow to patella causing undisplaced fragments ii. Avulsion fracture |
| **Tibial plateau fracture** | * Occur in the elderly (or following significant trauma in young) * Mechanism: knee forced into valgus or varus, but the knee fractures before the ligaments rupture * Varus injury affects medial plateau and if valgus injury, lateral plateau depressed fracture occurs * Classified using the Schatzker system (see below) |

  
Schatzker Classification system for tibial plateau fractures
------------------------------------------------------------

  


| **Type** | **Anatomical description** | **Features** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Vertical split of lateral condyle | Fracture through dense bone, usually in the young. It may be virtually undisplaced, or the condylar fragment may be pushed inferiorly and tilted |
| 2 | Vertical split of the lateral condyle combined with an adjacent load bearing part of the condyle | The wedge fragment (which may be of variable size), is displaced laterally; the joint is widened. Untreated, a valgus deformity may develop |
| 3 | Depression of the articular surface with intact condylar rim | The split does not extend to the edge of the plateau. Depressed fragments may be firmly embedded in subchondral bone, the joint is stable |
| 4 | Fragment of the medial tibial condyle | Two injuries are seen in this category; (1\) a depressed fracture of osteoporotic bone in the elderly. (2\) a high energy fracture resulting in a condylar split that runs from the intercondylar eminence to the medial cortex. Associated ligamentous injury may be severe |
| 5 | Fracture of both condyles | Both condyles fractured but the column of the metaphysis remains in continuity with the tibial shaft |
| 6 | Combined condylar and subcondylar fractures | High energy fracture with marked comminution |
