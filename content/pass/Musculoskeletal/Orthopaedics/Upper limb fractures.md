Colles' fracture  
* Fall onto extended outstretched hands
* Described as a dinner fork type deformity
* Classical Colles' fractures have the following 3 features:
* Features of the injury
	+ 1\. Transverse fracture of the radius
	+ 2\. 1 inch proximal to the radio\-carpal joint
	+ 3\. Dorsal displacement and angulation

  
Smith's fracture (reverse Colles' fracture)  
* Volar angulation of distal radius fragment (Garden spade deformity)
* Caused by falling backwards onto the palm of an outstretched hand or falling with wrists flexed

  
Bennett's fracture  
* Intra\-articular fracture at the base of the thumb metacarpal
* Impact on flexed metacarpal, caused by fist fights
* X\-ray: triangular fragment at the base of metacarpal

  
Monteggia's fracture  
* Dislocation of the proximal radioulnar joint in association with an ulna fracture
* Fall on outstretched hand with forced pronation
* Needs prompt diagnosis to avoid disability

  
Galeazzi fracture  
* Radial shaft fracture with associated dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint
* Occur after a fall on the hand with a rotational force superimposed on it.
* On examination, there is bruising, swelling and tenderness over the lower end of the forearm.
* X Rays reveal the displaced fracture of the radius and a prominent ulnar head due to dislocation of the inferior radio\-ulnar joint.

  
Barton's fracture  
* Distal radius fracture (Colles'/Smith's) with associated radiocarpal dislocation
* Fall onto extended and pronated wrist

  
Scaphoid fractures  
* Scaphoid fractures are the commonest carpal fractures.
* Surface of scaphoid is covered by articular cartilage with small area available for blood vessels (fracture risks blood supply)
* Forms floor of anatomical snuffbox
* Risk of fracture associated with fall onto outstretched hand (tubercle, waist, or proximal 1/3\)
* The main physical signs are swelling and tenderness in the anatomical snuff box, and pain on wrist movements and on longitudinal compression of the thumb.
* Ulnar deviation AP needed for visualization of scaphoid
* Immobilization of scaphoid fractures difficult

  
Radial head fracture  
* Fracture of the radial head is common in young adults.
* It is usually caused by a fall on the outstretched hand.
* On examination, there is marked local tenderness over the head of the radius, impaired movements at the elbow, and a sharp pain at the lateral side of the elbow at the extremes of rotation (pronation and supination).
