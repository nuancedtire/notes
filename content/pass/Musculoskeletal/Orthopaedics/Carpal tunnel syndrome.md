Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression of median nerve in the carpal tunnel.  
  
History  
* pain/pins and needles in thumb, index, middle finger
* unusually the symptoms may 'ascend' proximally
* patient shakes his hand to obtain relief, classically at night

  
Examination  
* weakness of thumb abduction (abductor pollicis brevis)
* wasting of thenar eminence (NOT hypothenar)
* Tinel's sign: tapping causes paraesthesia
* Phalen's sign: flexion of wrist causes symptoms

  
Causes  
* idiopathic
* pregnancy
* oedema e.g. heart failure
* lunate fracture
* rheumatoid arthritis

  
Electrophysiology  
* motor \+ sensory: prolongation of the action potential

  
Treatment  
* NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries currently recommends a 6\-week trial of conservative treatments if the symptoms are mild\-moderate
	+ corticosteroid injection
	+ wrist splints at night: particularly useful if transient factors present e.g. pregnancy
* if there are severe symptoms or symptoms persist with conservative management:
	+ surgical decompression (flexor retinaculum division)
