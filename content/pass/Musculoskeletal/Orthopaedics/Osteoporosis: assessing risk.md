We worry about osteoporosis because of the increased risk of fragility fractures. So how do we assess which patients are at risk and need further investigation?  
  
NICE produced guidelines in 2012: Osteoporosis: assessing the risk of fragility fracture. The following is based on those guidelines.  
  
They advise that all women aged \>\= 65 years and all men aged \>\= 75 years should be assessed. Younger patients should be assessed in the presence of risk factors, such as:  
* previous fragility fracture
* current use or frequent recent use of oral or systemic glucocorticoid
* history of falls
* family history of hip fracture
* other causes of secondary osteoporosis, for example:
	+ hypogonadism in either sex including low testosterone in men and premature menopause in women
	+ endocrine conditions, including diabetes mellitus, Cushing's disease, hyperthyroidism
	+ conditions associated with malabsorption, including inflammatory bowel disease, coeliac disease, and chronic pancreatitis.
	+ rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthropathies.
* low body mass index (BMI) (less than 18\.5 kg/m²)
* smoking
* alcohol intake of more than 14 units per week for women and more than 14 units per week for men.

  
  
Methods of risk assessment
--------------------------

  
The first step is to exclude secondary causes of osteoporosis as underlying conditions may also require treatment. Examples of secondary causes are listed above.  
  
If a patient has had a recent fragility fracture, non\-osteoporotic causes should be looked for, for example, bone metastases, myeloma and Paget's disease.  
  
A DEXA scan should be offered without calculating the fragilty risk score in the following situations:  
* \> 50 years of age with a history of fragility fracture
* \< 40 years of age who have a major risk factor for fragility fracture \- these patients should be referred to a specialist depending on the T\-score
* before starting treatments that may have a rapid adverse effect on bone density (for example, sex hormone deprivation for treatment for breast or prostate cancer)

  
### Fragility fracture risk score

  
NICE recommends using a clinical prediction tool such as FRAX or QFracture to assess a patient's 10\-year risk of developing a fracture. These take into account a number of factors, including the risk factors listed above. This is analogous to the cardiovascular risk tools such as QRISK.  
  
Interpreting the results of FRAX
--------------------------------

  
It is important to note though that there is a lot of room for pragmatism and clinical judgement in these guidelines. This reflects the approximate nature of risk scoring and multiple factors that determine fracture risk.   
  
QFracture  
* if the 10\-year fracture risk is ≥ 10% then a DEXA scan should be arranged

  
FRAX  
* a colour 'risk' is given by the calculator \- green, orange or red
* patients in the orange zone should have a DEXA scan if not already done to further refine their 10\-year risk
* patients in the red zone should also have a DEXA scan if not already done to act as a baseline and guide drug treatment

  
When should we reassess a patient's risk?
-----------------------------------------

  
NICE recommend that we recalculate a patient's risk (i.e. repeat the FRAX/QFracture):  
 *** if the original calculated risk was in the region of the intervention threshold for a proposed treatment and only after a minimum of 2 years, or
* when there has been a change in the person's risk factors**
