Achilles tendon disorders are the most common cause of posterior heel pain. Possible presentations include tendinopathy (tendinitis), partial tear and complete rupture of the Achilles tendon.   
  
Risk factors  
* quinolone use (e.g. ciprofloxacin) is associated with tendon disorders
* hypercholesterolaemia (predisposes to tendon xanthomata)

  
  
Achilles tendinopathy (tendinitis)
----------------------------------

  
Features  
* gradual onset of posterior heel pain that is worse following activity
* morning pain and stiffness are common

  
The management is typically supportive  
* simple analgesia
* reduction in precipitating activities
* calf muscle eccentric exercises: this may be self\-directed or under the guidance of physiotherapy

  
  
Achilles tendon rupture
-----------------------

  
Achilles tendon rupture should be suspected if the person describes the following whilst playing a sport or running; an audible 'pop' in the ankle, sudden onset significant pain in the calf or ankle or the inability to walk or continue the sport.   
  
An examination should be conducted using Simmond's triad, to help exclude Achilles tendon rupture. This can be performed by asking the patient to lie prone with their feet over the edge of the bed. The examiner should look for an abnormal angle of declination; Achilles tendon rupture may lead to greater dorsiflexion of the injured foot compared to the uninjured limb. They should also feel for a gap in the tendon and gently squeeze the calf muscles if there is an acute rupture of the Achilles tendon the injured foot will stay in the neutral position when the calf is squeezed.  
  
Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice for suspected Achilles tendon rupture  
  
An acute referral should be made to an orthopaedic specialist following a suspected rupture.
