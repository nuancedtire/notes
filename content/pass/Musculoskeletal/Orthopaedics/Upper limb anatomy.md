The information below contains selected facts which commonly appear in examinations:  
  


| **Nerve** | **Motor** | **Sensory** | **Typical mechanism of injury \& notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Musculocutaneous nerve (C5\-C7\) | Elbow flexion (supplies biceps brachii) and supination | Lateral part of the forearm | Isolated injury rare \- usually injured as part of brachial plexus injury |
| Axillary nerve (C5,C6\) | Shoulder abduction (deltoid muscle) | Inferior region of the deltoid muscle | Humeral neck fracture/dislocationResults in flattened deltoid |
| Radial nerve (C5\-C8\) | Extension (forearm, wrist, fingers, thumb) | Small area between the dorsal aspect of the 1st and 2nd metacarpals | Humeral midshaft fracturePalsy results in wrist drop |
| Median nerve (C6, C8, T1\) | LOAF\* musclesFeatures depend on the site of the lesion:* wrist: paralysis of thenar muscles, opponens pollicis * elbow: loss of pronation of forearm and weak wrist flexion | Palmar aspect of lateral 3½ fingers | Wrist lesion → carpal tunnel syndrome |
| Ulnar nerve (C8, T1\) | Intrinsic hand muscles except LOAF\*Wrist flexion | Medial 1½ fingers | Medial epicondyle fractureDamage may result in a 'claw hand' |
| Long thoracic nerve (C5\-C7\) | Serratus anterior |  | Often during sport e.g. following a blow to the ribs. Also possible complication of mastectomyDamage results in a winged scapula |

Diagram of the brachial plexus  
  
Erb\-Duchenne palsy ('waiter's tip')  
* due to damage of the upper trunk of the brachial plexus (C5,C6\)
* may be secondary to shoulder dystocia during birth
* the arm hangs by the side and is internally rotated, elbow extended

  
Klumpke injury  
* due to damage of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus (C8, T1\)
* as above, may be secondary to shoulder dystocia during birth. Also may be caused by a sudden upward jerk of the hand
* associated with Horner's syndrome

  
\*LOAF muscles  
* Lateral two lumbricals
* Opponens pollis
* Abductor pollis brevis
* Flexor pollis brevis
