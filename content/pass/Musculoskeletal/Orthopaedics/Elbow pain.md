The table below details some of the characteristic features of conditions causing elbow pain:  
  


| Condition | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow)** | Features* pain and tenderness localised to the lateral epicondyle * pain worse on resisted wrist extension with the elbow extended or supination of the forearm with the elbow extended * episodes typically last between 6 months and 2 years. Patients tend to have acute pain for 6\-12 weeks |
| **Medial epicondylitis (golfer's elbow)** | Features* pain and tenderness localised to the medial epicondyle * pain is aggravated by wrist flexion and pronation * symptoms may be accompanied by numbness / tingling in the 4th and 5th finger due to ulnar nerve involvement |
| **Radial tunnel syndrome** | Most commonly due to compression of the posterior interosseous branch of the radial nerve. It is thought to be a result of overuse.Features* symptoms are similar to lateral epicondylitis making it difficult to diagnose * however, the pain tends to be around 4\-5 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle * symptoms may be worsened by extending the elbow and pronating the forearm |
| **Cubital tunnel syndrome** | Due to the compression of the ulnar nerve.Features* initially intermittent tingling in the 4th and 5th finger * may be worse when the elbow is resting on a firm surface or flexed for extended periods * later numbness in the 4th and 5th finger with associated weakness |
| **Olecranon bursitis** | Swelling over the posterior aspect of the elbow. There may be associated pain, warmth and erythema. It typically affects middle\-aged male patients. |
