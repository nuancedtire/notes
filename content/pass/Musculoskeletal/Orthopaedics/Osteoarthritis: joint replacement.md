Joint replacement (arthroplasty) remains the most effective treatment for osteoarthritis patients who experience significant pain.  
  
Selection criteria  
* around 25% of patients are now younger than 60\-years\-old
* whilst obesity is often thought to be a barrier to joint replacement there is only a slight increase in short\-term complications. There is no difference in long\-term joint replacement survival

  
Surgical techniques  
* for hips the most common type of operation is a cemented hip replacement. A metal femoral component is cemented into the femoral shaft. This is accompanied by a cemented acetabular polyethylene cup
* uncemented hip replacements are becoming increasingly popular, particularly in younger more active patients. They are more expensive than conventional cemented hip replacements
* hip resurfacing is also sometimes used where a metal cap is attached over the femoral head. This is often used in younger patients and has the advantage that the femoral neck is preserved which may be useful if conventional arthroplasty is needed later in life

  
Post\-operative recovery  
* patients receive both physiotherapy and a course of home\-exercises
* walking sticks or crutches are usually used for up to 6 weeks after hip or knee replacement surgery

  
Patients who have had a hip replacement operation should receive basic advice to minimise the risk of dislocation:  
* avoiding flexing the hip \> 90 degrees
* avoid low chairs
* do not cross your legs
* sleep on your back for the first 6 weeks

  
Complications  
* wound and joint infection
* thromboembolism: NICE recommend patients receive low\-molecular weight heparin for 4 weeks following a hip replacement
* dislocation
