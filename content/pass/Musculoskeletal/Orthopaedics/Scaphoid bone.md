The scaphoid has a concave articular surface for the head of the capitate and at the edge of this is a crescentic surface for the corresponding area on the lunate.   
  
Proximally, it has a wide convex articular surface with the radius. It has a distally sited tubercle that can be palpated. The remaining articular surface is to the lateral side of the tubercle. It faces laterally and is associated with the trapezium and trapezoid bones.   
  
The narrow strip between the radial and trapezial surfaces and the tubercle gives rise to the radial collateral carpal ligament. The tubercle receives part of the flexor retinaculum. This area is the only part of the scaphoid that is available for the entry of blood vessels. It is commonly fractured and avascular necrosis may result.
