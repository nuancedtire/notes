A prolapsed lumbar disc usually produces clear dermatomal leg pain associated with neurological deficits.  
  
Features  
* leg pain usually worse than back
* pain often worse when sitting

  
The table below demonstrates the expected features according to the level of compression:  
  


| **Site of compression** | **Features** |
| --- | --- |
| **L3 nerve root compression** | Sensory loss over anterior thighWeak hip flexion, knee extension and hip adductionReduced knee reflexPositive femoral stretch test |
| **L4 nerve root compression** | Sensory loss anterior aspect of knee and medial malleolusWeak knee extension and hip adductionReduced knee reflexPositive femoral stretch test |
| **L5 nerve root compression** | Sensory loss dorsum of footWeakness in foot and big toe dorsiflexionReflexes intactPositive sciatic nerve stretch test |
| **S1 nerve root compression** | Sensory loss posterolateral aspect of leg and lateral aspect of footWeakness in plantar flexion of footReduced ankle reflexPositive sciatic nerve stretch test |

  
Management  
* similar to that of other musculoskeletal lower back pain: analgesia, physiotherapy, exercises
	+ NICE recommend using the same drugs as for back pain without sciatica symptoms i.e. first\-line is NSAIDs \+/\- proton pump inhibitors rather than using neuropathic analgesia (e.g. duloxetine)
* if symptoms persist e.g. after 4\-6 weeks) then referral for consideration of MRI is appropriate
