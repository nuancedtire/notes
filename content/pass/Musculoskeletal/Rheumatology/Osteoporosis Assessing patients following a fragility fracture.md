The management of patients following a fragility fracture depends on age.  
  
Patients \>\= 75 years of age
-----------------------------

  
Patients who've had a fragility fracture and are \>\= 75 years of age are presumed to have underlying osteoporosis and should be started on first\-line therapy (an oral bisphosphonate), without the need for a DEXA scan.  
  
It should be noted that the 2014 NOGG guidelines have a different threshold, suggesting treatment is started in all women over the age of 50 years who've had a fragility fracture \- *'although BMD measurement may sometimes be appropriate, particularly in younger postmenopausal women.'*  
  
Patients \< 75 years of age
---------------------------

  
If a patient is under the age of 75 years a DEXA scan should be arranged. These results can then be entered into a FRAX assessment (along with the fact that they've had a fracture) to determine the patients ongoing fracture risk.  
  
For example, a 79\-year\-old woman falls over on to an outstretched hand and sustains a Colles' fracture (fracture of the distal radius). Given her age she is presumed to have osteoporosis and therefore started on oral alendronate 70mg once weekly. No DEXA scan is arranged.
