Reactive arthritis is one of the HLA\-B27 associated seronegative spondyloarthropathies. It encompasses what was formerly called Reiter's syndrome\*, a term which described a classic triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis and arthritis following a dysenteric illness during the Second World War. Later studies identified patients who developed symptoms following a sexually transmitted infection (post\-STI, now sometimes referred to as sexually acquired reactive arthritis, SARA).  
  
Reactive arthritis is defined as an arthritis that develops following an infection where the organism cannot be recovered from the joint.
