The management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been revolutionised by the introduction of disease\-modifying therapies in the past decade.   
  
Patients with evidence of joint inflammation should start a combination of disease\-modifying drugs (DMARD) as soon as possible. Other important treatment options include analgesia, physiotherapy and surgery.  
  
Initial therapy  
* NICE recommend DMARD **monotherapy** \+/\- a short\-course of bridging prednisolone. In the past dual DMARD therapy was advocated as the initial step
* choices for initial DMARD monotherapy:
	+ **methotrexate** is the most widely used DMARD. Monitoring of FBC \& LFTs is essential due to the risk of myelosuppression and liver cirrhosis. Other important side\-effects include pneumonitis
	+ sulfasalazine
	+ leflunomide
	+ hydroxychloroquine: should only be considered for initial therapy if mild or palindromic disease

  
Monitoring response to treatment  
* NICE recommends using a combination of CRP and disease activity (using a composite score such as DAS28) to assess response to treatment

  
Flares  
* flares of RA are often managed with corticosteroids \- oral or intramuscular

  
TNF\-inhibitors  
* the current indication for a TNF\-inhibitor is an inadequate response to at least two DMARDs including methotrexate
* etanercept: recombinant human protein, acts as a decoy receptor for TNF\-α, subcutaneous administration, can cause demyelination, risks include reactivation of tuberculosis
* infliximab: monoclonal antibody, binds to TNF\-α and prevents it from binding with TNF receptors, intravenous administration, risks include reactivation of tuberculosis
* adalimumab: monoclonal antibody, subcutaneous administration

  
Rituximab  
* anti\-CD20 monoclonal antibody, results in B\-cell depletion
* two 1g intravenous infusions are given two weeks apart
* infusion reactions are common

  
Abatacept  
* fusion protein that modulates a key signal required for activation of T lymphocytes
* leads to decreased T\-cell proliferation and cytokine production
* given as an infusion
* not currently recommend by NICE
