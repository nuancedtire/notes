Diagnosed after at least 3 months of disabling fatigue affecting mental and physical function more than 50% of the time in the absence of other disease which may explain symptoms  
  
Epidemiology  
* more common in females
* past psychiatric history has not been shown to be a risk factor

  
Fatigue is the central feature, other recognised features include  
* sleep problems, such as insomnia, hypersomnia, unrefreshing sleep, a disturbed sleep\-wake cycle
* muscle and/or joint pains
* headaches
* painful lymph nodes without enlargement
* sore throat
* cognitive dysfunction, such as difficulty thinking, inability to concentrate, impairment of short\-term memory, and difficulties with word\-finding
* physical or mental exertion makes symptoms worse
* general malaise or 'flu\-like' symptoms
* dizziness
* nausea
* palpitations

  
Investigation  
* NICE guidelines suggest carrying out a large number of screening blood tests to exclude other pathology e.g. FBC, U\&E, LFT, glucose, TFT, ESR, CRP, calcium, CK, ferritin, coeliac screening and also urinalysis

  
Diagnosis  
* NICE publish diagnostic criteria [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng206/chapter/Recommendations#managing-mecfs:~:text=Symptoms%20for%20suspecting%20ME/CFS "NICE - 2021 Chronic fatigue syndrome guidelines")
* a diagnosis is typically made if the symptoms persist for 3 months

  
Management  
* refer to a specialist CFS service if the diagnostic criteria are met and symptoms have persisted for 3 months
* energy management
	+ a self\-management strategy that involves a person with ME/CFS managing their activities to stay within their energy limit, with support from a healthcare professional
* physical activity and exercise
	+ do not advise people with ME/CFS to undertake exercise that is not part of a programme overseen by an ME/CFS specialist team
	+ should only be recommended if patients 'feel ready to progress their physical activity beyond their current activities of daily living'
	+ graded exercise therapy used to be recommended but is now specifically not recommended by NICE
* cognitive behavioural therapy
	+ NICE stress this is 'supportive' rather than curative for CFS

  
CFS has a better prognosis in children.
