Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder affecting exocrine glands resulting in dry mucosal surfaces. It may be primary (PSS) or secondary to rheumatoid arthritis or other connective tissue disorders, where it usually develops around 10 years after the initial onset. Sjogren's syndrome is much more common in females (ratio 9:1\). There is a marked increased risk of lymphoid malignancy (40\-60 fold).
