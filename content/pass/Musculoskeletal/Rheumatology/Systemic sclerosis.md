Systemic sclerosis is a condition of unknown aetiology characterised by hardened, sclerotic skin and other connective tissues. It is four times more common in females.  
  
There are three patterns of disease:  
  
Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis  
* Raynaud's may be the first sign
* scleroderma affects face and distal limbs predominately
* associated with anti\-centromere antibodies
* a subtype of limited systemic sclerosis is CREST syndrome: Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, oEsophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia

  
Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis  
* scleroderma affects trunk and proximal limbs predominately
* associated with anti scl\-70 antibodies
* the most common cause of death is now respiratory involvement, which is seen in around 80%: interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)
* other complications include renal disease and hypertension
	+ patients with renal disease should be started on an ACE inhibitor
* poor prognosis

  
Scleroderma (without internal organ involvement)  
* tightening and fibrosis of skin
* may be manifest as plaques (morphoea) or linear

Antibodies  
* ANA positive in 90%
* RF positive in 30%
* anti\-scl\-70 antibodies associated with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis
	+ associated with a higher risk of severe interstitial lung disease
* anti\-centromere antibodies associated with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis
