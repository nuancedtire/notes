Pathophysiology  
* most common organism overall is *Staphylococcus aureus*
	+ in young adults who are sexually active, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* is the most common organism (disseminated gonococcal infection)
* the most common cause is hematogenous spread
	+ this may be from distant bacterial infections e.g. abscesses
* in adults, the most common location is the knee

  
Features  
* acute, swollen joint
	+ restricted movement in 80% of patients
	+ examination findings: warm to touch/fluctuant
* fever: present in the majority of patients

  
Investigations  
* synovial fluid sampling is obligatory
	+ this should be done prior to the administration of antibiotics if necessary
	+ may need to be done under radiographic guidance
	+ shows a leucocytosis with neutrophil predominance
	+ gram staining is negative in around 30\-50% of cases
	+ fluid culture is positive in patients with non\-gonococcal septic arthritis
* blood cultures: the most common cause of septic arthritis is hematogenous spread
* joint imaging

  
Management  
* intravenous antibiotics which cover Gram\-positive cocci are indicated. The BNF currently recommends flucloxacillin or clindamycin if penicillin allergic
	+ antibiotic treatment is normally be given for several weeks (BNF states 4\-6 weeks)
	+ patients are typically switched to oral antibiotics after 2 weeks
* needle aspiration should be used to decompress the joint
* arthroscopic lavage may be required
