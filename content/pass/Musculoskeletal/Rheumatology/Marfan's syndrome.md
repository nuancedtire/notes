Marfan's syndrome is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder. It is caused by a defect in the FBN1 gene on chromosome 15 that codes for the protein fibrillin\-1. It affects around 1 in 3,000 people.

The life expectancy of patients used to be around 40\-50 years. With the advent of regular echocardiography monitoring and beta\-blocker/ACE\-inhibitor therapy this has improved significantly over recent years. Aortic dissection and other cardiovascular problems remain the leading cause of death however.
