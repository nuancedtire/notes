Advancing age and female sex are significant risk factors for osteoporosis. The prevalence of osteoporosis increases from 2% at 50 years to more than 25% at 80 years in women.  
  
There are many other risk factors and secondary causes of osteoporosis. We'll start by looking at the most 'important' ones \- these are risk factors that are used by major risk assessment tools such as FRAX:  
* history of glucocorticoid use
* rheumatoid arthritis
* alcohol excess
* history of parental hip fracture
* low body mass index
* current smoking

  
Other risk factors  
* sedentary lifestyle
* premature menopause
* Caucasians and Asians
* endocrine disorders: hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism (e.g. Turner's, testosterone deficiency), growth hormone deficiency, hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus
* multiple myeloma, lymphoma
* gastrointestinal disorders: inflammatory bowel disease, malabsorption (e.g. coeliac's), gastrectomy, liver disease
* chronic kidney disease
* osteogenesis imperfecta, homocystinuria

  
Medications that may worsen osteoporosis (other than glucocorticoids):  
* SSRIs
* antiepileptics
* proton pump inhibitors
* glitazones
* long term heparin therapy
* aromatase inhibitors e.g. anastrozole

  
Investigations for secondary causes
-----------------------------------

  
If a patient is diagnosed with osteoporosis or has a fragility fracture further investigations may be warranted. NOGG recommend testing for the following reasons:  
* exclude diseases that mimic osteoporosis (e.g. osteomalacia, myeloma);
* identify the cause of osteoporosis and contributory factors;
* assess the risk of subsequent fractures;
* select the most appropriate form of treatment

  
The following investigations are recommended by NOGG:  
* History and physical examination
* Blood cell count, sedimentation rate or C\-reactive protein, serum calcium,

albumin, creatinine, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase and liver transaminases  
* Thyroid function tests
* Bone densitometry ( DXA)

  
Other procedures, if indicated  
* Lateral radiographs of lumbar and thoracic spine/DXA\-based vertebral imaging
* Protein immunoelectrophoresis and urinary Bence\-Jones proteins
* 25OHD
* PTH
* Serum testosterone, SHBG, FSH, LH (in men),
* Serum prolactin
* 24 hour urinary cortisol/dexamethasone suppression test
* Endomysial and/or tissue transglutaminase antibodies (coeliac disease)
* Isotope bone scan
* Markers of bone turnover, when available
* Urinary calcium excretion

  
So from the first list we should order the following bloods as a minimum for all patients:  
* full blood count
* urea and electrolytes
* liver function tests
* bone profile
* CRP
* thyroid function tests
