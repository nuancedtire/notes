Azathioprine is metabolised to the active compound mercaptopurine, a purine analogue that inhibits purine synthesis. A thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) test may be needed to look for individuals prone to azathioprine toxicity.  
  
Adverse effects include  
* bone marrow depression
	+ consider a full blood count if infection/bleeding occurs
* nausea/vomiting
* pancreatitis
* increased risk of non\-melanoma skin cancer

  
A significant interaction may occur with allopurinol and hence lower doses of azathioprine should be used.  
  
Azathioprine is generally considered safe to use in pregnancy.
