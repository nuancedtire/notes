Psoriatic arthropathy is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis and is classed as one of the seronegative spondyloarthropathies. It correlates poorly with cutaneous psoriasis and often precedes the development of skin lesions. Around 10\-20% of patients with skin lesions develop an arthropathy with males and females being equally affected.  
  
Presentation
------------

  
Patterns  
* symmetric polyarthritis
	+ very similar to rheumatoid arthritis
	+ 30\-40% of cases, most common type
* asymmetrical oligoarthritis: typically affects hands and feet (20\-30%)
	+ until recently it was thought asymmetrical oligoarthritis was the most common type, based on data from the original 1973 Moll and Wright paper. Please see the link for a comparison of more recent studies
* sacroiliitis
* DIP joint disease (10%)
* arthritis mutilans (severe deformity fingers/hand, 'telescoping fingers')

  
Other signs  
* psoriatic skin lesions
* periarticular disease \- tenosynovitis and soft tissue inflammation resulting in:
	+ enthesitis: inflammation at the site of tendon and ligament insertion e.g. Achilles tendonitis, plantar fascitis
	+ tenosynovitis: typically of the flexor tendons of the hands
	+ dactylitis: diffuse swelling of a finger or toe
* nail changes
	+ pitting
	+ onycholysis

  
Investigation and management
----------------------------

  
X\-ray  
* often have the unusual combination of coexistence of erosive changes and new bone formation
* periostitis
* 'pencil\-in\-cup' appearance

  
Management  
* should be managed by a rheumatologist
* treatment is similar to that of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the following differences are noted:
	+ mild peripheral arthritis/mild axial disease may be treated with 'just' an NSAID, rather than all patients being on disease\-modifying therapy as with RA
	+ if more moderate/severe disease then methotrexate is typically used as in RA
	+ use of monoclonal antibodies such as ustekinumab (targets both IL\-12 and IL\-23\) and secukinumab (targets IL\-17\)
	+ apremilast: phosphodiesterase type\-4 (PDE4\) inhibitor â†’ suppression of pro\-inflammatory mediator synthesis and promotion of anti\-inflammatory mediators
	+ has a better prognosis than RA
