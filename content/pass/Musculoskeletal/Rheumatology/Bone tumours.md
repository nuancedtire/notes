Benign tumours
--------------

  


| **Tumour** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| Osteoma | * benign 'overgrowth' of bone, most typically occuring on the skull * associated with Gardner's syndrome (a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis, FAP) |
| Osteochondroma (exotosis) | * most common benign bone tumour * more in males, usually diagnosed in patients aged \< 20 years * cartilage\-capped bony projection on the external surface of a bone |
| Giant cell tumour | * tumour of multinucleated giant cells within a fibrous stroma * peak incidence: 20\-40 years * occurs most frequently in the epiphyses of long bones * X\-ray shows a 'double bubble' or 'soap bubble' appearance |

  
Malignant tumours
-----------------

  


| **Tumour** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| Osteosarcoma | * most common primary malignant bone tumour * seen mainly in children and adolescents * occurs most frequently in the metaphyseal region of long bones prior to epiphyseal closure, with 40% occuring in the femur, 20% in the tibia, and 10% in the humerus * x\-ray shows Codman triangle (from periosteal elevation) and 'sunburst' pattern * mutation of the Rb gene significantly increases risk of osteosarcoma (hence association with retinoblastoma) * other predisposing factors include Paget's disease of the bone and radiotherapy |
| Ewing's sarcoma | * small round blue cell tumour * seen mainly in children and adolescents * occurs most frequently in the pelvis and long bones. Tends to cause severe pain * associated with t(11;22\) translocation which results in an EWS\-FLI1 gene product * x\-ray shows 'onion skin' appearance |
| Chondrosarcoma | * malignant tumour of cartilage * most commonly affects the axial skeleton * more common in middle\-age |
