Gout is a form of microcrystal synovitis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate in the synovium. It is caused by chronic hyperuricaemia (uric acid \> 0\.45 mmol/l).  
  
Drug causes  
* diuretics: thiazides, furosemide
* ciclosporin
* alcohol
* cytotoxic agents
* pyrazinamide
* aspirin: it was previously thought that only high\-dose aspirin could precipitate gout. However, a systematic review (see link) showed that low\-dose (e.g. 75mg) also increases the risk of gout attacks. This obviously needs to be balanced against the cardiovascular benefits of aspirin and the study showed patients coprescribed allopurinol were not at an increased risk
