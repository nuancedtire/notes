NICE updated its guidelines on the management of osteoarthritis (OA) in 2022  
* all patients should be offered help with weight loss, given advice about local muscle strengthening exercises and general aerobic fitness
* topical NSAIDs are first\-line analgesics. Topical NSAIDs may be particualrly beneficial for patients with OA of the knee or hand [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng226/chapter/Recommendations#diagnosis:~:text=Offer%20a%20topical%20non%2Dsteroidal%20anti%2Dinflammatory%20drug%20(NSAID) "NICE - 2022 osteoarthritis guidelines")
* second\-line treatment is oral NSAIDs
	+ a proton pump inhibitor should be co\-prescribed with NSAIDs
	+ these drugs should be avoided if the patient takes aspirin
* NICE recommend we do not offer paracetamol or weak opioids, unless: [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng226/chapter/Recommendations#diagnosis:~:text=Do%20not%20routinely%20offer%20paracetamol%20or%20weak%20opioids%20unless "NICE - 2022 osteoarthritis guidelines")
	+ they are only used infrequently for short\-term pain relief and
	+ all other pharmacological treatments are contraindicated, not tolerated or ineffective
* glucosamine and strong opioids are not recommended
* non\-pharmacological treatment options include walking aids for knee and hip OA
* intra\-articular steroid injections may be tried if standard pharmacological treatment is ineffective
	+ patients should be aware that they only provide short\-term relief (2\-10 weeks)
* if conservative methods fail then refer for consideration of joint replacement
