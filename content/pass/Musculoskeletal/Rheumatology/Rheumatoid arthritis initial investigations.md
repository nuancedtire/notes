### Rheumatoid arthritis

  
Rheumatoid factor (RF) is a circulating antibody (usually IgM) that reacts with the Fc portion of the patients own IgG.. It is recommended as the first\-line antibody test for patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis.  
  
RF can be detected by either  
* Rose\-Waaler test: sheep red cell agglutination
* Latex agglutination test (less specific)

  
RF is positive in 70\-80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, high titre levels are associated with severe progressive disease (but NOT a marker of disease activity.  
  
Other conditions associated with a positive RF include:  
* Felty's syndrome (around 100%)
* Sjogren's syndrome (around 50%)
* infective endocarditis (around 50%)
* SLE (\= 20\-30%)
* systemic sclerosis (\= 30%)
* general population (\= 5%)
* rarely: TB, HBV, EBV, leprosy

  
  
### Anti\-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody

  
Anti\-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody may be detectable up to 10 years before the development of rheumatoid arthritis. It has a key role in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, allowing early detection of patients suitable for aggressive anti\-TNF therapy. It has a sensitivity similar to rheumatoid factor (around 70%) with a much higher specificity of 90\-95%.  
  
NICE recommends that patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis who are rheumatoid factor negative should be tested for anti\-CCP antibodies.  
  
  
X\-rays
-------

  
NICE recommend performing x\-rays of the hands and feet of all patients with suspected rheumatoid arthritis.
