Paget's disease is a disease of increased but uncontrolled bone turnover. It is thought to be primarily a disorder of osteoclasts, with excessive osteoclastic resorption followed by increased osteoblastic activity. Paget's disease is common (UK prevalence 5%) but symptomatic in only 1 in 20 patients. The skull, spine/pelvis, and long bones of the lower extremities are most commonly affected.  
  
Predisposing factors  
* increasing age
* male sex
* northern latitude
* family history

  
Clinical features \- only 5% of patients are symptomatic  
* the stereotypical presentation is an older male with bone pain and an isolated raised ALP
* bone pain (e.g. pelvis, lumbar spine, femur)
* classical, untreated features: bowing of tibia, bossing of skull

  
Investigations  
* bloods
	+ raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
	+ calcium and phosphate are typically normal. Hypercalcaemia may occasionally occur with prolonged immobilisation
* other markers of bone turnover include
	+ procollagen type I N\-terminal propeptide (PINP)
	+ serum C\-telopeptide (CTx)
	+ urinary N\-telopeptide (NTx)
	+ urinary hydroxyproline
* x\-rays
	+ osteolysis in early disease â†’ mixed lytic/sclerotic lesions later
	+ skull x\-ray: thickened vault, osteoporosis circumscripta
* bone scintigraphy
	+ increased uptake is seen focally at the sites of active bone lesions

  
Management  
* indications for treatment include
	+ bone pain
	+ skull or long bone deformity
	+ fracture
	+ periarticular Paget's
* bisphosphonate (either oral risedronate or IV zoledronate)
* calcitonin is less commonly used now

  
Complications  
* deafness (cranial nerve entrapment)
* bone sarcoma (1% if affected for \> 10 years)
* fractures
* skull thickening
* high\-output cardiac failure
