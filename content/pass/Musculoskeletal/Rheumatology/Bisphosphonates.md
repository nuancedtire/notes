Bisphosphonates are analogues of pyrophosphate, a molecule which decreases demineralisation in bone. They inhibit osteoclasts by reducing recruitment and promoting apoptosis.  
  
Clinical uses  
* prevention and treatment of osteoporosis
* hypercalcaemia
* Paget's disease
* pain from bone metatases

  
Adverse effects  
* oesophageal reactions: oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers (especially alendronate)
* osteonecrosis of the jaw
	+ substantially greater risk for patients receiving IV bisphosphonates in the treatment of cancer than for patients receiving oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis or Paget's disease
	+ poor dental hygiene/prior dental procedures are also a risk factor
	+ the BNF advises that *'all patients with cancer and patients with poor dental status should have a dental check\-up ... before bisphosphonate treatment'*
* increased risk of atypical stress fractures of the proximal femoral shaft in patients taking alendronate
* acute phase response: fever, myalgia and arthralgia may occur following administration
* hypocalcaemia: due to reduced calcium efflux from bone. Usually clinically unimportant

  
The BNF suggests the following counselling for patients taking oral bisphosphonates  
* 'Tablets should be swallowed whole with plenty of water while sitting or standing; to be given on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes before breakfast (or another oral medication); patient should stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes after taking tablet'

  
Hypocalcemia/vitamin D deficiency should be corrected before giving bisphosphonates. However, when starting bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis, calcium should only be prescribed if dietary intake is inadequate. Vitamin D supplements are normally given.  
  
The duration of bisphosphonate treatment varies according to the level of risk. Some authorities recommend stopping bisphosphonates at 5 years if the following apply:  
* patient is \< 75\-years\-old
* femoral neck T\-score of \> \-2\.5
* low risk according to FRAX/NOGG
