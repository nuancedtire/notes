The National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) updated their guidelines in 2021\. NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries guidelines also have a section on the management of osteoporosis, largely based on the NOGG guidelines. Remember that osteporosis is usually asymptomatic until a fracture occurs. When thinking about osteoporosis management it is useful to think about a number of potential clinical scenarios:  
* a patient who has been identified as being at high risk of a fragility fracture based on a QFracture or FRAX score (please see the textbook entry on 'Osteoporosis: assessing risk')
* a patient who is about to start treatment that puts them at significant risk of developing osteoporosis \- the most common example is longer\-term glucocorticoids
* a patient who has just had a fragility fracture e.g. a symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fracture

  
General management points
-------------------------

  
General points about the management of all patients  
* all patients who are at risk of osteoporosis or have osteoporosis should be given advice regarding:
	+ lifestyle changes: a healthy, balanced diet, moderation of alcohol consumption and avoidance of smoking
	+ a sufficient dietary calcium and vitamin D intake: supplementation should be offered to all women unless the clinician is confident they have adequate calcium intake and are vitamin D replete
	+ encourage a combination of regular weight\-bearing and muscle strengthening exercise
* secondary causes of osteoporosis should be considered and treated
	+ e.g. hypogonadism in women or men e.g. hormone replacement therapy for premature menopause
* bisphosphonates are the first\-line drug treatment for patients at risk of fragility fractures
	+ oral bisphosphonates such as alendronate and risedronate are typically first\-line. These are often taken weekly are need taking in a particular way to minimise the risk of oesophageal side\-effects
	+ however, the NOGG recommend IV zoledronate as the first\-line treatment following a hip fracture. This is given yearly
* denosumab is generally used as a second\-line treatment
* other possible treatment options include:
	+ strontium ranelate
	+ raloxifene
	+ teriparatide
	+ romosozumab

  
Clinical scenarios
------------------

  
Fragility risk fracture assessment  
* if a patient is deemed high\-risk based on a QFracture or FRAX score they should have a DEXA scan to assess bone mineral density (BMD)
	+ the BMD threshold for defining osteoporosis is a T\-score of \- 2\.5 SD or below
	+ some patients may not be suitable for BMD assessment due to frailty etc.
* general osteoporosis management as above
* oral bisphosphonates are used first\-line e.g. alendronate or risedronate

  
Postmenopausal women, and men age ≥50, who are treated with oral glucocorticoids:  
* if starting ≥7\.5 mg/day prednisolone or equivalent for the next 3 months, start bone protective treatment at the same time
* general osteoporosis management as above
* don't wait for a DEXA scan before starting treatment
* oral bisphosphonates are used first\-line e.g. alendronate or risedronate

  
A postmenopausal woman, or a man age ≥50 has a symptomatic osteoporotic vertebral fracture:  
* general osteoporosis management as above
* start treatment straight away \- oral bisphosphonates are used first\-line e.g. alendronate or risedronate

  
Hip fracture in older adults  
* in older adults a hip fracture is a manifestation of osteoporosis
	+ following a fragility fracture in women ≥ 75 years, a DEXA scan is not necessary to diagnose osteoporosis and hence commence a bisphosphonate
	+ BMD should be measured, but this acts as a baseline rather than determining whether treatment should be given
* bisphosphonates should be given first\-line
	+ NOGG recommends IV zoledronate but local guidelines may vary and oral bisphosphonates are often used

  
Follow\-up
----------

  
Plan to prescribe oral bisphosphonates for at least 5 years, or intravenous bisphosphonates for at least 3 years and then re\-assess fracture risk.  
  
Supplementary notes on treatment
--------------------------------

  
Bisphosphonates  
* bisphosphonates bind to hydroxyapatite in bone, inhibiting osteoclast\-mediated bone resorption
* common side effects include gastrointestinal discomfort, oesophagitis, and hypocalcaemia. Atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw are rare but serious risks.
* available in oral and intravenous formulations. Oral bisphosphonates should be taken with a full glass of water, on an empty stomach, and the patient should remain upright for at least 30 minutes afterwards.

  
Denosumab  
* human monoclonal antibody that inhibits RANK ligand, which in turn inhibits the maturation of osteoclasts
* also used for cancer patients with bone metastases to reduce skeletal\-related events.
* given as a single subcutaneous injection every 6 months

  
Raloxifene   
* selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM)
* has been shown to prevent bone loss and to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures, but has not yet been shown to reduce the risk of non\-vertebral fractures
* has been shown to increase bone density in the spine and proximal femur
* may worsen menopausal symptoms
* increased risk of thromboembolic events
* may decrease the risk of breast cancer

  
Strontium ranelate   
* 'dual action bone agent' \- increases deposition of new bone by osteoblasts (promotes differentiation of pre\-osteoblast to osteoblast) and reduces the resorption of bone by inhibiting osteoclasts
* concerns regarding the safety profile of strontium have been raised recently. It should only be prescribed by a specialist in secondary care
* due to these concerns the European Medicines Agency in 2014 said it should only be used by people for whom there are no other treatments for osteoporosis
* increased risk of cardiovascular events: any history of cardiovascular disease or significant risk of cardiovascular disease is a contraindication
* increased risk of thromboembolic events: a Drug Safety Update in 2012 recommended it is not used in patients with a history of venous thromboembolism
* may cause serious skin reactions such as Stevens Johnson syndrome

  
Teriparatide  
* recombinant form of parathyroid hormone
* very effective at increasing bone mineral density but role in the management of osteoporosis yet to be clearly defined

  
Romosozumab  
* a monoclonal antibody that inhibits sclerostin, thereby increasing bone formation and decreasing bone resorption
* this dual action significantly improves bone density and reduces fracture risk.
