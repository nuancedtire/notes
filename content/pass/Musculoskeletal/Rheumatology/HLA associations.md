HLA antigens are encoded for by genes on chromosome 6. HLA A, B and C are class I antigens whilst DP, DQ, DR are class II antigens. Questions are often based around which diseases have strong HLA associations. The most important associations are listed below:  
  
HLA\-A3  
* haemochromatosis

  
HLA\-B51  
* Behcet's disease

  
HLA\-B27  
* ankylosing spondylitis
* reactive arthritis
* acute anterior uveitis
* psoriatic arthritis

  
HLA\-DQ2/DQ8  
* coeliac disease

  
HLA\-DR2  
* narcolepsy
* Goodpasture's

  
HLA\-DR3  
* dermatitis herpetiformis
* Sjogren's syndrome
* primary biliary cirrhosis

  
HLA\-DR4  
* type 1 diabetes mellitus\*
* rheumatoid arthritis \- in particular the DRB1 gene (DRB1\*04:01 and DRB1\*04:04 hence the association with DR4\)

  
\*type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with HLA\-DR3 but is more strongly associated with HLA\-DR4\.
