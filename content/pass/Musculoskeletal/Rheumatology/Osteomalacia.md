Osteomalacia describes softening of the bones secondary to low vitamin D levels that in turn lead to decreased bone mineral content. If this occurs in growing children it is referred to as rickets, with the term osteomalacia preferred for adults.  
  
Causes  
* vitamin D deficiency
	+ malabsorption
	+ lack of sunlight
	+ diet
* chronic kidney disease
* drug induced e.g. anticonvulsants
* inherited: hypophosphatemic rickets (previously called vitamin D\-resistant rickets)
* liver disease: e.g. cirrhosis
* coeliac disease

  
Features  
* bone pain
* bone/muscle tenderness
* fractures: especially femoral neck
* proximal myopathy: may lead to a waddling gait

  
Investigation  
* bloods
	+ low vitamin D levels
	+ low calcium, phosphate (in around 30%)
	+ raised alkaline phosphatase (in 95\-100% of patients)
* x\-ray
	+ translucent bands (Looser's zones or pseudofractures)

  
Treatment  
* vitamin D supplmentation
	+ a loading dose is often needed initially
* calcium supplementation if dietary calcium is inadequate
