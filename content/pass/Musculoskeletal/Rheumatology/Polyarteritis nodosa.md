Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a vasculitis affecting medium\-sized arteries with necrotizing inflammation leading to aneurysm formation. PAN is more common in middle\-aged men and is associated with hepatitis B infection.  
  
Features  
* fever, malaise, arthralgia
* weight loss
* hypertension
* mononeuritis multiplex, sensorimotor polyneuropathy
* testicular pain
* livedo reticularis
* haematuria, renal failure
* perinuclear\-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are found in around 20% of patients with 'classic' PAN
* hepatitis B serology positive in 30% of patients

Angiogram from a patient with polyarteritis nodosa. Both kidneys demonstrate beading and numerous microaneurysms affecting the intrarenal vessels. Similar changes are seen affecting the intrahepatic vessels with a few small microaneurysms noted. The proximal branches of the SMA appears normal; however there are no normal straight arteries from the jejunal arteries and lack of normal anastomotic arcades and loops. This is associated with multiple microaneurysms.
