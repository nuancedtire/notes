Antibodies  
* 99% are ANA positive
	+ this high sensitivity makes it a useful rule out test, but it has low specificity
* 20% are rheumatoid factor positive
* anti\-dsDNA: highly specific (\> 99%), but less sensitive (70%)
* anti\-Smith: highly specific (\> 99%), sensitivity (30%)
* also: anti\-U1 RNP, SS\-A (anti\-Ro) and SS\-B (anti\-La)

  
Monitoring  
* inflammatory markers
	+ ESR is generally used
	+ during active disease the CRP may be normal \- a raised CRP may indicate underlying infection
* complement levels (C3, C4\) are low during active disease (formation of complexes leads to consumption of complement)
* anti\-dsDNA titres can be used for disease monitoring (but note not present in all patients)
