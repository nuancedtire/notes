Overview  
* an inflammatory disorder causing symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness and characteristic skin lesions
* may be idiopathic or associated with connective tissue disorders or underlying malignancy (typically ovarian, breast and lung cancer, found in 20\-25% \- more if patient older). Screening for an underlying malignancy is usually performed following a diagnosis of dermatomyositis
* polymyositis is a variant of the disease where skin manifestations are not prominent

  
Skin features  
* photosensitive
* macular rash over back and shoulder
* heliotrope rash in the periorbital region
* Gottron's papules \- roughened red papules over extensor surfaces of fingers
* 'mechanic's hands': extremely dry and scaly hands with linear 'cracks' on the palmar and lateral aspects of the fingers
* nail fold capillary dilatation

  
Other features  
* proximal muscle weakness \+/\- tenderness
* Raynaud's
* respiratory muscle weakness
* interstitial lung disease: e.g. Fibrosing alveolitis or organising pneumonia
* dysphagia, dysphonia

  
Investigations  
* the majority of patients (around 80%) are ANA positive
* around 30% of patients have antibodies to aminoacyl\-tRNA synthetases (anti\-synthetase antibodies), including:
	+ antibodies against histidine\-tRNA ligase (also called Jo\-1\)
	+ antibodies to signal recognition particle (SRP)
	+ anti\-Mi\-2 antibodies
