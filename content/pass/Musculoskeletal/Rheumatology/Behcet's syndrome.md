Behcet's syndrome is a complex multisystem disorder associated with presumed autoimmune\-mediated inflammation of the arteries and veins. The precise aetiology has yet to be elucidated however. The classic triad of symptoms are oral ulcers, genital ulcers and anterior uveitis  
  
Epidemiology  
* more common in the eastern Mediterranean (e.g. Turkey)
* more common in men (complicated gender distribution which varies according to country. Overall, Behcet's is considered to be more common and more severe in men)
* tends to affect young adults (e.g. 20 \- 40 years old)
* associated with HLA B51
* around 30% of patients have a positive family history

  
Features  
* classically: 1\) oral ulcers 2\) genital ulcers 3\) anterior uveitis
* thrombophlebitis and deep vein thrombosis
* arthritis
* neurological involvement (e.g. aseptic meningitis)
* GI: abdo pain, diarrhoea, colitis
* erythema nodosum

  
Diagnosis  
* no definitive test
* diagnosis based on clinical findings
* positive pathergy test is suggestive (puncture site following needle prick becomes inflamed with small pustule forming)

  
\*more specifically HLA B51, a split antigen of HLA B5
