Vitamin D supplementation has been a hot topic for a number of years now. The muddied waters are now slightly clearer following the release of the following:  
* 2012: letter by the Chief Medical Officer regarding vitamin D supplementation
* 2013: National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) release UK Vitamin D guideline

  
The following groups should be advised to take vitamin D supplementation:  
* all pregnant and breastfeeding women should take a daily supplement containing 10Âµg of vitamin D
* all children aged 6 months \- 5 years. Babies fed with formula milk do not need to take a supplement if they are taking more than 500ml of milk a day, as formula milk is fortified with vitamin D
* adults \> 65 years
* 'people who are not exposed to much sun should also take a daily supplement' e.g. housebound patients

  
Testing for vitamin D deficiency
--------------------------------

  
The key message is that not many people warrant a vitamin D test. The NOS guidelines specify that testing may be appropriate in the following situtations:  
* patients with bone diseases that may be improved with vitamin D treatment e.g. known osteomalacia or Paget's disease
* patients with bone diseases, prior to specific treatment where correcting vitamin deficiency is appropriate e,g, prior to intravenous zolendronate or denosumab
* patients with musculoskeletal symptoms that could be attributed to vitamin D deficiency e.g. bone pain ?osteomalacia

  
Patients with osteoporosis should always be given calcium/vitamin D supplements so testing is not considered necessary. People who are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency (see above) should be treated anyway so again testing is not necessary.
