Antiphospholipid syndrome is an acquired disorder characterised by a predisposition to both venous and arterial thromboses, recurrent fetal loss and thrombocytopenia. It may occur as a primary disorder or secondary to other conditions, most commonly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Around 30% of patients with SLE have positive antiphospholipid antibodies.  
  
A key point for the exam is to appreciate that antiphospholipid syndrome causes a paradoxical rise in the APTT. This is due to an ex\-vivo reaction of the lupus anticoagulant autoantibodies with phospholipids involved in the coagulation cascade.  
  
Associations other than SLE  
* other autoimmune disorders
* lymphoproliferative disorders
* phenothiazines (rare)

  
Features  
* venous/arterial thrombosis
* recurrent miscarriages
* livedo reticularis
* other features: pre\-eclampsia, pulmonary hypertension

  
Investigations  
* antibodies
	+ anticardiolipin antibodies
	+ anti\-beta2 glycoprotein I (anti\-beta2GPI) antibodies
	+ lupus anticoagulant
* thrombocytopenia
* prolonged APTT

  
Management \- based on EULAR guidelines  
* primary thromboprophylaxis
	+ low\-dose aspirin
* secondary thromboprophylaxis
	+ initial venous thromboembolic events: lifelong warfarin with a target INR of 2\-3
	+ recurrent venous thromboembolic events: lifelong warfarin; if occurred whilst taking warfarin then consider adding low\-dose aspirin, increase target INR to 3\-4
	+ arterial thrombosis should be treated with lifelong warfarin with target INR 2\-3
