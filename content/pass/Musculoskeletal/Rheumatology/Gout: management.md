Gout is a form of microcrystal synovitis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate in the synovium. It is caused by chronic hyperuricaemia (uric acid \> 450 µmol/l)  
  
Acute management  
* NSAIDs or colchicine are first\-line
	+ the maximum dose of NSAID should be prescribed until 1\-2 days after the symptoms have settled
	+ gastroprotection (e.g. a proton pump inhibitor) may also be indicated
* colchicine
	+ inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to tubulin, interfering with mitosis. Also inhibits neutrophil motility and activity
	+ has a slower onset of action
	+ may be used with caution in renal impairment: the BNF advises to reduce the dose if eGFR is 10\-50 ml/min and to avoid if eGFR \< 10 ml/min [BNF](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drugs/colchicine/#renal-impairment "BNF - Colchicine")
	+ the main side\-effect is diarrhoea
* oral steroids may be considered if NSAIDs and colchicine are contraindicated.
	+ a dose of prednisolone 15mg/day is usually used
* another option is intra\-articular steroid injection
* if the patient is already taking allopurinol it should be continued

  
Indications for urate\-lowering therapy (ULT)  
* the British Society of Rheumatology Guidelines now advocate offering urate\-lowering therapy to all patients after their **first attack of gout**
* ULT is *particularly* recommended if:
	+ \>\= 2 attacks in 12 months
	+ tophi
	+ renal disease
	+ uric acid renal stones
	+ prophylaxis if on cytotoxics or diuretics

  
Urate\-lowering therapy  
* it has traditionally been taught that urate\-lowering therapy should not be started until 2 weeks after an acute attack, as starting too early may precipitate a further attack. The evidence base to support this however looks weak
* in 2017 the BSR updated their guidelines. They still support a delay in starting urate\-lowering therapy because it is better for a patient to make long\-term drug decisions whilst not in pain
	+ the key passage is: *'Commencement of ULT is best delayed until inflammation has settled as ULT is better discussed when the patient is not in pain'*
* allopurinol is first\-line
	+ initial dose of 100 mg od, with the dose titrated every few weeks to aim for a serum uric acid of \< 360 µmol/l [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/gout/management/preventing-gout/#:~:text=Aim%20for%20a%20target%20serum%20urate%20level%20below%20360%20micromol/L "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - Gout guidelines")
	+ a lower target uric acid level below 300 µmol/L may be considered for patients who have tophi, chronic gouty arthritis or continue to have ongoing frequent flares despite having a uric acid below 360 µmol/L
	+ a lower initial dose of allopurinol should be given if the patient has a reduced eGFR
	+ colchicine cover should be considered when starting allopurinol. NSAIDs can be used if colchicine cannot be tolerated. The BSR guidelines suggest this may need to be continued for 6 months
* the second\-line agent when allopurinol is not tolerated or ineffective is febuxostat (also a xanthine oxidase inhibitor)
* in refractory cases other agents may be tried:
	+ uricase (urate oxidase) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of urate to the degradation product allantoin. It is present in certain mammals but not humans
	+ in patients who have persistent symptomatic and severe gout despite the adequate use of urate\-lowering therapy, pegloticase (polyethylene glycol modified mammalian uricase) can achieve rapid control of hyperuricemia. It is given as an infusion once every two weeks

  
Lifestyle modifications  
* reduce alcohol intake and avoid during an acute attack
* lose weight if obese
* avoid food high in purines e.g. Liver, kidneys, seafood, oily fish (mackerel, sardines) and yeast products

  
Other points  
* consideration should be given to stopping precipitating drugs (such as thiazides)
* losartan has a specific uricosuric action and may be particularly suitable for the many patients who have coexistent hypertension
* increased vitamin C intake (either supplements or through normal diet) may also decrease serum uric acid levels
