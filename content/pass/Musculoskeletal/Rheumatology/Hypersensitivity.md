The Gell and Coombs classification divides hypersensitivity traditionally divides reactions into 4 types:  
  


| Type | Mechanism | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Type I \- Anaphylactic** | Antigen reacts with IgE bound to mast cells | • Anaphylaxis• Atopy (e.g. asthma, eczema and hayfever) |
| **Type II \- Cell bound** | IgG or IgM binds to antigen on cell surface | • Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia• ITP• Goodpasture's syndrome• Pernicious anaemia• Acute haemolytic transfusion reactions• Rheumatic fever• Pemphigus vulgaris / bullous pemphigoid |
| **Type III \- Immune complex** | Free antigen and antibody (IgG, IgA) combine | • Serum sickness• Systemic lupus erythematosus• Post\-streptococcal glomerulonephritis• Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (especially acute phase) |
| **Type IV \- Delayed hypersensitivity** | T\-cell mediated | • Tuberculosis / tuberculin skin reaction• Graft versus host disease• Allergic contact dermatitis• Scabies• Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (especially chronic phase)• Multiple sclerosis• Guillain\-Barre syndrome |

  
In recent times a further category has been added:  
  


| Type | Mechanism | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Type V** | Antibodies that recognise and bind to the cell surface receptors. This either stimulating them or blocking ligand binding | • Graves' disease• Myasthenia gravis |
