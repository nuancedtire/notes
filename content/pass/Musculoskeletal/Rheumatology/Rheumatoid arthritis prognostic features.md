A number of features have been shown to predict a poor prognosis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, as listed below  
  
Poor prognostic features  
* rheumatoid factor positive
* anti\-CCP antibodies
* poor functional status at presentation
* X\-ray: early erosions (e.g. after \< 2 years)
* extra articular features e.g. nodules
* HLA DR4
* insidious onset

  
  
In terms of gender there seems to be a split in what the established sources state is associated with a poor prognosis. However both the American College of Rheumatology and the recent NICE guidelines (which looked at a huge number of prognosis studies) seem to conclude that female gender is associated with a poor prognosis.
