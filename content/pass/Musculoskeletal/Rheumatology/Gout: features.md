Features
--------

  
Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis. Patients typically have episodes lasting several days when their gout flares and are often symptom\-free between episodes. The acute episodes typically develop maximal intensity with 12 hours. The main features it presents with are:  
* pain: this is often very significant
* swelling
* erythema

  
Around 70% of first presentations affect the 1st metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. Attacks of gout affecting this area were historically called podagra. Other commonly affected joints include:  
* ankle
* wrist
* knee

  
If untreated repeated acute episodes of gout can damage the joints resulting in a more chronic joint problem.  
  
Investigations
--------------

  
Uric acid  
* NICE recommends measuring uric acid levels in suspected gout (i.e. in the acute setting)
	+ a uric acid level â‰¥ 360 umol/L is seen as supporting a diagnosis
	+ if uric acid level \< 360 umol/L during a flare and gout is strongly suspected, repeat the uric acid level measurement at least 2 weeks after the flare has settled

  
Synovial fluid analysis  
* needle shaped negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals under polarised light

  
Radiological features of gout include:  
* joint effusion is an early sign
* well\-defined 'punched\-out' erosions with sclerotic margins in a juxta\-articular distribution, often with overhanging edges
* relative preservation of joint space until late disease
* eccentric erosions
* no periarticular osteopenia (in contrast to rheumatoid arthritis)
* soft tissue tophi may be seen
