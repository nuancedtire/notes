NICE updated its depression guidelines in 2022\. It now favours a simple classification of depression severity  
* 'less severe' depression: encompasses what was previously termed subthreshold and mild depression
	+ a PHQ\-9 score of \< 16
* 'more severe' depression: encompasses what was previously termed moderate and severe depression
	+ a PHQ\-9 score of â‰¥ 16

  
The NICE guidelines are long and contain many important principles about dealing with patients who have depression. The following is a very brief section highlighting key points.  
  
Management of less severe depression
------------------------------------

  
NICE lists a large number of interventions that may be used first\-line. It encourages us to discuss treatment options with patients to reach a shared decision. They recommend considering *'the least intrusive and least resource intensive treatment first'*. It also recommends not routinely offering *'antidepressant medication as first\-line treatment for less severe depression, unless that is the person's preference'.*  
  
Treatment options, listed in order of preference by NICE  
* guided self\-help
* group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)
* group behavioural activation (BA)
* individual CBT
* individual BA
* group exercise
* group mindfulness and meditation
* interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)
* selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
* counselling
* short\-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)

  
Management of more severe depression
------------------------------------

  
Again, NICE recommend a shared decision should be made.   
  
Treatment options, listed in order of preference by NICE  
* a combination of individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and an antidepressant
* individual CBT
* individual behavioural activation (BA)
* antidepressant medication
	+ selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), or
	+ serotonin\-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), or
	+ another antidepressant if indicated based on previous clinical and treatment history
* individual problem\-solving
* counselling
* short\-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP)
* interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT)
* guided self\-help
* group exercise
