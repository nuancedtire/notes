Mechanism  
* chronic alcohol consumption enhances GABA mediated inhibition in the CNS (similar to benzodiazepines) and inhibits NMDA\-type glutamate receptors
* alcohol withdrawal is thought to be lead to the opposite (decreased inhibitory GABA and increased NMDA glutamate transmission)

  
Features  
* symptoms start at 6\-12 hours: tremor, sweating, tachycardia, anxiety
* peak incidence of seizures at 36 hours
* peak incidence of delirium tremens is at 48\-72 hours: coarse tremor, confusion, delusions, auditory and visual hallucinations, fever, tachycardia

  
Management  
* patients with a history of complex withdrawals from alcohol (i.e. delirium tremens, seizures, blackouts) should be admitted to hospital for monitoring until withdrawals stabilised
* first\-line: long\-acting benzodiazepines e.g. chlordiazepoxide or diazepam. Lorazepam may be preferable in patients with hepatic failure. Typically given as part of a reducing dose protocol
* carbamazepine also effective in treatment of alcohol withdrawal
* phenytoin is said not to be as effective in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures
