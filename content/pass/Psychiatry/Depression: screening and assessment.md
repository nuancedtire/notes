Screening
---------

  
The following two questions can be used to screen for depression  
* 'During the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed or hopeless?'
* 'During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little interest or pleasure in doing things?'

  
A 'yes' answer to either of the above should prompt a more in depth assessment.   
  
Assessment
----------

  
There are many tools to assess the degree of depression including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ\-9\).  
  
Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale  
* consists of 14 questions, 7 for anxiety and 7 for depression
* each item is scored from 0\-3
* produces a score out of 21 for both anxiety and depression
* severity: 0\-7 normal, 8\-10 borderline, 11\+ case
* patients should be encouraged to answer the questions quickly

  
Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ\-9\)  
* asks patients 'over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by any of the following problems?'
* 9 items which can then be scored 0\-3
* includes items asking about thoughts of self\-harm

  
Traditionally, depression severity has been grouped under 4 categories (subthreshold, mild, moderate and severe). The updated NICE guideline uses a simpler 2 category definition of depression: less severe or more severe depression.  
  
Less severe depression encompasses subthreshold and mild depression, and more severe depression encompasses moderate and severe depression. Thresholds on validated scales were used in this guideline as an indicator of severity  
* a score \< 16 on the PHQ\-9: less severe depression
* a score of â‰¥ 16 on the PHQ\-9: severe depression

  
The DSM\-5 also provides criteria for diagnosing major depressive disorder (MDD), commonly referred to as depression.   
  
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) DSM\-5 Criteria:
------------------------------------------------

  
Five (or more) of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2\-week period and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1\) depressed mood or (2\) loss of interest or pleasure.   
* Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
* Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).
* Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
* Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
* Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
* Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.
* Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self\-reproach or guilt about being sick).
* Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
* Recurrent thoughts of death (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.
