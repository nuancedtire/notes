Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder causing increased viscosity of secretions (e.g. lungs and pancreas). It is due to a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR), which codes a cAMP\-regulated chloride channel  
  
In the UK 80% of CF cases are due to delta F508 on the long arm of chromosome 7\. Cystic fibrosis affects 1 per 2500 births, and the carrier rate is c. 1 in 25
