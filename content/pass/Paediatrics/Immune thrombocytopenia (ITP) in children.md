Immune (or idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an immune\-mediated reduction in the platelet count. Antibodies are directed against the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or Ib\-V\-IX complex. It is an example of a type II hypersensitivity reaction.  
  
ITP in children is typically more acute than in adults and may follow an infection or vaccination.   
  
Features  
* bruising
* petechial or purpuric rash
* bleeding is less common and typically presents as epistaxis or gingival bleeding

  
Investigation  
* full blood count
	+ should demonstrate an isolated thrombocytopenia
* blood film
* bone marrow examinations is only required if there are atypical features e.g.
	+ lymph node enlargement/splenomegaly, high/low white cells
	+ failure to resolve/respond to treatment

  
Management  
* usually, no treatment is required
	+ ITP resolves in around 80% of children with 6 months, with or without treatment
* advice to avoid activities that may result in trauma (e.g. team sports)
* other options may be indicated if the platelet count is very low (e.g. \< 10 \* 109/L) or there is significant bleeding. Options include:
	+ oral/IV corticosteroid
	+ IV immunoglobulins
	+ platelet transfusions can be used in an emergency (e.g. active bleeding) but are only a temporary measure as they are soon destroyed by the circulating antibodies
