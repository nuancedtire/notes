Autosomal recessive conditions are often thought to be 'metabolic' as opposed to autosomal dominant conditions being 'structural', notable exceptions:  
* some 'metabolic' conditions such as Hunter's and G6PD are X\-linked recessive whilst others such as hyperlipidemia type II and hypokalemic periodic paralysis are autosomal dominant
* some 'structural' conditions such as ataxia telangiectasia and Friedreich's ataxia are autosomal recessive
  
The following conditions are autosomal recessive:  
* Albinism
* Ataxic telangiectasia
* Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
* Cystic fibrosis
* Cystinuria
* Familial Mediterranean Fever
* Fanconi anaemia
* Friedreich's ataxia
* Gilbert's syndrome\*
* Glycogen storage disease
* Haemochromatosis
* Homocystinuria
* Lipid storage disease: Tay\-Sach's, Gaucher, Niemann\-Pick
* Mucopolysaccharidoses: Hurler's
* PKU
* Sickle cell anaemia
* Thalassaemias
* Wilson's disease

  
\*this is still a matter of debate and many textbooks will list Gilbert's as autosomal dominant
