Children in the UK have been routinely immunised against serotypes A \& C of meningococcus for many years. As a result meningococcal B became the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in the UK. A vaccination against meningococcal B (Bexsero) has recently been developed and introduced to the UK market.  
  
The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) initially rejected the use of Bexsero after doing a cost\-benefit analysis. This descision was eventually reversed and meningitis B has now been added to the routine NHS immunisation.   
  
Three doses are now given at:  
* 2 months
* 4 months
* 12\-13 months

  
Bexsero will also be available on the NHS for patients at high risk of meningococcal disease, such as people with asplenia, splenic dysfunction or complement disorder.
