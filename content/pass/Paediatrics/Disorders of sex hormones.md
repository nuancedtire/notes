The table below summarises the findings in patients who have disorders of sex hormones:  
  


| **Disorder** | **LH** | **Testosterone** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary hypogonadism (Klinefelter's syndrome) | High | Low |
| Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (Kallman's syndrome) | Low | Low |
| Androgen insensitivity syndrome | High | Normal/high |
| Testosterone\-secreting tumour | Low | High |

  
Klinefelter's syndrome
----------------------

  
Klinefelter's syndrome is associated with karyotype 47, XXY  
  
Features  
* often taller than average
* lack of secondary sexual characteristics
* small, firm testes
* infertile
* gynaecomastia \- increased incidence of breast cancer
* elevated gonadotrophin levels

  
Diagnosis is by chromosomal analysis  
  
  
Kallman's syndrome
------------------

  
Kallman's syndrome is a recognised cause of delayed puberty secondary to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. It is usually inherited as an X\-linked recessive trait. Kallman's syndrome is thought to be caused by failure of GnRH\-secreting neurons to migrate to the hypothalamus.  
  
The clue given in many questions is lack of smell (anosmia) in a boy with delayed puberty  
  
Features  
* 'delayed puberty'
* hypogonadism, cryptorchidism
* anosmia
* sex hormone levels are low
* LH, FSH levels are inappropriately low/normal
* patients are typically of normal or above average height

  
Cleft lip/palate and visual/hearing defects are also seen in some patients  
  
  
Androgen insensitivity syndrome
-------------------------------

  
Androgen insensitivity syndrome is an X\-linked recessive condition due to end\-organ resistance to testosterone causing genotypically male children (46XY) to have a female phenotype. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is the new term for testicular feminisation syndrome  
  
Features  
* 'primary amenorrhoea'
* undescended testes causing groin swellings
* breast development may occur as a result of conversion of testosterone to oestradiol

  
Diagnosis  
* buccal smear or chromosomal analysis to reveal 46XY genotype

  
Management  
* counselling \- raise child as female
* bilateral orchidectomy (increased risk of testicular cancer due to undescended testes)
* oestrogen therapy
