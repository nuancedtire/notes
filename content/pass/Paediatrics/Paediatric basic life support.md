The 2015 Resuscitation Council guidelines made the following changes to paediatric basic life support  
* compression:ventilation ratio: lay rescuers should use a ratio of 30:2\. If there are two or more rescuers with a duty to respond then a ratio of 15:2 should be used
* age definitions: an infant is a child under 1 year, a child is between 1 year and puberty

  
Key points of algorithm (please see link attached for more details)  
* unresponsive?
* shout for help
* open airway
* look, listen, feel for breathing
* give 5 rescue breaths
* check for signs of circulation
	+ infants use brachial or femoral pulse, children use femoral pulse
* 15 chest compressions:2 rescue breaths (see above)
	+ chest compressions should be 100\-120/min for both infants and children
	+ depth: depress the lower half of the sternum by at least one\-third of the anterior\-posterior dimension of the chest (which is approximately 4 cm for an infant and 5 cm for a child)
	+ in children: compress the lower half of the sternum
	+ in infants: use a two\-thumb encircling technique for chest compression
