Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs in around 1 in 2,000 newborns. It is characterised by the herniation of abdominal viscera into the chest cavity due to incomplete formation of the diaphragm. This can result in pulmonary hypoplasia and hypertension which causes respiratory distress shortly after birth.   
  
Pathophysiology  
* usually represents a failure of the pleuroperitoneal canal to close completely

  
The most common type of CDH is a left\-sided posterolateral Bochdalek hernia which accounts for around 85% of cases.  
  
Only around 50% of newborns with CDH survive despite modern medical intervention.
