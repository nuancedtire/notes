General management points

* disposable nappies are preferable to towel nappies
* expose napkin area to air when possible
* apply barrier cream (e.g. Zinc and castor oil)
* mild steroid cream (e.g. 1% hydrocortisone) in severe cases
* management of suspected candidal nappy rash is with a topical imidazole. Cease the use of a barrier cream until the candida has settled
