Embryology
----------

  
During development the umbilicus has two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein. The arteries are continuous with the internal iliac arteries and the vein is continuous with the falciform ligament (ductus venosus). After birth, the cord dessicates and separates and the umbilical ring closes.   
  
Umbilical hernia
----------------

  
Up to 20% of neonates may have an umbilical hernia, it is more common in premature infants. The majority of these hernias will close spontaneously (may take between 12 months and three years). Strangulation is rare.  
  
Paraumbilical hernia
--------------------

  
These are due to defects in the linea alba that are in close proximity to the umbilicus. The edges of a paraumbilical hernia are more clearly defined than those of an umbilical hernia. They are less likely to resolve spontaneously than an umbilical hernia.  
  
Omphalitis
----------

  
This condition consists of an infection of the umbilicus. Infection with *Staphylococcus aureus* is the commonest cause. The condition is potentially serious as infection may spread rapidly through the umbilical vessels in neonates with a risk of portal pyaemia, and portal vein thrombosis. Treatment is usually with a combination of topical and systemic antibiotics.  
  
Umbilical granuloma
-------------------

  
These consist of cherry red lesions surrounding the umbilicus, they may bleed on contact and be a site of seropurulent discharge. Infection is unusual and they will often respond favourably to chemical cautery with topically applied silver nitrate.   
  
Persistent urachus
------------------

  
This is characterised by urinary discharge from the umbilicus. It is caused by persistence of the urachus which attaches to the bladder. They are associated with other urogenital abnormalities.   
  
Persistent vitello\-intestinal duct
-----------------------------------

  
This will typically present as an umbilical discharge that discharges small bowel content. Complete persistence of the duct is a rare condition. Much more common is the persistence of part of the duct (Meckel's diverticulum). Persistent vitello\-intestinal ducts are best imaged using a contrast study to delineate the anatomy and are managed by laparotomy and surgical closure.
