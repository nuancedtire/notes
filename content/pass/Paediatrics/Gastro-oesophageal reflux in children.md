Gastro\-oesophageal reflux is the commonest cause of vomiting in infancy. Around 40% of infants regurgitate their feeds to a certain extent so there is a degree of overlap with normal physiological processes.  
  
Risk factors  
* preterm delivery
* neurological disorders

  
Features  
* typically develops before 8 weeks
* vomiting/regurgitation
	+ milky vomits after feeds
	+ may occur after being laid flat
* excessive crying, especially while feeding

  
Diagnosis is usually made clinically  
  
Management (partly based on the 2015 NICE guidelines)  
* advise regarding position during feeds \- 30 degree head\-up
* infants should sleep on their backs as per standard guidance to reduce the risk of cot death
* ensure infant is not being overfed (as per their weight) and consider a trial of smaller and more frequent feeds
* a trial of thickened formula (for example, containing rice starch, cornstarch, locust bean gum or carob bean gum)
* a trial of alginate therapy e.g. Gaviscon. Alginates should not be used at the same time as thickening agents
* NICE do not recommend a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) to treat overt regurgitation in infants and children occurring as an isolated symptom. A trial of one of these agents should be considered if 1 or more of the following apply:
	+ unexplained feeding difficulties (for example, refusing feeds, gagging or choking)
	+ distressed behaviour
	+ faltering growth
* ranitidine was previously used as an alternative to a PPI but was withdrawn from the market in 2020 as small amounts of the carcinogen N\-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) were discovered in products from a number of manufacturers.
* prokinetic agents e.g. metoclopramide should only be used with specialist advice

  
Complications  
* distress
* failure to thrive
* aspiration
* frequent otitis media
* in older children dental erosion may occur

  
If there are severe complications (e.g. failure to thrive) and medical treatment is ineffective then fundoplication may be considered
