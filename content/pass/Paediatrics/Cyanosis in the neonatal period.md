Peripheral cyanosis, for example of the feet and hands, is very common in the first 24 hours of life and may occur when the child is crying or unwell from any cause  
  
Central cyanosis can be recognised clinically when the concentration of reduced haemoglobin in the blood exceeds 5g/dl  
  
The **nitrogen washout test** (also known as the hyperoxia test) may be used to differentiate cardiac from non\-cardiac causes. The infant is given 100% oxygen for ten minutes after which arterial blood gases are taken. A pO2 of less than 15 kPa indicates cyanotic congenital heart disease  
  
Causes of cyanotic congenital heart disease  
* tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)
* transposition of the great arteries (TGA)
* tricuspid atresia

  
Initial management of suspected cyanotic congenital heart disease  
* supportive care
* prostaglandin E1 e.g. alprostadil
	+ used to maintain a patent ductus arteriosus in ductal\-dependent congenital heart defect
	+ this can act as a holding measure until a definite diagnosis is made and surgical correction performed

  
Acrocyanosis
------------

  
Acrocyanosis is often seen in healthy newborns and refers to cyanosis around the mouth and the extremities such as the hands and feet. It is differentiated from other causes of peripheral cyanosis with significant pathology as it occurs immediately after birth in healthy infants. It is a common finding and may persist for 24 to 48 hours.
