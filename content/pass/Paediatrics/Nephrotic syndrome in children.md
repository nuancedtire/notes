Nephrotic syndrome is classically defined as a triad of  
* proteinuria (\> 1 g/m^2 per 24 hours)
* hypoalbuminaemia (\< 25 g/l)
* oedema

  
In children the peak incidence is between 2 and 5 years of age. Around 80% of cases in children are due to a condition called minimal change glomerulonephritis. The condition generally carries a good prognosis with around 90% of cases responding to high\-dose oral steroids.  
  
Other features include hyperlipidaemia, a hypercoagulable state (due to loss of antithrombin III) and a predisposition to infection (due to loss of immunoglobulins)
