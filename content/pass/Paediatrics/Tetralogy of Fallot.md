Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cause of cyanotic congenital heart disease\*. It typically presents at around 1\-2 months, although may not be picked up until the baby is 6 months old  
  
TOF is a result of anterior malalignment of the aorticopulmonary septum. The four characteristic features are:  
* ventricular septal defect (VSD)
* right ventricular hypertrophy
* right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, pulmonary stenosis
* overriding aorta

The severity of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction determines the degree of cyanosis and clinical severity  
  
Other features  
* cyanosis
	+ unrepaired TOF infants may develop episodic hypercyanotic 'tet' spells due to near occlusion of the right ventricular outflow tract
	+ features of tet spells include tachypnoea and severe cyanosis that may occasionally result in loss of consciousness
	+ they typically occur when an infant is upset, is in pain or has a fever
* causes a right\-to\-left shunt
* ejection systolic murmur due to pulmonary stenosis (the VSD doesn't usually cause a murmur)
* a right\-sided aortic arch is seen in 25% of patients
* chest x\-ray shows a 'boot\-shaped' heart, ECG shows right ventricular hypertrophy

  
Management  
* surgical repair is often undertaken in two parts
* cyanotic episodes may be helped by beta\-blockers to reduce infundibular spasm

  
\*however, at birth transposition of the great arteries is the more common lesion as patients with TOF generally present at around 1\-2 months
