Whooping cough (pertussis) is an infectious disease caused by the Gram\-negative bacterium *Bordetella pertussis*. It typically presents in children. There are around 1,000 cases are reported each year in the UK. It is sometimes called the 'cough of 100 days'.  
  
Immunisation  
* infants are routinely immunised at 2, 3, 4 months and 3\-5 years. Newborn infants are particularly vulnerable, which is why the vaccination campaign for pregnant women was introduced
* neither infection nor immunisation results in lifelong protection \- hence adolescents and adults may develop whooping cough despite having had their routine immunisations

  
Features  
* catarrhal phase
	+ symptoms are similar to a viral upper respiratory tract infection
	+ lasts around 1\-2 weeks
* paroxysmal phase
	+ the cough increases in severity
	+ coughing bouts are usually worse at night and after feeding, may be ended by vomiting \& associated central cyanosis
	+ inspiratory whoop: not always present (caused by forced inspiration against a closed glottis)
	+ infants may have spells of apnoea
	+ persistent coughing may cause subconjunctival haemorrhages or even anoxia leading to syncope \& seizures
	+ lasts between 2\-8 weeks
* convalescent phase
	+ the cough subsides over weeks to months

  
**Diagnostic criteria**  
Whooping cough should be suspected if a person has an acute cough that has lasted for 14 days or more without another apparent cause, and has one or more of the following features:  
* Paroxysmal cough.
* Inspiratory whoop.
* Post\-tussive vomiting.
* Undiagnosed apnoeic attacks in young infants.
  
Diagnosis  
* per nasal swab culture for *Bordetella pertussis* \- may take several days or weeks to come back
* PCR and serology are now increasingly used as their availability becomes more widespread

  
Management  
* infants under 6 months with suspect pertussis should be admitted
* in the UK pertussis is a notifiable disease
* an oral macrolide (e.g. clarithromycin, azithromycin or erythromycin) is indicated if the onset of the cough is within the previous 21 days to eradicate the organism and reduce the spread
* household contacts should be offered antibiotic prophylaxis
* antibiotic therapy has not been shown to alter the course of the illness
* school exclusion: 48 hours after commencing antibiotics (or 21 days from onset of symptoms if no antibiotics )

  
Complications  
* subconjunctival haemorrhage
* pneumonia
* bronchiectasis
* seizures

  
**Vaccination of pregnant women**  
  
In 2012 there was an outbreak of whooping cough (pertussis) which resulted in the death of 14 newborn children. As a temporary measure, a vaccination programme was introduced in 2012 for pregnant women. This has successfully reduced the number of cases of whooping cough (the vaccine is thought to be more than 90% effective in preventing newborns developing whooping cough). It was however decided in 2014 to extend the whooping cough vaccination programme for pregnant women. This decision was taken as there was a 'great deal of uncertainty' about the timing of future outbreaks.  
  
Women who are between 16\-32 weeks pregnant will be offered the vaccine.
