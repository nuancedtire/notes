The current UK immunisation schedule is as follows.   
  


| **Age** | **Recommended immunisations** |
| --- | --- |
| At birth | BCG if risk factors (see below) |
| 2 months | '6\-1 vaccine' (diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, Hib and hepatitis B)Oral rotavirus vaccine Men B |
| 3 months\* | '6\-1 vaccine' (diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, Hib and hepatitis B)Oral rotavirus vaccine PCV |

At birth the BCG vaccine should be given if the baby is deemed at risk of tuberculosis (e.g. Tuberculosis in the family in the past 6 months).   
  
Meningitis ACWY vaccine
-----------------------

  
Note that the meningitis ACWY vaccine has replaced meningitis C for 13\-18 year\-olds. This is due to an increased incidence of meningitis W disease in recent years. The ACWY vaccine will also be offered to new students (up to the age of 25 years) at university. With respect to getting the vaccine, the NHS give the following advice to patients:  
  
 **'GP practices will automatically send letters inviting 17\-and 18\-year\-olds in school year 13 to have the Men ACWY vaccine.  
  
Students going to university or college for the first time as freshers, including overseas and mature students up to the age of 25, should contact their GP to have the Men ACWY vaccine, ideally before the start of the academic year'**  
Key  
* Hib \= *Haemophilus influenzae* B vaccine
* PCV \= Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine
* Men B \= Meningococcal B vaccine
* Men C \= Meningococcal C vaccine
* Men ACWY \= Meningococcal vaccine covering A, C, W and Y serotypes
* MMR \= Measles, Mumps, Rubella vaccine
* HPV \= Human Papilloma Vaccine

  
\***Meningitis C vaccine**  
  
This used to be given at 3 months but has now been discountinued. The NHS immunisation website states:  
  
 **From July 1 2016, the Men C vaccine will be discontinued from the NHS childhood vaccination programme.  
  
The success of the Men C vaccination programme means there are almost no cases of Men C disease in babies or young children on the UK any longer.  
  
The dose of Men C vaccine that used to be offered to babies at 12 weeks of age has therefore been removed from the vaccination schedule.  
  
All children will continue to be offered the Hib/Men C vaccine at one year of age, and the Men ACWY vaccine at 14 years of age to provide protection across all age groups.**
