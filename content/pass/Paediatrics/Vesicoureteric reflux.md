Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is the abnormal backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureter and kidney. It is a relatively common abnormality of the urinary tract in children and predisposes to urinary tract infection (UTI), being found in around 30% of children who present with a UTI. As around 35% of children develop renal scarring it is important to investigate for VUR in children following a UTI  
  
Pathophysiology of VUR  
* ureters are displaced laterally, entering the bladder in a more perpendicular fashion than at an angle
* therefore shortened intramural course of the ureter
* vesicoureteric junction cannot, therefore, function adequately

  
Possible presentations  
* antenatal period: hydronephrosis on ultrasound
* recurrent childhood urinary tract infections
* reflux nephropathy
	+ term used to describe chronic pyelonephritis secondary to VUR
	+ commonest cause of chronic pyelonephritis
	+ renal scar may produce increased quantities of renin causing hypertension

  
Investigation  
* VUR is normally diagnosed following a micturating cystourethrogram
* a DMSA scan may also be performed to look for renal scarring

  
The table below summarises the grading of VUR  
  


| **Grade** |  |
| --- | --- |
| I | Reflux into the ureter only, no dilatation |
| II | Reflux into the renal pelvis on micturition, no dilatation |
| III | Mild/moderate dilatation of the ureter, renal pelvis and calyces |
| IV | Dilation of the renal pelvis and calyces with moderate ureteral tortuosity |
| V | Gross dilatation of the ureter, pelvis and calyces with ureteral tortuosity |
