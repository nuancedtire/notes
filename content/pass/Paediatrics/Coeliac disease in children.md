Coeliac disease is caused by sensitivity to the protein gluten. Repeated exposure leads to villous atrophy which in turn causes malabsorption. Children normally present before the age of 3 years, following the introduction of cereals into the diet  
  
Genetics  
* incidence of around 1:100

Features may coincide with the introduction of cereals (i.e. gluten)  
* failure to thrive
* diarrhoea
* abdominal distension
* older children may present with anaemia
* many cases are not diagnosed to adulthood

  
Diagnosis  
* jejunal biopsy showing subtotal villous atrophy
* anti\-endomysial and anti\-gliadin antibodies are useful screening tests
