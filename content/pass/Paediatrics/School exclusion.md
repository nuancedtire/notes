\*the official advice regarding school exclusion for chickenpox has gone back and forth over recent years. In September 2017 Public Health England advocated the following:  
  
 **Cases of chickenpox are generally infectious from 2 days before the rash appears to 5 days after the onset of rash.  
  
Although the usual exclusion period is 5 days, all lesions should be crusted over before children return to nursery or school.**  
However, Clinical Knowledge Summaries are a bit vaguer:  
  
 **Advise that the most infectious period is 1\-2 days before the rash appears, but infectivity continues until all the lesions are dry and have crusted over (usually about 5 days after the onset of the rash).**
