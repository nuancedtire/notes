Apparent abnormalities in the lower limbs of developing children can cause parental concern and is a common reason for presentation to primary care, often resulting in referral to secondary care.  
  
The table below lists some of the common presentations:  
  


| Description | Typical age of presentation | Signs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Flat feet (pes planus)** | All ages | Absent medial arch on standing | Typically resolves between the ages of 4\-8 yearsOrthotics are not recommendedParental reassurance appropriate |
| **In toeing** | 1st year |  | Possible causes:* metatarsus adductus: abnormal heel bisector line. 90% of cases resolve spontaneously, severe/persistent cases may require serial casting * internal tibial torsion: difference the thigh and foot ankle: resolves in the vast majority * femoral anteversion: 'W' sign resolves in around 80% by adolescence, surgical intervention in the remaining not usually advised |
| **Out toeing** | All ages |  | Common in early infancy and usually resolves by the age of 2 yearsUsually due to external tibial torsionIntervention may be appropriate if doesn't resolve as increases risk of patellofemoral pain |
| **Bow legs (genu varum)** | 1st\-2nd year | Increased intercondylar distance | Typically resolves by the age of 4\-5 years |
| **Knock knees (genu valgum)** | 3rd\-4th year | Increased intermalleolar distance | Typically resolves spontaneously |
