Autosomal recessive conditions are often thought to be 'metabolic' as opposed to autosomal dominant conditions being 'structural', notable exceptions:  
* some 'metabolic' conditions such as Hunter's and G6PD are X\-linked recessive whilst others such as hyperlipidaemia type II and hypokalaemic periodic paralysis are autosomal dominant
* some 'structural' conditions such as ataxia telangiectasia and Friedreich's ataxia are autosomal recessive
  
The following conditions are autosomal dominant:  
* Achondroplasia
* Acute intermittent porphyria
* Adult polycystic disease
* Antithrombin III deficiency
* Ehlers\-Danlos syndrome
* Familial adenomatous polyposis
* Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia
* Hereditary spherocytosis
* Hereditary non\-polyposis colorectal carcinoma
* Huntington's disease
* Hyperlipidaemia type II
* Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis
* Malignant hyperthermia
* Marfan's syndromes
* Myotonic dystrophy
* Neurofibromatosis
* Noonan syndrome
* Osteogenesis imperfecta
* Peutz\-Jeghers syndrome
* Retinoblastoma
* Romano\-Ward syndrome
* tuberous sclerosis
* Von Hippel\-Lindau syndrome
* Von Willebrand's disease\*

  
\*type 3 von Willebrand's disease (most severe form) is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Around 80% of patients have type 1 disease
