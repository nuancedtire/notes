Surfactant deficient lung disease (SDLD, also known as respiratory distress syndrome and previously as hyaline membrane disease) is a condition seen in premature infants. It is caused by insufficient surfactant production and structural immaturity of the lungs  
  
The risk of SDLD decreases with gestation  
* 50% of infants born at 26\-28 weeks
* 25% of infants born at 30\-31 weeks

  
Other risk factors for SDLD include  
* male sex
* diabetic mothers
* Caesarean section
* second born of premature twins

  
Clinical features are those common to respiratory distress in the newborn, i.e. tachypnoea, intercostal recession, expiratory grunting and cyanosis  
  
Chest x\-ray characteristically shows 'ground\-glass' appearance with an indistinct heart border  
  
Management  
* prevention during pregnancy: maternal corticosteroids to induce fetal lung maturation
* oxygen
* assisted ventilation
* exogenous surfactant given via endotracheal tube
