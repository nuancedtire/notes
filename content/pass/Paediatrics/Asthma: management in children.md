NICE released guidance on the management of asthma in 2017\. These followed on quickly from the 2016 British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines. Given previous precedents where specialist societies or Royal colleges eventually default/contribute to NICE, we have followed the NICE guidance for the notes and questions.  
  
Children aged 5\-16 with asthma are now managed in a very similar way to adults  
  
Children and young people aged 5 to 16
--------------------------------------

  
NICE do not follow the stepwise approach of the previous BTS guidelines. However, to try to make the guidelines easier to follow we've added our own steps:  
  


| Step | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| 1Newly\-diagnosed asthma | Short\-acting beta agonist (SABA) |
| 2Not controlled on previous stepORNewly\-diagnosed asthma with symptoms \>\= 3 / week or night\-time waking | SABA \+ paediatric low\-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) |
| **3** | SABA \+ paediatric low\-dose ICS \+ leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) |
| **4** | SABA \+ paediatric low\-dose ICS \+ long\-acting beta agonist (LABA)In contrast to the adult guidance, NICE recommend stopping the LTRA at this point if it hasn't helped |
| **5** | SABA \+ switch ICS/LABA for a maintenance and reliever therapy (MART), that includes a paediatric low\-dose ICS |
| **6** | SABA \+ paediatric moderate\-dose ICS MARTOR consider changing back to a fixed\-dose of a moderate\-dose ICS and a separate LABA |
| **7** | SABA \+ one of the following options:* increase ICS to paediatric high\-dose, either as part of a fixed\-dose regime or as a MART * a trial of an additional drug (for example theophylline) * seeking advice from a healthcare professional with expertise in asthma |

  
  
Children aged less than 5 years
-------------------------------

  
Clearly, it can be difficult to definitively diagnose asthma in young children. NICE acknowledge the greater role for clinical judgement in this age group.  
  
Again, the stepwise approach is our own rather than NICE's:  
  


| Step | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| 1Newly\-diagnosed asthma | Short\-acting beta agonist (SABA) |
| 2Not controlled on previous stepORNewly\-diagnosed asthma with symptoms \>\= 3 / week or night\-time waking | SABA \+ an 8\-week trial of paediatric MODERATE\-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)After 8\-weeks stop the ICS and monitor the child's symptoms:* if symptoms did not resolve during the trial period, review whether an alternative diagnosis is likely * if symptoms resolved then reoccurred within 4 weeks of stopping ICS treatment, restart the ICS at a paediatric low dose as first\-line maintenance therapy * if symptoms resolved but reoccurred beyond 4 weeks after stopping ICS treatment, repeat the 8\-week trial of a paediatric moderate dose of ICS |
| **3** | SABA \+ paediatric low\-dose ICS \+ leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) |
| **4** | Stop the LTRA and refer to an paediatric asthma specialist |

  
Other points
------------

  
Maintenance and reliever therapy (MART)  
* a form of combined ICS and LABA treatment in which a single inhaler, containing both ICS and a fast\-acting LABA, is used for both daily maintenance therapy and the relief of symptoms as required
* MART is only available for ICS and LABA combinations in which the LABA has a fast\-acting component (for example, formoterol)

  
It should be noted that NICE does not advocate changing treatment in patients who have well\-controlled asthma simply to adhere to the latest guidance.

------------------------------------------------------

  
Frustratingly, the definitions of what constitutes a low, moderate or high\-dose ICS have also changed. In contrast to the BTS guidelines NICE also have different definitions for adults and children. For children:  
* \<\= 200 micrograms budesonide or equivalent \= paediatric low dose
* 200 micrograms \- 400 micrograms budesonide or equivalent \= paediatric moderate dose
* \> 400 micrograms budesonide or equivalent\= paediatric high dose.
