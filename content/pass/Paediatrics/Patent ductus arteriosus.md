Overview  
* a form of congenital heart defect
* generally classed as 'acyanotic'. However, uncorrected can eventually result in late cyanosis in the lower extremities, termed differential cyanosis
* connection between the pulmonary trunk and descending aorta
* usually, the ductus arteriosus closes with the first breaths due to increased pulmonary flow which enhances prostaglandins clearance
* more common in premature babies, born at high altitude or maternal rubella infection in the first trimester

Features  
* left subclavicular thrill
* continuous 'machinery' murmur
* large volume, bounding, collapsing pulse
* wide pulse pressure
* heaving apex beat

  
Management  
* indomethacin or ibuprofen
	+ given to the neonate
	+ inhibits prostaglandin synthesis
	+ closes the connection in the majority of cases
* if associated with another congenital heart defect amenable to surgery then prostaglandin E1 is useful to keep the duct open until after surgical repair
