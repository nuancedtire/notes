Contraindications to MMR  
* severe immunosuppression
* allergy to neomycin
* children who have received another live vaccine by injection within 4 weeks
* pregnancy should be avoided for at least 1 month following vaccination
* immunoglobulin therapy within the past 3 months (there may be no immune response to the measles vaccine if antibodies are present)
