In contrast to adults, the development of a urinary tract infection (UTI) in childhood should prompt consideration of a possible underlying causes and damage to the kidneys (renal scarring)  
  
NICE guidelines for imaging the urinary tract  
* infants \< 6 months who present with a first UTI which responds to treatment should have an ultrasound within 6 weeks
* children \> 6 months who present with a first UTI which responds to treatment do not require imaging unless there are features suggestive of an atypical infection (see below) or recurrent infection

  
Features of suggestive of an atypical infection  
* seriously ill
* poor urine flow
* abdominal or bladder mass
* raised creatinine
* septicaemia
* failure to respond to treatment with suitable antibiotics within 48 hours
* infection with non\-*E. coli* organisms

  
Possible further investigations  
* urine for microscopy and culture: urine should be sent for culture as only 50% of children with a UTI have pyuria. Microscopy or dipstick of the urine is therefore inadequate for diagnosis
* static radioisotope scan (e.g. DMSA): identifies renal scars. Should be done 4\-6 months after initial infection
* micturating cystourethrography (MCUG): identifies vesicoureteric reflux. Only recommended for infants younger than 6 months who present with atypical or recurrent infections
