In autosomal dominant diseases:  
* both homozygotes and heterozygotes manifest disease (there is no carrier state)
* both males and females affected
* only affected individuals can pass on disease
* disease is passed on to 50% of children
* normally appears in every generation (although see below)
* risk remains same for each successive pregnancy

  
Complicating factors:  
* non\-penetrance: lack of clinical signs and symptoms (normal phenotype) despite abnormal gene. E.g. 40% otosclerosis
* spontaneous mutation: new mutation in one of gametes e.g. 80% of individuals with achondroplasia have unaffected parents
