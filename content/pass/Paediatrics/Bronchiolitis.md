Bronchiolitis is a condition characterised by acute bronchiolar inflammation. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the pathogen in 75\-80% of cases. NICE released guidelines on bronchiolitis in 2015\. Please see the link for more details.  
  
Epidemiology  
* most common cause of a serious lower respiratory tract infection in \< 1yr olds (90% are 1\-9 months, with a peak incidence of 3\-6 months). Maternal IgG provides protection to newborns against RSV
* higher incidence in winter

  
Basics  
* respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the pathogen in 75\-80% of cases
* other causes: mycoplasma, adenoviruses
* may be secondary bacterial infection
* more serious if bronchopulmonary dysplasia (e.g. Premature), congenital heart disease or cystic fibrosis

  
Features  
* coryzal symptoms (including mild fever) precede:
* dry cough
* increasing breathlessness
* wheezing, fine inspiratory crackles (not always present)
* feeding difficulties associated with increasing dyspnoea are often the reason for hospital admission

  
NICE recommend immediate referral (usually by 999 ambulance) if they have any of the following:  
* apnoea (observed or reported)
* child looks seriously unwell to a healthcare professional
* severe respiratory distress, for example grunting, marked chest recession, or a respiratory rate of over 70 breaths/minute
* central cyanosis
* persistent oxygen saturation of less than 92% when breathing air.

  
NICE recommend that clinicians 'consider' referring to hospital if any of the following apply:  
* a respiratory rate of over 60 breaths/minute
* difficulty with breastfeeding or inadequate oral fluid intake (50\-75% of usual volume 'taking account of risk factors and using clinical judgement')
* clinical dehydration.

  
Investigation  
* immunofluorescence of nasopharyngeal secretions may show RSV

  
Management is largely supportive  
* humidified oxygen is given via a head box and is typically recommended if the oxygen saturations are persistently \< 92%
* nasogastric feeding may be needed if children cannot take enough fluid/feed by mouth
* suction is sometimes used for excessive upper airway secretions
