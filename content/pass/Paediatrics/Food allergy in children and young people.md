The 2011 NICE guidelines differentiate between IgE mediated and non\-IgE mediated allergies. It should be noted that the guidance does not govern food intolerance, which is not caused by immune system dysfunction.  
  
The first step is to identify possible food allergy and differentiate the possible causes:  
  


| **IgE\-mediated** | **Non\-IgE\-mediated** |
| --- | --- |
| Skin* pruritus * erythema * urticaria * angioedema  Gastrointestinal system* nausea  * colicky abdominal pain  * vomiting  * diarrhoea  Respiratory system* upper respiratory tract symptoms \- nasal itching,sneezing, rhinorrhoea or congestion (with or without conjunctivitis) * lower respiratory tract symptoms \- cough, chest tightness, wheezing or shortness of breath  Symptoms of anaphylaxis | Skin* pruritus * erythema * atopic eczema  Gastrointestinal system* gastro\-oesophageal reflux disease * loose or frequent stools * blood and/or mucus in stools * abdominal pain * infantile colic * food refusal or aversion * constipation * perianal redness * pallor and tiredness * faltering growth plus one or more gastrointestinal symptoms above (with or without significant atopic eczema) |

  
If the history is suggestive of an IgE\-mediated allergy  
* offer a skin prick test or blood tests for specific IgE antibodies to the suspected foods and likely co\-allergens

  
If the history is suggestive of an non\-IgE\-mediated allergy  
* eliminate the suspected allergen for 2\-6 weeks, then reintroduce. NICE advise to 'consult a dietitian with appropriate competencies about nutritional adequacies, timings and follow\-up'
