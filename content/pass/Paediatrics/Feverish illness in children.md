The 2007 NICE Feverish illness in children guidelines introduced a 'traffic light' system for risk stratification of children under the age of 5 years presenting with a fever. These guidelines were later modified in a 2013 update.  
  
It should be noted that these guidelines only apply 'until a clinical diagnosis of the underlying condition has been made'. A link to the guidelines is provided but some key points are listed below.   
  
Assessment
----------

  
The following should be recorded in all febrile children:  
* temperature
* heart rate
* respiratory rate
* capillary refill time

  
Signs of dehydration (reduced skin turgor, cool extremities etc) should also be looked for  
  
Measuring temperature should be done with an electronic thermometer in the axilla if the child is \< 4 weeks or with an electronic/chemical dot thermometer in the axilla or an infra\-red tympanic thermometer.  
  
Risk stratification
-------------------

  
Please see the link for the complete table, below is a modified version  
  


|  | **Green \- low risk** | **Amber \- intermediate risk** | **Red \- high risk** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Colour** | • Normal colour | • Pallor reported by parent/carer | • Pale/mottled/ashen/blue |
| **Activity** | • Responds normally to social cues• Content/smiles• Stays awake or awakens quickly• Strong normal cry/not crying | • Not responding normally to social cues• No smile• Wakes only with prolonged stimulation• Decreased activity | • No response to social cues• Appears ill to a healthcare professional• Does not wake or if roused does not stay awake• Weak, high\-pitched or continuous cry |
| **Respiratory** |  | • Nasal flaring• Tachypnoea: respiratory rate* \>50 breaths/minute, age 6\-12 months; * \>40 breaths/minute, age \>12 months  • Oxygen saturation \<\=95% in air• Crackles in the chest | • Grunting• Tachypnoea: respiratory rate \>60 breaths/minute• Moderate or severe chest indrawing |
| **Circulation and hydration** | • Normal skin and eyes• Moist mucous membranes | • Tachycardia:* \>160 beats/minute, age \<12 months * \>150 beats/minute, age 12\-24 months * \>140 beats/minute, age 2\-5 years  • Capillary refill time \>\=3 seconds• Dry mucous membranes• Poor feeding in infants• Reduced urine output | • Reduced skin turgor |
| **Other** | No amber or red signs | • Age 3\-6 months, temperature \>\=39ºC• Fever for \>\=5 days• Rigors• Swelling of a limb or joint• Non\-weight bearing limb/not using an extremity | • Age \<3 months, temperature \>\=38°C• Non\-blanching rash• Bulging fontanelle• Neck stiffness• Status epilepticus• Focal neurological signs• Focal seizures |

  
Management
----------

  
If green:  
* Child can be managed at home with appropriate care advice, including when to seek further help

  
If amber:  
* provide parents with a safety net or refer to a paediatric specialist for further assessment
* a safety net includes verbal or written information on warning symptoms and how further healthcare can be accessed, a follow\-up appointment, liaison with other healthcare professionals, e.g. out\-of\-hours providers, for further follow\-up

  
If red:  
* refer child urgently to a paediatric specialist

  
Other key points include  
* oral antibiotics should not be prescribed to children with fever without apparent source
* if a pneumonia is suspected but the child is not going to be referred to hospital then a chest x\-ray does not need to be routinely performed
