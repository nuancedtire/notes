Labial adhesions describe the fusion of the labia minora in the midline. It is usually seen in girls between the ages of 3 months and 3 years and can generally be treated conservatively. Spontaneous resolution tends to occur around puberty. It should be noted that the condition is different from an imperforate hymen.  
  
The majority of cases are symptomatic. Features may include:  
* problems with micturition including pooling in the vagina
* on examination thin semitranslucent adhesions covering the vaginal opening between the labia minora are seen, which sometimes cover the vaginal opening completely

  
Management  
* conservative management is appropriate in the majority of cases
* if there are associated problems such as recurrent urinary tract infections oestrogen cream may be tried
* if this fails surgical intervention may be warranted
