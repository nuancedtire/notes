Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital diverticulum of the small intestine. It is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct (also called the vitellointestinal duct) and contains ectopic ileal, gastric or pancreatic mucosa.  
.  
Rule of 2s  
* occurs in 2% of the population
* is 2 feet from the ileocaecal valve
* is 2 inches long

  
Presentation (usually asymptomatic)  
* abdominal pain mimicking appendicitis
* rectal bleeding
	+ Meckel's diverticulum is the most common cause of painless massive GI bleeding requiring a transfusion in children between the ages of 1 and 2 years
* intestinal obstruction
	+ secondary to an omphalomesenteric band (most commonly), volvulus and intussusception

  
Investigation  
* if the child is haemodynamically stable with less severe or intermittent bleeding then a 'Meckel's scan' should be considered
	+ uses 99m technetium pertechnetate, which has an affinity for gastric mucosa
* mesenteric arteriography may also be used in more severe cases e.g. transfusion is required

  
Management  
* removal if narrow neck or symptomatic
	+ options are between wedge excision or formal small bowel resection and anastomosis

  
Pathophysiology  
* normally, in the foetus, there is an attachment between the vitellointestinal duct and the yolk sac. This disappears at 6 weeks gestation
* the tip is free in the majority of cases
* associated with enterocystomas, umbilical sinuses, and omphaloileal fistulas.
* arterial supply: omphalomesenteric artery.
* typically lined by ileal mucosa but ectopic gastric mucosa can occur, with the risk of peptic ulceration. Pancreatic and jejunal mucosa can also occur.
