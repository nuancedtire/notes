Croup is a form of upper respiratory tract infection seen in infants and toddlers. It is characterised by stridor which is caused by a combination of laryngeal oedema and secretions. Parainfluenza viruses account for the majority of cases.  
  
Epidemiology  
* peak incidence at 6 months \- 3 years
* more common in autumn

  
Features  
* cough
	+ barking, seal\-like
	+ worse at night
* stridor
	+ remember, the throat should be not examined due to the risk of precipitating airway obstruction
* fever
* coryzal symptoms
* increased work of breathing e.g. retraction

  
  
Clinical Knowledge Summaries (CKS) suggest using the following criteria to grade the severity:  
  


| **Mild** | **Moderate** | **Severe** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * Occasional barking cough * No audible stridor at rest * No or mild suprasternal and/or intercostal recession * The child is happy and is prepared to eat, drink, and play | * Frequent barking cough * Easily audible stridor at rest * Suprasternal and sternal wall retraction at rest * No or little distress or agitation * The child can be placated and is interested in its surroundings | * Frequent barking cough * Prominent inspiratory (and occasionally, expiratory) stridor at rest * Marked sternal wall retractions * Significant distress and agitation, or lethargy or restlessness (a sign of hypoxaemia) * Tachycardia occurs with more severe obstructive symptoms and hypoxaemia |

  
CKS suggest admitting any child with:  
* moderate or severe croup
* \< 3 months of age
* known upper airway abnormalities (e.g. Laryngomalacia, Down's syndrome)
* uncertainty about diagnosis (important differentials include acute epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, peritonsillar abscess and foreign body inhalation)

  
Investigations  
* the vast majority of children are diagnosed clinically
* however, if a chest x\-ray is done:
	+ a posterior\-anterior view will show subglottic narrowing, commonly called the 'steeple sign'
	+ in contrast, a lateral view in acute epiglottis will show swelling of the epiglottis \- the 'thumb sign'

  
Management  
* CKS recommend giving a single dose of oral dexamethasone (0\.15mg/kg) to all children regardless of severity
* prednisolone is an alternative if dexamethasone is not available

  
Emergency treatment  
* high\-flow oxygen
* nebulised adrenaline
