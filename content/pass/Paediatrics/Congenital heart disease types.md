Acyanotic \- most common causes  
* ventricular septal defects (VSD) \- most common, accounts for 30%
* atrial septal defect (ASD)
* patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
* coarctation of the aorta
* aortic valve stenosis

  
VSDs are more common than ASDs. However, in adult patients ASDs are the more common new diagnosis as they generally presents later.  
  
Cyanotic \- most common causes  
* tetralogy of Fallot
* transposition of the great arteries (TGA)
* tricuspid atresia

  
Fallot's is more common than TGA. However, at birth TGA is the more common lesion as patients with Fallot's generally presenting at around 1\-2 months  
  
The presence of cyanosis in pulmonary valve stenosis depends very much on the severity and any other coexistent defects.
