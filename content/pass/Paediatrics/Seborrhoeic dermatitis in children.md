Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a relatively common skin disorder seen in children. It typically affects the scalp ('Cradle cap'), nappy area, face and limb flexures.  
  
Cradle cap is an early sign which may develop in the first few weeks of life. It is characterised by an erythematous rash with coarse yellow scales.  
  
Management  
* reassurance that it doesn't affect the baby and usually resolves within a few weeks
* massage a topical emollient onto the scalp to loosen scales, brush gently with a soft brush and wash off with shampoo.
* if severe/persistent a topical imidazole cream may be tried

  
Seborrhoeic dermatitis in children tends to resolve spontaneously by around 8 months of age.
