Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is gradually replacing the old term 'congenital dislocation of the hip' (CDH). It affects around 1\-3% of newborns.  
  
Risk factors  
* female sex: 6 times greater risk
* breech presentation
* positive family history
* firstborn children
* oligohydramnios
* birth weight \> 5 kg
* congenital calcaneovalgus foot deformity

  
DDH is slightly more common in the left hip. Around 20% of cases are bilateral.  
  
Screening for DDH  
* the following infants require a routine ultrasound examination
	+ first\-degree family history of hip problems in early life
	+ breech presentation at or after 36 weeks gestation, irrespective of presentation at birth or mode of delivery
	+ multiple pregnancy
* all infants are screened at both the newborn check and also the six\-week baby check using the Barlow and Ortolani tests

  
Clinical examination  
* Barlow test: attempts to dislocate an articulated femoral head
* Ortolani test: attempts to relocate a dislocated femoral head
* other important factors include:
	+ symmetry of leg length
	+ level of knees when hips and knees are bilaterally flexed
	+ restricted abduction of the hip in flexion

  
Imaging  
* ultrasound is generally used to confirm the diagnosis if clinically suspected
* however, if the infant is \> 4\.5 months then x\-ray is the first line investigation

  
Management  
* most unstable hips will spontaneously stabilise by 3\-6 weeks of age
* Pavlik harness (dynamic flexion\-abduction orthosis) in children younger than 4\-5 months
* older children may require surgery
