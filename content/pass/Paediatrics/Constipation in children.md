The frequency at which children open their bowels varies widely but generally decreases with age from a mean of 3 times per day for infants under 6 months old to once a day after 3 years of age.  
  
NICE produced guidelines in 2010 on the diagnosis and management of constipation in children. A diagnosis of constipation is suggested by 2 or more of the following:  
  


|  | **Child \< 1 year** | **Child \> 1 year** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stool pattern** | Fewer than 3 complete stools per week (type 3 or 4 on Bristol Stool Form Scale) (this does not apply to exclusively breastfed babies after 6 weeksof age) Hard large stool 'Rabbit droppings' (type 1\) | Fewer than 3 complete stools per week (type 3 or 4\) Overflow soiling (commonly very loose, very smelly, stool passed without sensation) 'Rabbit droppings' (type 1\) Large, infrequent stools that can block the toilet |
| **Symptoms associated with defecation** | Distress on passing stool Bleeding associated with hard stool Straining | Poor appetite that improves with passage of large stool Waxing and waning of abdominal pain with passage of stool Evidence of retentive posturing: typical straight\-legged, tiptoed, back archingposture Straining Anal pain |
| **History** | Previous episode(s) of constipation Previous or current anal fissure | Previous episode(s) of constipation Previous or current anal fissure Painful bowel movements and bleeding associated with hard stools |

  
The vast majority of children have no identifiable cause \- idiopathic constipation. Other causes of constipation in children include:  
* dehydration
* low\-fibre diet
* medications: e.g. Opiates
* anal fissure
* over\-enthusiastic potty training
* hypothyroidism
* Hirschsprung's disease
* hypercalcaemia
* learning disabilities

  
  
After making a diagnosis of constipation NICE then suggesting excluding secondary causes. If no red or amber flags are present then a diagnosis of idiopathic constipation can be made:  
  


|  | **Indicates idiopathic constipation** | **'Red flag' suggesting underlying disorder** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Timing** | Starts after a few weeks of life Obvious precipitating factors coinciding with the start of symptoms: fissure, change of diet, timing of potty/toilet training or acute events such as infections, moving house, starting nursery/school, fears and phobias, major change in family, taking medicines | Reported from birth or first few weeks of life |
| **Passage of meconium** | \< 48 hours | \> 48 hours |
| **Stool pattern** |  | 'Ribbon' stools |
| **Growth** | Generally well, weight and height within normal limits, fit and active | Faltering growth is an **amber** flag |
| **Neuro/locomotor** | No neurological problems in legs, normal locomotor development | Previously unknown or undiagnosed weakness in legs, locomotor delay |
| **Abdomen** |  | Distension |
| **Diet** | Changes in infant formula, weaning, insufficient fluid intake or poor diet |  |
| **Other** |  | **Amber** flag: Disclosure or evidence that raises concerns over possibility of child maltreatment |

  
Prior to starting treatment, the child needs to be assessed for faecal impaction. Factors which suggest faecal impaction include:  
* symptoms of severe constipation
* overflow soiling
* faecal mass palpable in the abdomen (digital rectal examination should only be carried out by a specialist)

  
NICE guidelines on management
-----------------------------

  
If faecal impaction is present  
* polyethylene glycol 3350 \+ electrolytes (Movicol Paediatric Plain) using an escalating dose regimen as the first\-line treatment
* add a stimulant laxative if Movicol Paediatric Plain does not lead to disimpaction after 2 weeks
* substitute a stimulant laxative singly or in combination with an osmotic laxative such as lactulose if Movicol Paediatric Plain is not tolerated
* inform families that disimpaction treatment can initially increase symptoms of soiling and abdominal pain

  
Maintenance therapy  
* very similar to the above regime, with obvious adjustments to the starting dose, i.e.
* first\-line: Movicol Paediatric Plain
* add a stimulant laxative if no response
* substitute a stimulant laxative if Movicol Paediatric Plain is not tolerated. Add another laxative such as lactulose or docusate if stools are hard
* continue medication at maintenance dose for several weeks after regular bowel habit is established, then reduce the dose gradually

  
General points  
* do not use dietary interventions alone as first\-line treatment although ensure the child is having adequate fluid and fibre intake
* consider regular toileting and non\-punitive behavioural interventions
* for all children consider asking the Health Visitor or Paediatric Continence Advisor to help support the parents.

  
The NICE guidelines do not specifically discuss the management of a very young child. The following recommendations are largely based on the old Clinical Knowledge Summaries recommendations.   
  
Infants not yet weaned (usually \< 6 months)  
* bottle\-fed infants: give extra water in between feeds. Try gentle abdominal massage and bicycling the infant's legs
* breast\-fed infants: constipation is unusual and organic causes should be considered

  
Infants who have or are being weaned  
* offer extra water, diluted fruit juice and fruits
* if not effective consider adding lactulose
