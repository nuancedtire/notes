A common presentation in General Practice is a child complaining of pain in the legs with no obvious cause. Such presentations, in the absence of any worrying features, are often attributed to 'growing pains'. This is a misnomer as the pains are often not related to growth \- the current term used in rheumatology is 'benign idiopathic nocturnal limb pains of childhood'  
  
Growing pains are equally common in boys and girls and occur in the age range of 3\-12 years.  
  
Features of growing pains  
* never present at the start of the day after the child has woken
* no limp
* no limitation of physical activity
* systemically well
* normal physical examination
* motor milestones normal
* symptoms are often intermittent and worse after a day of vigorous activity
