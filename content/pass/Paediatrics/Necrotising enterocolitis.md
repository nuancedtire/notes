Necrotising enterocolitis is one of the leading causes of death among premature infants. Initial symptoms can include feeding intolerance, abdominal distension and bloody stools, which can quickly progress to abdominal discolouration, perforation and peritonitis.   
  
Abdominal x\-rays are useful when diagnosing necrotising enterocolitis, as they can show:  
* dilated bowel loops (often asymmetrical in distribution)
* bowel wall oedema
* pneumatosis intestinalis (intramural gas)
* portal venous gas
* pneumoperitoneum resulting from perforation
* air both inside and outside of the bowel wall (Rigler sign)
* air outlining the falciform ligament (football sign)
