Trinucleotide repeat disorders are genetic conditions caused by an abnormal number of repeats (expansions) of a repetitive sequence of three nucleotides. These expansions are unstable and may enlarge which may lead to an earlier age of onset in successive generations \- a phenomenon known as anticipation\*. In most cases, an increase in the severity of symptoms is also noted  
  
Examples \- note dominance of neurological disorders  
* Fragile X (CGG)
* Huntington's (CAG)
* myotonic dystrophy (CTG)
* Friedreich's ataxia\* (GAA)
* spinocerebellar ataxia
* spinobulbar muscular atrophy
* dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy

  
\*Friedreich's ataxia is unusual in not demonstrating anticipation
