Meconium aspiration syndrome refers to respiratory distress in the newborn as a result of meconium in the trachea. It occurs in the immediate neonatal period. It is more common in post\-term deliveries, with rates of up to 44% reported in babies born after 42 weeks. It causes respiratory distress, which can be severe. Higher rates occur where there is a history of maternal hypertension, pre\-eclampsia, chorioamnionitis, smoking or substance abuse.
