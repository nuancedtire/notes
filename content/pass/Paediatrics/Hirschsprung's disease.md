Hirschsprung's disease is caused by an aganglionic segment of bowel due to a developmental failure of the parasympathetic Auerbach and Meissner plexuses. Although rare (occurring in 1 in 5,000 births) it is an important differential diagnosis in childhood constipation.  
  
Pathophysiology  
* parasympathetic neuroblasts fail to migrate from the neural crest to the distal colon → developmental failure of the parasympathetic Auerbach and Meissner plexuses → uncoordinated peristalsis → functional obstruction

  
Associations  
* 3 times more common in males
* Down's syndrome

  
Possible presentations  
* neonatal period e.g. failure or delay to pass meconium
* older children: constipation, abdominal distension

  
Investigations  
* abdominal x\-ray
* rectal biopsy: gold standard for diagnosis

  
Management  
* initially: rectal washouts/bowel irrigation
* definitive management: surgery to affected segment of the colon
