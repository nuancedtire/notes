Benign rolandic epilepsy is a form of childhood epilepsy that typically occurs between the age of 4 and 12 years.  
  
Features  
* seizures characteristically occur at night
* seizures are typically partial (e.g. paraesthesia affecting the face) but secondary generalisation may occur (i.e. parents may only report tonic\-clonic movements)
* the child is otherwise normal

  
EEG characteristically shows centrotemporal spikes  
  
The prognosis is excellent, with seizures stopping by adolescence
