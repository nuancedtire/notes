The General Medical Council have produced guidelines on obtaining consent in children:  
* at 16 years or older a young person can be treated as an adult and can be presumed to have capacity to decide
* under the age of 16 years children may have capacity to decide, depending on their ability to understand what is involved
* where a competent child refuses treatment, a person with parental responsibility or the court may authorise investigation or treatment which is in the child's best interests\*

  
With regards to the provision of contraceptives to patients under 16 years of age the Fraser Guidelines state that all the following requirements should be fulfilled:  
* the young person understands the professional's advice
* the young person cannot be persuaded to inform their parents
* the young person is likely to begin, or to continue having, sexual intercourse with or without contraceptive treatment
* unless the young person receives contraceptive treatment, their physical or mental health, or both, are likely to suffer
* the young person's best interests require them to receive contraceptive advice or treatment with or without parental consent

  
Gillick or Fraser?

Some doctors use the term Fraser competency when referring to contraception and Gillick competency when referring to general issues of consent in children. The (widespread) rumours that Victoria Gillick removed her permission to use her name or applied copyright have recently been debunked.
