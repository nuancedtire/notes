Newborn babies are relatively deficient in vitamin K. This may result in impaired production of clotting factors which in turn can lead to haemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN). Bleeding may range from minor bruising to intracranial haemorrhages  
  
Breast\-fed babies are particularly at risk as breast milk is a poor source of vitamin K. Maternal use of antiepileptics also increases the risk  
  
Because of this, all newborns in the UK are offered vitamin K, either intramuscularly or orally
