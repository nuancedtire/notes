Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) is the commonest cause of respiratory distress in the newborn period. It is caused by delayed resorption of fluid in the lungs  
  
It is more common following caesarean sections, possibly due to the lung fluid not being 'squeezed out' during the passage through the birth canal  
  
Chest x\-ray may show hyperinflation of the lungs and fluid in the horizontal fissure.  
  
Management  
* observation, supportive care
* supplementary oxygen may be required to maintain oxygen saturations

  
Transient tachypnoea of the newborn usually settles within 1\-2 days
