Perthes' disease is a degenerative condition affecting the hip joints of children, typically between the ages of 4\-8 years. It is due to avascular necrosis of the femoral head, specifically the femoral epiphysis. Impaired blood supply to the femoral head causes bone infarction.   
  
Perthes' disease is 5 times more common in boys. Around 10% of cases are bilateral  
  
Features  
* hip pain: develops progressively over a few weeks
* limp
* stiffness and reduced range of hip movement
* x\-ray: early changes include widening of joint space, later changes include decreased femoral head size/flattening

  
Diagnosis  
* plain x\-ray
* technetium bone scan or magnetic resonance imaging if normal x\-ray and symptoms persist

  
Complications  
* osteoarthritis
* premature fusion of the growth plates

Catterall staging  
  


| **Stage** | **Features** |
| --- | --- |
| Stage 1 | Clinical and histological features only |
| Stage 2 | Sclerosis with or without cystic changes and preservation of the articular surface |
| Stage 3 | Loss of structural integrity of the femoral head |
| Stage 4 | Loss of acetabular integrity |

  
Management  
* To keep the femoral head within the acetabulum: cast, braces
* If less than 6 years: observation
* Older: surgical management with moderate results
* Operate on severe deformities

  
Prognosis  
* Most cases will resolve with conservative management. Early diagnosis improves outcomes.
