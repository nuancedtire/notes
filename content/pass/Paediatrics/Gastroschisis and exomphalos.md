Gastroschisis and exomphalos are both examples of congenital visceral malformations.  
  
  
Gastroschisis
-------------

  
Gastroschisis describes a congenital defect in the anterior abdominal wall just lateral to the umbilical cord.  
  
Management  
* vaginal delivery may be attempted
* newborns should go to theatre as soon as possible after delivery, e.g. within 4 hours

  
  
Exomphalos (omphalocoele)
-------------------------

  
In exomphalos (also known as an omphalocoele) the abdominal contents protrude through the anterior abdominal wall but are covered in an amniotic sac formed by amniotic membrane and peritoneum.  
  
Associations  
* Beckwith\-Wiedemann syndrome
* Down's syndrome
* cardiac and kidney malformations

  
Management  
* caesarean section is indicated to reduce the risk of sac rupture
* a staged repair may be undertaken as primary closure may be difficult due to lack of space/high intra\-abdominal pressure
	+ if this occurs the sacs is allowed to granulate and epithelialise over the coming weeks/months
	+ this forms a 'shell'
	+ as the infant grows a point will be reached when the sac contents can fit within the abdominal cavity. At this point the shell will be removed and the abdomen closed
