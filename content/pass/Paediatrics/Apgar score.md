The Apgar score is used to assess the health of a newborn baby. NICE recommend that it is assessed at 1, and 5 minutes of age. If the score is low then it is again repeated at 10 minutes.  
  


| **Score** | **Pulse** | **Respiratory effort** | **Colour** | **Muscle tone** | **Reflex irritability** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | \> 100 | Strong, crying | Pink | Active movement | Cries on stimulation/sneezes, coughs |
| 1 | \< 100 | Weak, irregular | Body pink, extremities blue | Limb flexion | Grimace |
| 0 | Absent | Nil | Blue all over | Flaccid | Nil |

  
A score of 0\-3 is very low score, between 4\-6 is moderate low and between 7 \- 10 means the baby is in a good state
