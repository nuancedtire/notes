Eczema occurs in around 15\-20% of children and is becoming more common. It typically presents before 2 years but clears in around 50% of children by 5 years of age and in 75% of children by 10 years of age  
  
Features  
* itchy, erythematous rash
	+ repeated scratching may exacerbate affected areas
* in infants the face and trunk are often affected
* in younger children, eczema often occurs on the extensor surfaces
* in older children, a more typical distribution is seen, with flexor surfaces affected and the creases of the face and neck

  
Management  
* avoid irritants
* simple emollients
	+ large quantities should be prescribed (e.g. 250g / week), roughly in a ratio of with topical steroids of 10:1
	+ if a topical steroid is also being used the emollient should be applied first followed by waiting at least 30 minutes before applying the topical steroid
	+ creams soak into the skin faster than ointments
	+ emollients can become contaminated with bacteria \- fingers should not be inserted into pots (many brands have pump dispensers)
* topical steroids
* wet wrapping
	+ large amounts of emollient (and sometimes topical steroids) applied under wet bandages
* in severe cases, oral ciclosporin may be used
