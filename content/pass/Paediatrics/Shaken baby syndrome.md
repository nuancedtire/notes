This syndrome encompasses the triad of retinal haemorrhages, subdural haematoma, and encephalopathy. This is caused by the intentional shaking of a child (0\-5 years old). The diagnosis of shaken baby syndrome has often made the headlines due to the controversy amongst physicians as to whether the mechanism of injury is definitely an intentional shaking of a child. This has often resulted in difficulty for the courts to convict suspects of causing shaken baby syndrome to a child.
