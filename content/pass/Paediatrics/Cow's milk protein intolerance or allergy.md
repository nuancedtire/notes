Cow's milk protein intolerance/allergy (CMPI/CMPA) occurs in around 3\-6% of all children and typically presents in the first 3 months of life in formula\-fed infants, although rarely it is seen in exclusively breastfed infants.   
  
Both immediate (IgE mediated) and delayed (non\-IgE mediated) reactions are seen. The term CMPA is usually used for immediate reactions and CMPI for mild\-moderate delayed reactions.  
  
Features  
* regurgitation and vomiting
* diarrhoea
* urticaria, atopic eczema
* 'colic' symptoms: irritability, crying
* wheeze, chronic cough
* rarely angioedema and anaphylaxis may occur

  
Diagnosis is often clinical (e.g. improvement with cow's milk protein elimination). Investigations include:  
* skin prick/patch testing
* total IgE and specific IgE (RAST) for cow's milk protein

  
Management
----------

  
If the symptoms are severe (e.g. failure to thrive) refer to a paediatrician.  
  
Management if formula\-fed  
* extensive hydrolysed formula (eHF) milk is the first\-line replacement formula for infants with mild\-moderate symptoms
* amino acid\-based formula (AAF) in infants with severe CMPA or if no response to eHF
* around 10% of infants are also intolerant to soya milk

  
Management if breastfed  
* continue breastfeeding
* eliminate cow's milk protein from maternal diet. Consider prescribing calcium supplements for breastfeeding mothers whose babies have, or are suspected to have, CMPI, to prevent deficiency whilst they exclude dairy from their diet
* use eHF milk when breastfeeding stops, until 12 months of age and at least for 6 months

  
Prognosis
---------

  
CMPI usually resolves in most children  
* in children with IgE mediated intolerance around 55% will be milk tolerant by the age of 5 years
* in children with non\-IgE mediated intolerance most children will be milk tolerant by the age of 3 years
* a challenge is often performed in the hospital setting as anaphylaxis can occur.
