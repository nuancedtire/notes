One of the best ways to differentiate between acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is renal ultrasound \- most patients with CKD have bilateral small kidneys. Exceptions to this rule include:  
* autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
* diabetic nephropathy (early stages)
* amyloidosis
* HIV\-associated nephropathy

  
Other features suggesting CKD rather than AKI  
* hypocalcaemia (due to lack of vitamin D)
