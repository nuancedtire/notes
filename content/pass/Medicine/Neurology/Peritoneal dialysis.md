Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a form of renal replacement therapy. It is sometimes used as a stop\-gap to haemodialysis or for younger patients who do not want to have to visit hospital three times a week.  
  
The majority of patients do Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD), which involves four 2\-litre exchanges/day.  
  
Complications  
* peritonitis
	+ coagulase\-negative staphylococci such as *Staphylococcus epidermidis* is the most common cause. *Staphylococcus aureus* is another common cause
	+ antibiotics should cover both Gram positive and Gram negative organisms
	+ the BNF recommends vancomycin (or teicoplanin) \+ ceftazidime added to dialysis fluid OR vancomycin added to dialysis fluid \+ ciprofloxacin by mouth
	+ aminoglycosides are sometimes used to cover the Gram negative organisms instead of ceftazidime
* sclerosing peritonitis
