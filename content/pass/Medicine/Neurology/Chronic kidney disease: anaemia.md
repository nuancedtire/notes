Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) may develop anaemia due to a variety of factors, the most significant of which is reduced erythropoietin levels. This is usually a normochromic normocytic anaemia and becomes apparent when the GFR is less than 35 ml/min (other causes of anaemia should be considered if the GFR is \> 60 ml/min). Anaemia in CKD predisposes to the development of left ventricular hypertrophy \- associated with a three fold increase in mortality in renal patients  
  
Causes of anaemia in renal failure  
* reduced erythropoietin levels
	+ the most significant factor in CKD causing anaemia
	+ CKD is associated with a decrease in the production of erythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates erythropoiesis in the bone marrow
	+ reduced erythropoietin levels → diminished red blood cell production
* reduced absorption of iron
	+ hepcidin is an acute\-phase reactant
	+ in CKD, hepcidin levels are often increased due to inflammation and reduced renal clearance
	+ elevated hepcidin levels lead to decreased iron absorption from the gut and impaired release of stored iron from macrophages and hepatocytes, reducing the iron available for erythropoiesis
	+ additionally, metabolic acidosis, a common condition in CKD, can inhibit the conversion of ferric iron (Fe³º) to its absorbable form, ferrous iron (Fe²º), in the duodenum → reduced iron absorption.
* reduced erythropoiesis due to toxic effects of uraemia on bone marrow
* anorexia/nausea due to uraemia
* reduced red cell survival (especially in haemodialysis)
* blood loss due to capillary fragility and poor platelet function
* stress ulceration leading to chronic blood loss

  
Management  
* the 2011 NICE guidelines suggest a target haemoglobin of 10 \- 12 g/dl
* determination and optimisation of iron status should be carried out prior to the administration of erythropoiesis\-stimulating agents (ESA).
	+ oral iron should be offered for patients who are not on ESAs or haemodialysis. If target Hb levels are not reached within 3 months then patients should be switched to IV iron
	+ patients on ESAs or haemodialysis generally require IV iron
* ESAs such as erythropoietin and darbepoetin should be used in those 'who are likely to benefit in terms of quality of life and physical function'
