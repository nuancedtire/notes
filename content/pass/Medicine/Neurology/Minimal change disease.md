Minimal change disease nearly always presents as nephrotic syndrome, accounting for 75% of cases in children and 25% in adults.  
  
The majority of cases are idiopathic, but in around 10\-20% a cause is found:  
* drugs: NSAIDs, rifampicin
* Hodgkin's lymphoma, thymoma
* infectious mononucleosis

  
Pathophysiology  
* T\-cell and cytokine\-mediated damage to the glomerular basement membrane → polyanion loss
* the resultant reduction of electrostatic charge → increased glomerular permeability to serum albumin

  
Features  
* nephrotic syndrome
* normotension \- hypertension is rare
* highly selective proteinuria
	+ only intermediate\-sized proteins such as albumin and transferrin leak through the glomerulus
* renal biopsy
	+ normal glomeruli on light microscopy
	+ electron microscopy shows fusion of podocytes and effacement of foot processes

  
Management  
* oral corticosteroids: majority of cases (80%) are steroid\-responsive
* cyclophosphamide is the next step for steroid\-resistant cases

  
Prognosis is overall good, although relapse is common. Roughly:  
* 1/3 have just one episode
* 1/3 have infrequent relapses
* 1/3 have frequent relapses which stop before adulthood
