Henoch\-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is an IgA mediated small vessel vasculitis. There is a degree of overlap with IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease). HSP is usually seen in children following an infection.  
  
Features  
* palpable purpuric rash (with localized oedema) over buttocks and extensor surfaces of arms and legs
* abdominal pain
* polyarthritis
* features of IgA nephropathy may occur e.g. haematuria, renal failure

  
Treatment  
* analgesia for arthralgia
* treatment of nephropathy is generally supportive. There is inconsistent evidence for the use of steroids and immunosuppressants

  
Prognosis  
* usually excellent, HSP is a self\-limiting condition, especially in children without renal involvement
* blood pressure and urinanalysis should be monitored to detect progressive renal involvement
* around 1/3rd of patients have a relapse
