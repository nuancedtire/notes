Rhabdomyolysis will typically feature in the exam as a patient who has had a fall or prolonged epileptic seizure and is found to have an acute kidney injury on admission.  
  
Causes  
* seizure
* collapse/coma (e.g. elderly patient collapses at home, found 8 hours later)
* ecstasy
* crush injury
* McArdle's syndrome
* drugs: statins (especially if co\-prescribed with clarithromycin)

  
Features  
* acute kidney injury with disproportionately raised creatinine
* elevated creatine kinase (CK)
	+ the CK is significantly elevated, at least 5 times the upper limit of normal
	+ elevations of CK that are 'only' 2\-4 times that of normal are not supportive of a diagnosis and suggest another underlying pathophysiology
* myoglobinuria: dark or reddish\-brown colour
* hypocalcaemia (myoglobin binds calcium)
* elevated phosphate (released from myocytes)
* hyperkalaemia (may develop before renal failure)
* metabolic acidosis

  
Management  
* IV fluids to maintain good urine output
* urinary alkalinization is sometimes used
