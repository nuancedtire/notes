Example regime  
* initial: ciclosporin/tacrolimus with a monoclonal antibody
* maintenance: ciclosporin/tacrolimus with MMF or sirolimus
* add steroids if more than one steroid responsive acute rejection episode

  
Ciclosporin  
* inhibits calcineurin, a phosphotase involved in T cell activation

  
Tacrolimus  
* lower incidence of acute rejection compared to ciclosporin
* also less hypertension and hyperlipidaemia
* however, high incidence of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes

  
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)  
* blocks purine synthesis by inhibition of IMPDH
* therefore inhibits proliferation of B and T cells
* side\-effects: GI and marrow suppression

  
Sirolimus (rapamycin)  
* blocks T cell proliferation by blocking the IL\-2 receptor
* can cause hyperlipidaemia

  
Monoclonal antibodies  
* selective inhibitors of IL\-2 receptor
* daclizumab
* basilximab

  
  
Monitoring
----------

  
Patients on long\-term immunosuppression for organ transplantation require regular monitoring for complications such as:  
  
Cardiovascular disease \- tacrolimus and ciclosporin can cause hypertension and hyperglycaemia. Tacrolimus can also cause hyperlipidaemia. Patients must be monitored for accelerated cardiovascular disease.   
  
Renal failure \- due to nephrotoxic effects of tacrolimus and ciclosporin/graft rejection/recurrence of original disease in transplanted kidney  
  
Malignancy \- patients should be educated about minimising sun exposure to reduce the risk of squamous cell carcinomas and basal cell carcinomas
