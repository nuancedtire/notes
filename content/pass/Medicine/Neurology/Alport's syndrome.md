Alport's syndrome is usually inherited in an X\-linked dominant pattern\*. It is due to a defect in the gene which codes for type IV collagen resulting in an abnormal glomerular\-basement membrane (GBM). The disease is more severe in males with females rarely developing renal failure.  
  
A favourite question is an Alport's patient with a failing renal transplant. This may be caused by the presence of anti\-GBM antibodies leading to a Goodpasture's syndrome like picture.  
  
Alport's syndrome usually presents in childhood. The following features may be seen:  
* microscopic haematuria
* progressive renal failure
* bilateral sensorineural deafness
* lenticonus: protrusion of the lens surface into the anterior chamber
* retinitis pigmentosa
* renal biopsy: splitting of lamina densa seen on electron microscopy

  
Diagnosis  
* molecular genetic testing
* renal biopsy
	+ electron microscopy: characteristic finding is of the longitudinal splitting of the lamina densa of the glomerular basement membrane, resulting in a 'basket\-weave' appearance

  
\*in around 85% of cases \- 10\-15% of cases are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion with rare autosomal dominant variants existing
