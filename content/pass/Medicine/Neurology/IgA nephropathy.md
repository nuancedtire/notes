IgA nephropathy (also known as Berger's disease) is the commonest cause of glomerulonephritis worldwide. It classically presents as macroscopic haematuria in young people following an upper respiratory tract infection.   
  
Associated conditions  
* alcoholic cirrhosis
* coeliac disease/dermatitis herpetiformis
* Henoch\-Schonlein purpura

  
Pathophysiology  
* thought to be caused by mesangial deposition of IgA immune complexes
* there is considerable pathological overlap with Henoch\-Schonlein purpura (HSP)
* histology: mesangial hypercellularity, positive immunofluorescence for IgA \& C3

  
Presentations  
* young male, recurrent episodes of macroscopic haematuria
* typically associated with a recent respiratory tract infection
* nephrotic range proteinuria is rare
* renal failure is unusual and seen in a minority of patients

  
Differentiating between IgA nephropathy and post\-streptococcal glomerulonephritis  
* post\-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is associated with low complement levels
* main symptom in post\-streptococcal glomerulonephritis is proteinuria (although haematuria can occur)
* there is typically an interval between URTI and the onset of renal problems in post\-streptococcal glomerulonephritis

Management  
* isolated hematuria, no or minimal proteinuria (less than 500 to 1000 mg/day), and a normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
	+ no treatment needed, other than follow\-up to check renal function
* persistent proteinuria (above 500 to 1000 mg/day), a normal or only slightly reduced GFR
	+ initial treatment is with ACE inhibitors
* if there is active disease (e.g. falling GFR) or failure to respond to ACE inhibitors
	+ immunosuppression with corticosteroids

  
Prognosis  
* 25% of patients develop ESRF
* markers of good prognosis: frank haematuria
* markers of poor prognosis: male gender, proteinuria (especially \> 2 g/day), hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidaemia, ACE genotype DD
