Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a condition characterised by either a decreased secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the pituitary (cranial DI) or an insensitivity to antidiuretic hormone (nephrogenic DI).  
  
Causes of cranial DI  
* idiopathic
* post head injury
* pituitary surgery
* craniopharyngiomas
* infiltrative
	+ histiocytosis X
	+ sarcoidosis
* DIDMOAD is the association of cranial Diabetes Insipidus, Diabetes Mellitus, Optic Atrophy and Deafness (also known as Wolfram's syndrome)
* haemochromatosis

  
Causes of nephrogenic DI  
* genetic:
	+ more common form affects the vasopression (ADH) receptor
	+ less common form results from a mutation in the gene that encodes the aquaporin 2 channel
* electrolytes
	+ hypercalcaemia
	+ hypokalaemia
* lithium
	+ lithium desensitizes the kidney's ability to respond to ADH in the collecting ducts
* demeclocycline
* tubulo\-interstitial disease: obstruction, sickle\-cell, pyelonephritis

  
Features  
* polyuria
* polydipsia

  
Investigation  
* high plasma osmolality, low urine osmolality
* a urine osmolality of \>700 mOsm/kg excludes diabetes insipidus
* water deprivation test

  
Management  
* nephrogenic diabetes insipidus
	+ thiazides
	+ low salt/protein diet
* central diabetes insipidus can be treated with desmopressin
