Haemolytic uraemic syndrome is generally seen in young children and produces a triad of:  
* acute kidney injury
* microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia
* thrombocytopenia

  
Most cases are secondary (termed 'typical HUS'):  
* classically Shiga toxin\-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) 0157:H7
	+ 'verotoxigenic', 'enterohaemorrhagic'
	+ this is the most common cause in children, accounting for over 90% of cases
* pneumococcal infection
* HIV
* rare: systemic lupus erythematosus, drugs, cancer

  
Primary HUS ('atypical') is due to complement dysregulation.  
  
Investigations  
* full blood count
	+ anaemia: microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia characterised by a haemoglobin level less than 8 g/dL with a negative Coomb's test
	+ thrombocytopenia
	+ fragmented blood film: schistocytes and helmet cells
* U\&E: acute kidney injury
* stool culture
	+ looking for evidence of STEC infection
	+ PCR for Shiga toxins

Management  
* treatment is supportive e.g. Fluids, blood transfusion and dialysis if required
* there is no role for antibiotics, despite the preceding diarrhoeal illness in many patients
* the indications for plasma exchange in HUS are complicated
	+ as a general rule plasma exchange is reserved for severe cases of HUS not associated with diarrhoea
* eculizumab (a C5 inhibitor monoclonal antibody) has evidence of greater efficiency than plasma exchange alone in the treatment of adult atypical HUS
