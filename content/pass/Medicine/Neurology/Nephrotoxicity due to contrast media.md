Contrast media nephrotoxicity may be defined as a 25% increase in creatinine occurring within 3 days of the intravascular administration of contrast media. Contrast\-induced nephropathy occurs 2 \-5 days after administration.  
  
Risk factors include  
* known renal impairment (especially diabetic nephropathy)
* age \> 70 years
* dehydration
* cardiac failure
* the use of nephrotoxic drugs such as NSAIDs

  
Examples of procedures that may cause contrast\-induced nephropathy includes:  
* CT with contrast
* coronary angiography/percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
	+ around 5% of patients who've undergone PCI develop a transient rise in the plasma creatinine concentration of more than 88 Âµmol/L

  
Prevention  
* the evidence base currently supports the use of intravenous 0\.9% sodium chloride at a rate of 1 mL/kg/hour for 12 hours pre\- and post\- procedure. There is also evidence to support the use of isotonic sodium bicarbonate
* N\-acetylcysteine has been given in the past but recent evidence suggests it is not effective\*

  
Patients who are high\-risk for contrast\-induced nephropathy should have metformin withheld for a minimum of 48 hours and until the renal function has been shown to be normal. This is due to the risk of lactic acidosis.
