Untreated hyperkalaemia may cause life\-threatening arrhythmias. Precipitating factors should be addressed (e.g. acute kidney injury) and aggravating drugs stopped (e.g. ACE inhibitors). Management may be categorised by the aims of treatment  
  
Staging
-------

  
The European Resuscitation Council classifies hyperkalaemia as:  
* mild: 5\.5 \- 5\.9 mmol/L
* moderate: 6\.0 \- 6\.4 mmol/L
* severe: ≥ 6\.5 mmol/L

  
Remember that the presence of ECG changes is important in determining the management \- it should be done in all patients with new hyperkalaemia. The following changes are associated with hyperkalaemia:  
* peaked or 'tall\-tented' T waves (occurs first)
* loss of P waves
* broad QRS complexes
* sinusoidal wave pattern

Management
----------

  
### Principles of treatment modalities

  
Stabilisation of the cardiac membrane  
* IV calcium gluconate
	+ does NOT lower serum potassium levels

  
Short\-term shift in potassium from extracellular (ECF) to intracellular fluid (ICF)   
compartment  
* combined insulin/dextrose infusion
* nebulised salbutamol

  
Removal of potassium from the body  
* calcium resonium (orally or enema)
	+ enemas are more effective than oral as potassium is secreted by the rectum
* loop diuretics
* dialysis
	+ haemofiltration/haemodialysis should be considered for patients with AKI with persistent hyperkalaemia

  
### Outline of practical treatment

  
All patients with severe hyperkalaemia (≥ 6\.5 mmol/L) or with ECG changes should have emergency treatment  
* **IV calcium gluconate**: to stabilise the myocardium
* **insulin/dextrose infusion**: short\-term shift in potassium from ECF to ICF
* other treatments such as nebulised salbutamol may be given to temporarily lower the serum potassium

  
Further management  
* stop exacerbating drugs e.g. ACE inhibitors
* treat any underlying cause
* lower total body potassium
	+ calcium resonium
	+ loop diuretics
	+ dialysis
