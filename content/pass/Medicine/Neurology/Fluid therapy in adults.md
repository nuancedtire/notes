The prescription of intravenous fluids is one of the most common tasks that junior doctors need to do.   
  
In the 2013 guidelines NICE recommend the following requirements for maintenance fluids:  
* 25\-30 ml/kg/day of water and
* approximately 1 mmol/kg/day of potassium, sodium and chloride and
* approximately 50\-100 g/day of glucose to limit starvation ketosis

  
So, for a 80kg patient, for a 24 hour period, this would translate to:  
* 2 litres of water
* 80mmol potassium

  
For the first 24 hours NICE recommend the following::  
 **When prescribing for routine maintenance alone, consider using 25\-30 ml/kg/day sodium chloride 0\.18% in 4% glucose with 27 mmol/l potassium on day 1 (there are other regimens to achieve this).**  
The amount of fluid patients require obviously varies according to their recent and past medical history. For example a patient who is post\-op and is having significant losses from drains will require more fluid whereas a patient with heart failure should be given less fluid to avoid precipitating pulmonary oedema.  
  
The table below shows the electrolyte concentrations (in millimoles/litre) of plasma and the most commonly used fluids:  
  


|  | **Na\+** | **Cl\-** | **K\+** | **HCO3\-** | Glucose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Plasma** | 135\-145 | 98\-105 | 3\.5\-5 | 22\-28 | \- |
| **0\.9% saline** | 154 | 154 | \- | \- | \- |
| **5% glucose** | \- | \- | \- | \- | 50g |
| **0\.18% saline with 4% glucose** | 30 | 30 | \- | \- | 40g |
| **Hartmann's solution** | 131 | 111 | 5 | 29 | \- |

  
  
Specific points
---------------

  
0\.9% saline  
* if large volumes are used there is an increased risk of hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis

  
Hartmann's  
* contains potassium and therefore should not be used in patients with hyperkalaemia
