Metabolic acidosis is commonly classified according to the anion gap. This can be calculated by: (Na\+ \+ K\+) \- (Cl\- \+ HCO\-3). If a question supplies the chloride level then this is often a clue that the anion gap should be calculated. The normal range \= 10\-18 mmol/L  
  
Normal anion gap ( \= hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis)  
* gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss:
	+ prolonged diarrhoea: may also result in hypokalaemia
	+ ureterosigmoidostomy
	+ fistula
* renal tubular acidosis
* drugs: e.g. acetazolamide
* ammonium chloride injection
* Addison's disease

  
Raised anion gap  
* lactate:
	+ shock
	+ sepsis
	+ hypoxia
* ketones:
	+ diabetic ketoacidosis
	+ alcohol
* urate: renal failure
* acid poisoning: salicylates, methanol

  
Metabolic acidosis secondary to high lactate levels may be subdivided into two types:  
* lactic acidosis type A: sepsis, shock, hypoxia, burns
* lactic acidosis type B: metformin
