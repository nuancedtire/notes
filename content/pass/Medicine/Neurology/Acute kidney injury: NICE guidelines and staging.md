This guideline discuss what increases the risk of AKI:  
* Emergency surgery, ie, risk of sepsis or hypovolaemia
* Intraperitoneal surgery
* CKD, ie if eGFR \< 60
* Diabetes
* Heart failure
* Age \>65 years
* Liver disease
* Use of nephrotoxic drugs
	+ NSAIDs
	+ aminoglycosides
	+ ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor antagonists
	+ diuretics

  
Diagnostic criteria
-------------------

  
It also defines the criteria for diagnosing AKI  
* Rise in creatinine of 26µmol/L or more in 48 hours OR
* \>\= 50% rise in creatinine over 7 days OR
* Fall in urine output to \< 0\.5ml/kg/hour for more than 6 hours in adults (8 hours in children) OR
* \>\= 25% fall in eGFR in children / young adults in 7 days.

  
Staging criteria
----------------

  
The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria are widely used to stage the AKI:  
  


| **Stage 1** | Increase in creatinine to **1\.5\-1\.9** times baseline, orIncrease in creatinine by ≥26\.5 µmol/L, orReduction in urine output to **\<0\.5** mL/kg/hour for **≥ 6 hours** |
| --- | --- |
| **Stage 2** | Increase in creatinine to **2\.0 to 2\.9** times baseline, or Reduction in urine output to **\<0\.5** mL/kg/hour for **≥12 hours** |
| **Stage 3** | Increase in creatinine to **≥ 3\.0** times baseline, or Increase in creatinine to ≥353\.6 µmol/L or Reduction in urine output to **\<0\.3** mL/kg/hour for **≥24 hours**, or The initiation of kidney replacement therapy, or, In patients \<18 years, decrease in eGFR to \<35 mL/min/1\.73 m2 |

  
Referral criteria
-----------------

  
Refer to a nephrologist if any of the following apply:  
* Renal tranplant
* ITU patient with unknown cause of AKI
* Vasculitis/ glomerulonephritis/ tubulointerstitial nephritis/ myeloma
* AKI with no known cause
* Inadequate response to treatment
* Complications of AKI
* Stage 3 AKI (see guideline for details)
* CKD stage 4 or 5
* Qualify for renal replacement hyperkalaemia / metabolic acidosis/ complications of uraemia/ fluid overload (pulmonary oedema)
