Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inherited cause of kidney disease, affecting 1 in 1,000 Caucasians. Two disease loci have been identified, PKD1 and PKD2, which code for polycystin\-1 and polycystin\-2 respectively  
  


| **ADPKD type 1** | **ADPKD type 2** |
| --- | --- |
| 85% of cases | 15% of cases |
| Chromosome 16 | Chromosome 4 |
| Presents with renal failure earlier |  |

  
The screening investigation for relatives is abdominal ultrasound:  
  
Ultrasound diagnostic criteria (in patients with positive family history)  
* two cysts, unilateral or bilateral, if aged \< 30 years
* two cysts in both kidneys if aged 30\-59 years
* four cysts in both kidneys if aged \> 60 years

  
Management
----------

  
For select patients, tolvaptan (vasopressin receptor 2 antagonist) may be an option. NICE recommended it as an option for treating ADPKD in adults to slow the progression of cyst development and renal insufficiency only if:  
* they have chronic kidney disease stage 2 or 3 at the start of treatment
* there is evidence of rapidly progressing disease and
* the company provides it with the discount agreed in the patient access scheme.
