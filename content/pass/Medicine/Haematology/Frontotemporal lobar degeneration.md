Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the third most common type of cortical dementia after Alzheimer's and Lewy body dementia.   
  
There are three recognised types of FTLD  
* Frontotemporal dementia (Pick's disease)
* Progressive non fluent aphasia (chronic progressive aphasia, CPA)
* Semantic dementia

  


| **Common features of frontotemporal lobar dementias** |
| --- |
| Onset before 65 |
| Insidious onset |
| Relatively preserved memory and visuospatial skills |
| Personality change and social conduct problems |

  
Pick's disease
--------------

  
This is the most common type and is characterised by personality change and impaired social conduct. Other common features include hyperorality, disinhibition, increased appetite, and perseveration behaviours.  
  
Focal gyral atrophy with a knife\-blade appearance is characteristic of Pick's disease.  
  
Macroscopic changes seen in Pick's disease include:\-  
* Atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes

  
Microscopic changes include:\-  
* Pick bodies \- spherical aggregations of tau protein (silver\-staining)
* Gliosis
* Neurofibrillary tangles
* Senile plaques

  
Management  
* NICE do not recommend that AChE inhibitors or memantine are used in people with frontotemporal dementia

  
CPA
---

  
Here the chief factor is non fluent speech. They make short utterances that are agrammatic. Comprehension is relatively preserved.  
  
Semantic dementia
-----------------

  
Here the patient has a fluent progressive aphasia. The speech is fluent but empty and conveys little meaning. Unlike in Alzheimer's memory is better for recent rather than remote events.
