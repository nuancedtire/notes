Acute confusional state is also known as delirium or acute organic brain syndrome. It affects up to 30% of elderly patients admitted to hospital.  
  
Predisposing factors include:  
* age \> 65 years
* background of dementia
* significant injury e.g. hip fracture
* frailty or multimorbidity
* polypharmacy

  
The precipitating events are often multifactorial and may include:  
* infection: particularly urinary tract infections
* metabolic: e.g. hypercalcaemia, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, dehydration
* change of environment
* any significant cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological or endocrine condition
* severe pain
* alcohol withdrawal
* constipation

  
Features \- a wide variety of presentations  
* memory disturbances (loss of short term \> long term)
* may be very agitated or withdrawn
* disorientation
* mood change
* visual hallucinations
* disturbed sleep cycle
* poor attention

  
Management  
* treatment of the underlying cause
* modification of the environment
* the 2006 Royal College of Physicians publication 'The prevention, diagnosis and management of delirium in older people: concise guidelines' recommended haloperidol 0\.5 mg as the first\-line sedative
* the 2010 NICE delirium guidelines advocate the use of haloperidol or olanzapine
* management can be challenging in patients with Parkinson's disease, as antipsychotics can often worsen Parkinsonian symptoms
	+ careful reduction of the Parkinson medication may be helpful
	+ if symptoms require urgent treatment then the atypical antipsychotics quetiapine and clozapine are preferred
