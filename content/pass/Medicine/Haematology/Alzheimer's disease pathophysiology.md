Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain accounting for the majority of dementia seen in the UK.  
  
Risk factors  
* increasing age
* family history of Alzheimer's disease
* 5% of cases are inherited as an autosomal dominant trait
	+ mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (chromosome 21\), presenilin 1 (chromosome 14\) and presenilin 2 (chromosome 1\) genes are thought to cause the inherited form
* apoprotein E allele E4 \- encodes a cholesterol transport protein
* Caucasian ethnicity
* Down's syndrome

  
Pathological changes  
* macroscopic:
	+ widespread cerebral atrophy, particularly involving the cortex and hippocampus
* microscopic:
	+ cortical plaques due to deposition of type A\-Beta\-amyloid protein and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles caused by abnormal aggregation of the tau protein
	+ hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein has been linked to AD
* biochemical
	+ there is a deficit of acetylcholine from damage to an ascending forebrain projection

  
Neurofibrillary tangles  
* paired helical filaments are partly made from a protein called tau
* tau is a protein that interacts with tubulin to stabilize microtubules and promote tubulin assembly into microtubules
* in AD are tau proteins are excessively phosphorylated, impairing its function
