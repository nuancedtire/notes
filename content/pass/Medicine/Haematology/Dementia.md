Dementia is thought to affect over 700,000 people in the UK and accounts for a large amount of health and social care spending. The most common cause of dementia in the UK is Alzheimer's disease followed by vascular and Lewy body dementia. These conditions may coexist.  
  
Features  
* diagnosis can be difficult and is often delayed
* assessment tools recommended by NICE for the non\-specialist setting include: 10\-point cognitive screener (10\-CS), 6\-Item cognitive impairment test (6CIT)
* assessment tools **not** recommended by NICE for the non\-specialist setting include the abbreviated mental test score (AMTS), General practitioner assessment of cognition (GPCOG) and the mini\-mental state examination (MMSE) have been widely used. A MMSE score of 24 or less out of 30 suggests dementia

  
Management  
* in primary care, a blood screen is usually sent to exclude reversible causes (e.g. Hypothyroidism). NICE recommend the following tests: FBC, U\&E, LFTs, calcium, glucose, ESR/CRP, TFTs, vitamin B12 and folate levels. Patients are now commonly referred on to old\-age psychiatrists (sometimes working in 'memory clinics').
* in secondary care, neuroimaging is performed\* to exclude other reversible conditions (e.g. Subdural haematoma, normal pressure hydrocephalus) and help provide information on aetiology to guide prognosis and management

  
\*in the 2011 NICE guidelines structural imaging was said to be essential in the investigation of dementia
