Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are currently used for the following indications:  
* prevention of stroke in non\-valvular AF. NICE stipulate that certain other risk factors should be present. These are complicated and differ between the DOACs but generally require one of the following to be present:
	+ prior stroke or transient ischaemic attack
	+ age 75 years or older
	+ hypertension
	+ diabetes mellitus
	+ heart failure
* prevention of VTE following hip/knee surgery
* treatment of DVT and PE

  
The table below summaries some of the differences between the DOACs:
