Neutropaenia refers to a low neutrophil counts, \< 1\.5 \* 109. A normal neutophil count is 2\.0 \- 7\.5 \* 109.  
  
It is important to recognise as it predisposes to severe infection.  
  
Neutropaenia may be further subdivided as follows:  
  


| Severity | Neutrophil count |
| --- | --- |
| Mild | 1\.0 \- 1\.5 \* 109 |
| Moderate | 0\.5 \- 1\.0 \* 109 |
| Severe | \< 0\.5 \* 109 |
