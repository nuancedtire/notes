Overview  
* a myeloproliferative disorder
* thought to be caused by hyperplasia of abnormal megakaryocytes
* the resultant release of platelet derived growth factor is thought to stimulate fibroblasts
* haematopoiesis develops in the liver and spleen

  
Features  
* e.g. elderly person with symptoms of anaemia e.g. fatigue (the most common presenting symptom)
* massive splenomegaly
* hypermetabolic symptoms: weight loss, night sweats etc

  
Laboratory findings  
* anaemia
* high WBC and platelet count early in the disease
* 'tear\-drop' poikilocytes on blood film
* unobtainable bone marrow biopsy \- 'dry tap' therefore trephine biopsy needed
* high urate and LDH (reflect increased cell turnover)
