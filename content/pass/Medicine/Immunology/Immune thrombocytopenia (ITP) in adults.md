Immune (or idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an immune\-mediated reduction in the platelet count. Antibodies are directed against the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or Ib\-V\-IX complex.  
  
Children with ITP usually have an acute thrombocytopenia that may follow infection or vaccination. In contrast, adults tend to have a more chronic condition.  
  
ITP in adults
-------------

  
Epidemiology  
* more common in older females

  
Presentation  
* may be detected incidentally following routine bloods
* symptomatic patients may present with
	+ petechiae, purpura
	+ bleeding (e.g. epistaxis)
	+ catastrophic bleeding (e.g. intracranial) is not a common presentation

  
Investigations  
* full blood count: isolated thrombocytopenia
* blood film
* a bone marrow examination is no longer used routinely
* antiplatelet antibody testing has poor sensitivity and doesn't affect clinical management so is not commonly done

  
Management  
* first\-line treatment for ITP is oral prednisolone
* pooled normal human immunoglobulin (IVIG) may also be used
	+ it raises the platelet count quicker than steroids, therefore may be used if active bleeding or an urgent invasive procedure is required
* splenectomy is now less commonly used

  
Evan's syndrome  
* ITP in association with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA)
