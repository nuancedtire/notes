Thrombocytosis is an abnormally high platelet count, usually \> 400 \* 109/l.  
  
Causes of thrombocytosis  
* reactive: platelets are an acute phase reactant \- platelet count can increase in response to stress such as a severe infection, surgery. Iron deficiency anaemia can also cause a reactive thrombocytosis
* malignancy
* essential thrombocytosis (see below), or as part of another myeloproliferative disorder such as chronic myeloid leukaemia or polycythaemia rubra vera
* hyposplenism

  
Essential thrombocytosis
------------------------

  
Essential thrombocytosis is one of the myeloproliferative disorders which overlaps with chronic myeloid leukaemia, polycythaemia rubra vera and myelofibrosis. Megakaryocyte proliferation results in an overproduction of platelets.  
  
Features  
* platelet count \> 600 \* 109/l
* both thrombosis (venous or arterial) and haemorrhage can be seen
* a characteristic symptom is a burning sensation in the hands
* a JAK2 mutation is found in around 50% of patients

  
Management  
* hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) is widely used to reduce the platelet count
* interferon\-Î± is also used in younger patients
* low\-dose aspirin may be used to reduce the thrombotic risk
