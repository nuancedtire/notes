Blood product transfusion complications may be broadly classified into the following:  
* immunological: acute haemolytic, non\-haemolytic febrile, allergic/anaphylaxis
* infective
* transfusion\-related acute lung injury (TRALI)
* transfusion\-associated circulatory overload (TACO)
* other: hyperkalaemia, iron overload, clotting

  
The table below summaries some of the key features:  
  


| Reaction | Features | Management |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Non\-haemolytic febrile reaction**Thought to be caused by antibodies reacting with white cell fragments in the blood product and cytokines that have leaked from the blood cell during storage | Fever, chillsRed cell transfusion (1\-2%)Platelet transfusion (10\-30%) | Slow or stop the transfusionParacetamolMonitor |
| **Minor allergic reaction**Thought to be caused by foreign plasma proteins | Pruritus, urticaria | Temporarily stop the transfusionAntihistamineMonitor |
| **Anaphylaxis**Can be caused by patients with IgA deficiency who have anti\-IgA antibodies | Hypotension, dyspnoea, wheezing, angioedema. | Stop the transfusionIM adrenalineABC support* oxygen * fluids |
| **Acute haemolytic reaction** ABO\-incompatible blood e.g. secondary to human error | Fever, abdominal pain, hypotension | Stop transfusionConfirm diagnosis* check the identity of patient/name on blood product * send blood for direct Coombs test, repeat typing and cross\-matching  Supportive care* fluid resuscitation |
| **Transfusion\-associated circulatory overload (TACO)** Excessive rate of transfusion, pre\-existing heart failure | Pulmonary oedema, hypertension | Slow or stop transfusionConsider intravenous loop diuretic (e.g. furosemide) and oxygen |
| **Transfusion\-related acute lung injury (TRALI)** Non\-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema thought to be secondary to increased vascular permeability caused by host neutrophils that become activated by substances in donated blood | Hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates on chest x\-ray, fever, hypotension | Stop the transfusionOxygen and supportive care |

Acute haemolytic transfusion reaction
-------------------------------------

  
Acute haemolytic transfusion reaction results from a mismatch of blood group (ABO) which causes massive intravascular haemolysis. This is usually the result of red blood cell destruction by IgM\-type antibodies.  
  
Symptoms begin minutes after the transfusion is started and include a fever, abdominal and chest pain, agitation and hypotension.  
   
Treatment should include immediate transfusion termination, generous fluid resuscitation with saline solution and informing the lab  
  
Complications include disseminated intravascular coagulation, and renal failure  
  
  
Non\-haemolytic febrile reaction
--------------------------------

  
Febrile reactions  
* due to white blood cell HLA antibodies
* often the result of sensitization by previous pregnancies or transfusions
* paracetamol may be given

  
  
Allergic/anaphylaxis reaction
-----------------------------

  
Allergic reactions to blood transfusions are caused by hypersensitivity reactions to components within the transfusion. Symptoms typically arise within minutes of starting the transfusion and severity can range from urticaria to anaphylaxis with hypotension, dyspnoea, wheezing, and stridor, or angioedema.   
  
Simple urticaria should be treated by discontinuing the transfusion and with an antihistamine. Once the symptoms resolve, the transfusion may be continued with no need for further workup.   
  
More severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis should be treated urgently. The transfusion should be permanently discontinued, intramuscular adrenaline should be administered and supportive care. Antihistamine, corticosteroids and bronchodilators should also be considered for these patients.   
  
  
Transfusion\-related acute lung injury (TRALI)
----------------------------------------------

  
A rare but potentially fatal complication of blood transfusion. Characterised by the development of hypoxaemia / acute respiratory distress syndrome within 6 hours of transfusion. Features include:  
* hypoxia
* pulmonary infiltrates on chest x\-ray
* fever
* hypotension

  
  
Transfusion\-associated circulatory overload (TACO)
---------------------------------------------------

  
A relatively common reaction due to fluid overload resulting in pulmonary oedema. As well as features of pulmonary oedema the patient may also by hypertensive, a key difference from patients with TRALI.  
  
  
Infective
---------

  
### Bacterial and viral

  
The risk of infectious complications varies with different types of blood products due to their storage conditions, components involved, and duration of storage.  
  
Red Blood Cells (RBCs)  
* Pathogens: RBCs are primarily at risk for transmitting viral agents such as HIV, HBV, and HCV. Bacterial contamination is less common but possible, particularly from skin flora during collection.
* Clinical impact: Viral infections can lead to chronic disease states such as chronic hepatitis or AIDS. Bacterial infections may manifest as sepsis if not promptly treated.

  
Platelets  
* Pathogens: Platelets are stored at room temperature, which increases the risk of bacterial proliferation. Common contaminants include *Staphylococcus epidermidis* and *Bacillus cereus*.
* Clinical impact: Bacterial contamination of platelets is more likely to lead to rapid onset of sepsis and septic shock, given the optimal growth conditions during storage.

  
### Prions

  
Transmission of vCJD  
* although the absolute risk is very small, vCJD may be transmitted via blood transfusion
* a number of steps have been taken to minimise this risk, including:
	+ from late 1999 onward, all donations have undergone removal of white cells (leucodepletion) in order to reduce any vCJD infectivity present
	+ from 1999, plasma derivatives have been fractionated from imported plasma rather than being sourced from UK donors. Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) used for children and certain groups of adults needing frequent transfusions is also imported
	+ from 2004 onward, recipients of blood components have been excluded from donating blood
