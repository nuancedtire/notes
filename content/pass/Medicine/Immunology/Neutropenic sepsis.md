Neutropenic sepsis is a relatively common complication of cancer therapy, usually as a consequence of chemotherapy. It most commonly occurs 7\-14 days after chemotherapy. It may be defined as a neutrophil count of \< 0\.5 \* 109 in a patient who is having anticancer treatment and has one of the following:  
* a temperature higher than 38ÂºC or
* other signs or symptoms consistent with clinically significant sepsis

  
Aetiology  
* coagulase\-negative, Gram\-positive bacteria are the most common cause, particularly *Staphylococcus epidermidis*
	+ this is probably due to the use of indwelling lines in patients with cancer

  
Prophylaxis  
* if it is anticipated that patients are likely to have a neutrophil count of \< 0\.5 \* 109 as a consequence of their treatment they should be offered a fluoroquinolone

  
Management  
* antibiotics must be started immediately, do not wait for the WBC
* NICE recommends starting empirical antibiotic therapy with piperacillin with tazobactam (Tazocin) immediately
* many units add vancomycin if the patient has central venous access but NICE do not support this approach
* following this initial treatment patients are usually assessed by a specialist and risk\-stratified to see if they may be able to have outpatient treatment
* if patients are still febrile and unwell after 48 hours an alternative antibiotic such as meropenem is often prescribed \+/\- vancomycin
* if patients are not responding after 4\-6 days the Christie guidelines suggest ordering investigations for fungal infections (e.g. HRCT), rather than just starting therapy antifungal therapy blindly
* there may be a role for G\-CSF in selected patients
