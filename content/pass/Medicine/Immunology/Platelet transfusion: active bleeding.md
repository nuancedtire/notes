**Active bleeding**  
  
Offer platelet transfusions to patients with a platelet count of \<30 x 10 9 with clinically significant bleeding (World Health organisation bleeding grade 2\- e.g. haematemesis, melaena, prolonged epistaxis)  
  
Platelet thresholds for transfusion are higher (maximum \< 100 x 10 9) for patients with severe bleeding (World Health organisation bleeding grades 3\&4\), or bleeding at critical sites, such as the CNS.  
  
It should be noted that platelet transfusions have the highest risk of bacterial contamination compared to other types of blood product.  
  
Pre\-invasive procedure (prophylactic)
--------------------------------------

  
Platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia before surgery/ an invasive procedure. Aim for plt levels of:  
* \> 50Ã—109/L for most patients
* 50\-75Ã—109/L if high risk of bleeding
* \>100Ã—109/L if surgery at critical site

  
If no active bleeding or planned invasive procedure
---------------------------------------------------

  
A threshold of 10 x 109 except where platelet transfusion is contradindicated or there are alternative treatments for their condition  
  
For example, do not perform platelet transfusion for any of the following conditions:  
* Chronic bone marrow failure
* Autoimmune thrombocytopenia
* Heparin\-induced thrombocytopenia, or
* Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
