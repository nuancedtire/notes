Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with low plasma levels of the C1 inhibitor (C1\-INH, C1 esterase inhibitor) protein. C1\-INH is a multifunctional serine protease inhibitor \- the probable mechanism behind attacks is uncontrolled release of bradykinin resulting in oedema of tissues.  
  
Investigation  
* C1\-INH level is low during an attack
* low C2 and C4 levels are seen, even between attacks. Serum C4 is the most reliable and widely used screening tool

  
Symptoms  
* attacks may be proceeded by painful macular rash
* painless, non\-pruritic swelling of subcutaneous/submucosal tissues
* may affect upper airways, skin or abdominal organs (can occasionally present as abdominal pain due to visceral oedema)
* urticaria is not usually a feature

  
Management  
* acute
	+ HAE does not respond to adrenaline, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids
	+ IV C1\-inhibitor concentrate, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) if this is not available
* prophylaxis: anabolic steroid Danazol may help
