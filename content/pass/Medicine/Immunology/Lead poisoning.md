Along with acute intermittent porphyria, lead poisoning should be considered in questions giving a combination of abdominal pain and neurological signs. Lead poisoning results in defective ferrochelatase and ALA dehydratase function.  
  
Features  
* abdominal pain
* peripheral neuropathy (mainly motor)
* neuropsychiatric features
* fatigue
* constipation
* blue lines on gum margin (only 20% of adult patients, very rare in children)

  
Investigations  
* the blood lead level is usually used for diagnosis. Levels greater than 10 mcg/dl are considered significant
* full blood count: microcytic anaemia. Blood film shows red cell abnormalities including basophilic stippling and clover\-leaf morphology
* raised serum and urine levels of delta aminolaevulinic acid may be seen making it sometimes difficult to differentiate from acute intermittent porphyria
* urinary coproporphyrin is also increased (urinary porphobilinogen and uroporphyrin levels are normal to slightly increased)
* in children, lead can accumulate in the metaphysis of the bones although x\-rays are not part of the standard work\-up

  
Management \- various chelating agents are currently used:  
* dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)
* D\-penicillamine
* EDTA
* dimercaprol
