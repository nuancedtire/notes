Polycythaemia vera is a myeloproliferative disorder caused by clonal proliferation of a marrow stem cell leading to an increase in red cell volume, often accompanied by overproduction of neutrophils and platelets. It has a peak incidence in the sixth decade, with typical features including hyperviscosity, pruritus and splenomegaly.  
  
Management  
* aspirin
	+ reduces the risk of thrombotic events
* venesection
	+ first\-line treatment to keep the haemoglobin in the normal range
* chemotherapy
	+ hydroxyurea \- slight increased risk of secondary leukaemia
	+ phosphorus\-32 therapy

  
Prognosis  
* thrombotic events are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality
* 5\-15% of patients progress to myelofibrosis
* 5\-15% of patients progress to acute leukaemia (risk increased with chemotherapy treatment)
