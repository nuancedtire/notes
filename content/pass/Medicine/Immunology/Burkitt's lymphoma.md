Burkitt's lymphoma is a high\-grade B\-cell neoplasm. There are two major forms:  
* endemic (African) form: typically involves maxilla or mandible
* sporadic form: abdominal (e.g. ileo\-caecal) tumours are the most common form. More common in patients with HIV

  
Burkitt's lymphoma is associated with the c\-myc gene translocation, usually t(8:14\). The Epstein\-Barr virus (EBV) is strongly implicated in the development of the African form of Burkitt's lymphoma and to a lesser extent the sporadic form.  
  
Microscopy findings  
* 'starry sky' appearance: lymphocyte sheets interspersed with macrophages containing dead apoptotic tumour cells

  
Management is with chemotherapy. This tends to produce a rapid response which may cause 'tumour lysis syndrome'. Rasburicase (a recombinant version of urate oxidase, an enzyme which catalyses the conversion of uric acid to allantoin\*) is often given before the chemotherapy to reduce the risk of this occurring. Complications of tumour lysis syndrome include:  
* hyperkalaemia
* hyperphosphataemia
* hypocalcaemia
* hyperuricaemia
* acute renal failure

  
\*allantoin is 5\-10 times more soluble than uric acid, so renal excretion is more effective
