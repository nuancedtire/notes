Whole blood fractions
---------------------

  


| **Fraction** | **Key points** |
| --- | --- |
| Packed red cells | Used for transfusion in chronic anaemia and cases where infusion of large volumes of fluid may result in cardiovascular compromise. Product obtained by centrifugation of whole blood. |
| Platelet rich plasma | Usually administered to patients who are thrombocytopaenic and are bleeding or require surgery. It is obtained by low speed centrifugation. |
| Platelet concentrate | Prepared by high speed centrifugation and administered to patients with thrombocytopaenia. |
| Fresh frozen plasma | * Prepared from single units of blood. * Contains clotting factors, albumin and immunoglobulin. * Unit is usually 200 to 250ml. * Usually used in correcting clotting deficiencies in patients with hepatic synthetic failure who are due to undergo surgery. * Usual dose is 12\-15ml/Kg\-1. * It should not be used as first line therapy for hypovolaemia. |
| Cryoprecipitate | * Formed from supernatant of FFP. * Rich source of Factor VIII and fibrinogen. * Allows large concentration of factor VIII to be administered in small volume. |
| SAG\-Mannitol Blood | Removal of all plasma from a blood unit and substitution with:* Sodium chloride * Adenine * Anhydrous glucose * Mannitol  Up to 4 units of SAG M Blood may be administered. Thereafter whole blood is preferred. After 8 units, clotting factors and platelets should be considered. |

Cell saver devices
------------------

  
These collect patients own blood lost during surgery and then re\-infuse it. There are two main types:  
* Those which wash the blood cells prior to re\-infusion. These are more expensive to purchase and more complicated to operate. However, they reduce the risk of re\-infusing contaminated blood back into the patient.
* Those which do not wash the blood prior to re\-infusion.

Their main advantage is that they avoid the use of infusion of blood from donors into patients and this may reduce risk of blood borne infection. It may be acceptable to Jehovah's witnesses. It is contraindicated in malignant disease for risk of facilitating disease dissemination.  
  
Blood products used in warfarin reversal
----------------------------------------

  
In some surgical patients the use of warfarin can pose specific problems and may require the use of specialised blood products  
  
Immediate or urgent surgery in patients taking warfarin(1\) (2\):  
  
1\. Stop warfarin  
  
2\. Vitamin K (reversal within 4\-24 hours)  
* IV takes 4\-6h to work (at least 5mg)
* Oral can take 24 hours to be clinically effective

  
3\. Fresh frozen plasma  
* *Used less commonly now as 1st line warfarin reversal*
* 30ml/kg\-1
* Need to give at least 1L fluid in 70kg person (therefore not appropriate in fluid overload)
* Need blood group
* Only use if human prothrombin complex is not available

  
4\. Human Prothrombin Complex (reversal within 1 hour)  
* Bereplex 50 u/kg
* Rapid action but factor 6 short half life, therefore give with vitamin K
