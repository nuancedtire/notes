Multiple myeloma (MM) is a haematological malignancy characterised by plasma cell proliferation. It arises due to genetic mutations which occur as B\-lymphocytes differentiate into mature plasma cells.  
  
Features
--------

  
The median age at presentation is 70 years old.   
  
Use the mnemonic **CRABBI**:  
* Calcium
	+ hypercalcaemia
	+ primary factor: due primarily to increased osteoclastic bone resorption caused by local cytokines (e.g. IL\-1, tumour necrosis factor) released by the myeloma cells
	+ much less common contributing factors: impaired renal function, increased renal tubular calcium reabsorption and elevated PTH\-rP levels
	+ this leads to constipation, nausea, anorexia and confusion
* Renal
	+ monoclonal production of immunoglobulins results in light chain deposition within the renal tubules
	+ this causes renal damage which presents as dehydration and increasing thirst
	+ other causes of renal impairment in myeloma include amyloidosis, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis
* Anaemia
	+ bone marrow crowding suppresses erythropoiesis leading to anaemia
	+ this causes fatigue and pallor
* Bleeding
	+ bone marrow crowding also results in thrombocytopenia which puts patients at increased risk of bleeding and bruising
* Bones
	+ bone marrow infiltration by plasma cells and cytokine\-mediated osteoclast overactivity creates lytic bone lesions
	+ this may present as pain (especially in the back) and increases the risk of pathological fractures
* Infection
	+ a reduction in the production of normal immunoglobulins results in increased susceptibility to infection

  
Other features include  
* amyloidosis e.g. macroglossia
* carpal tunnel syndrome
* neuropathy
* hyperviscosity

  
  
Investigations
--------------

  
Bloods  
* full blood count: anaemia
* peripheral blood film: rouleaux formation
* urea and electrolytes: renal failure
* bone profile: hypercalcaemia

  
Protein electrophoresis  
* raised concentrations of monoclonal IgA/IgG proteins will be present in the serum
* in the urine, they are known as Bence Jones proteins

  
Bone marrow aspiration  
* confirms the diagnosis if the number of plasma cells is significantly raised

  
Imaging  
* historically a skeletal survey has been done to look for bone lesions
* however, whole\-body MRI is increasingly used and is now recommended in the 2016 NICE guidelines
* X\-rays: 'rain\-drop skull' (likened to the pattern rain forms after hitting a surface and splashing, where it leaves a random pattern of dark spots). Note that a very similar, but subtly different finding is found in primary hyperparathyroidism \- 'pepperpot skull'

  
  
Diagnostic criteria
-------------------

  
The diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma requires one major and one minor criteria or three minor criteria in an individual who has signs or symptoms of multiple myeloma.  
  
Major criteria  
* Plasmacytoma (as demonstrated on evaluation of biopsy specimen)
* 30% plasma cells in a bone marrow sample
* Elevated levels of M protein in the blood or urine

  
Minor criteria  
* 10% to 30% plasma cells in a bone marrow sample.
* Minor elevations in the level of M protein in the blood or urine.
* Osteolytic lesions (as demonstrated on imaging studies).
* Low levels of antibodies (not produced by the cancer cells) in the blood.
