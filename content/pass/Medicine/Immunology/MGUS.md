Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS, also known as benign paraproteinaemia and monoclonal gammopathy) is a common condition that causes a paraproteinaemia and is often mistaken for myeloma. Differentiating features are listed below. Around 10% of patients eventually develop myeloma at 10 years, with 50% at 15 years  
  
Features  
* usually asymptomatic
* no bone pain or increased risk of infections
* around 10\-30% of patients have a demyelinating neuropathy

  
Differentiating features from myeloma  
* normal immune function
* normal beta\-2 microglobulin levels
* lower level of paraproteinaemia than myeloma (e.g. \< 30g/l IgG, or \< 20g/l IgA)
* stable level of paraproteinaemia
* no clinical features of myeloma (e.g. lytic lesions on x\-rays or renal disease)
