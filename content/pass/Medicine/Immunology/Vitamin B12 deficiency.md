Vitamin B12 is mainly used in the body for red blood cell development and also maintenance of the nervous system. It is absorbed after binding to intrinsic factor (secreted from parietal cells in the stomach) and is actively absorbed in the terminal ileum. A small amount of vitamin B12 is passively absorbed without being bound to intrinsic factor.  
  
Causes of vitamin B12 deficiency  
* pernicious anaemia: most common cause
* post gastrectomy
* vegan diet or a poor diet
* disorders/surgery of terminal ileum (site of absorption)
	+ Crohn's: either diease activity or following ileocaecal resection
* metformin (rare)

  
Features of vitamin B12 deficiency  
* macrocytic anaemia
* sore tongue and mouth
* neurological symptoms
	+ the dorsal column is usually affected first (joint position, vibration) prior to distal paraesthesia
* neuropsychiatric symptoms: e.g. mood disturbances

  
Management  
* if no neurological involvement 1 mg of IM hydroxocobalamin 3 times each week for 2 weeks, then once every 3 months
* if a patient is also deficient in folic acid then it is important to treat the B12 deficiency first to avoid precipitating subacute combined degeneration of the cord
