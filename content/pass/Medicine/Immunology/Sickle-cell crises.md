Sickle cell anaemia is characterised by periods of good health with intervening crises  
  
A number of types of crises are recognised:  
* thrombotic, 'vaso\-occlusive', 'painful crises'
* acute chest syndrome
* anaemic
	+ aplastic
	+ sequestration
* infection

  
Thrombotic crises  
* also known as painful crises or vaso\-occlusive crises
* precipitated by infection, dehydration, deoxygenation (e.g. high altitude)
* painful vaso\-occlusive crises should be diagnosed clinically \- there isn't one test that can confirm them although tests may be done to exclude other complications
* infarcts occur in various organs including the bones (e.g. avascular necrosis of hip, hand\-foot syndrome in children, lungs, spleen and brain

  
Acute chest syndrome  
* vaso\-occlusion within the pulmonary microvasculature â†’ infarction in the lung parenchyma
* dyspnoea, chest pain, pulmonary infiltrates on chest x\-ray, low pO2
* management
	+ pain relief
	+ respiratory support e.g. oxygen therapy
	+ antibiotics: infection may precipitate acute chest syndrome and the clinical findings (respiratory symptoms with pulmonary infiltrates) can be difficult to distinguish from pneumonia
	+ transfusion: improves oxygenation
* the most common cause of death after childhood

  
Aplastic crises  
* caused by infection with parvovirus
* sudden fall in haemoglobin
* bone marrow suppression causes a reduced reticulocyte count

  
Sequestration crises  
* sickling within organs such as the spleen or lungs causes pooling of blood with worsening of the anaemia
* associated with an increased reticulocyte count
