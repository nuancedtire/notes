Complications  
* anaemia
* hypogammaglobulinaemia leading to recurrent infections
* warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia in 10\-15% of patients
* transformation to high\-grade lymphoma (Richter's transformation)

  
Richter's transformation
------------------------

  
Ritcher's transformation occurs when leukaemia cells enter the lymph node and change into a high\-grade, fast\-growing non\-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients often become unwell very suddenly.   
  
Ritcher's transformation is indicated by one of the following symptoms:   
* lymph node swelling
* fever without infection
* weight loss
* night sweats
* nausea
* abdominal pain
