Paraproteinaemia is a haematological condition characterized by the abnormal overproduction of a single type of immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin fragment, referred to as a paraprotein or M\-protein. The increased production of paraprotein is commonly associated with monoclonal gammopathies, a group of disorders arising from the clonal expansion of plasma cells or B\-lymphocytes.  
  
Paraproteinaemia can be classified into benign and malignant forms based on the underlying cause.  
  
Benign paraproteinaemia:  
* Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
* Transient paraproteinaemia (e.g., following an infection)

  
Malignant paraproteinaemia:  
* Multiple myeloma
* Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia
* Primary amyloidosis (AL)
* B\-cell lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, non\-Hodgkin lymphoma)

  
Clinical features  
* Hyperviscosity syndrome
* Neuropathy (e.g., sensory, motor, or autonomic dysfunction)
* Renal dysfunction
* Hematologic abnormalities (e.g anaemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia)
* Bone pain or pathologic fractures (in the context of multiple myeloma)
