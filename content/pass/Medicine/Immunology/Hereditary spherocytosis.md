Basics  
* most common hereditary haemolytic anaemia in people of northern European descent
* autosomal dominant defect of red blood cell cytoskeleton
* the normal biconcave disc shape is replaced by a sphere\-shaped red blood cell
* red blood cell survival reduced as destroyed by the spleen

  
Presentation  
* failure to thrive
* jaundice, gallstones
* splenomegaly
* aplastic crisis precipitated by parvovirus infection
* degree of haemolysis variable
* MCHC elevated

  
Diagnosis  
* the osmotic fragility test was previously the recommend investigation of choice. However, it is now deemed unreliable and is no longer recommended
* the British Journal of Haematology (BJH) guidelines state that '*patients with a family history of HS, typical clinical features and laboratory investigations (spherocytes, raised mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration \[MCHC], increase in reticulocytes) do not require any additional tests*
* if the diagnosis is equivocal the BJH recommend the EMA binding test and the cryohaemolysis test
* for atypical presentations electrophoresis analysis of erythrocyte membranes is the method of choice

  
Management  
* acute haemolytic crisis:
	+ treatment is generally supportive
	+ transfusion if necessary
* longer term treatment:
	+ folate replacement
	+ splenectomy

Comparison of G6PD deficiency to hereditary spherocytosis  


|  | **G6PD deficiency** | **Hereditary spherocytosis** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gender** | Male (X\-linked recessive) | Male \+ female (autosomal dominant) |
| **Ethnicity** | African \+ Mediterranean descent | Northern European descent |
| **Typical history** | • Neonatal jaundice • Infection/drugs precipitate haemolysis • Gallstones | • Neonatal jaundice • Chronic symptoms although haemolytic crises may be precipitated by infection • Gallstones • Splenomegaly is common |
| **Blood film** | Heinz bodies | Spherocytes (round, lack of central pallor) |
| **Diagnostic test** | Measure enzyme activity of G6PD | EMA binding test |
