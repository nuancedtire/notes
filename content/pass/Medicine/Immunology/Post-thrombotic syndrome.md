It is increasingly recognised that patients may develop complications following a DVT. Venous outflow obstruction and venous insufficiency result in chronic venous hypertension. The resulting clinical syndrome is known as post\-thrombotic syndrome. The following features maybe seen:  
* painful, heavy calves
* pruritus
* swelling
* varicose veins
* venous ulceration

  
Compression stockings have in the past been offered to patients with deep vein thrombosis to help reduce the risk of post\-thrombotic syndrome.  
  
However, Clinical Knowledge Summaries now state the following:  
  
 **Do not offer elastic graduated compression stockings to prevent post\-thrombotic syndrome or VTE recurrence after a proximal DVT. This recommendation does not cover the use of elastic stockings for the management of leg symptoms after DVT.**  
However, once post\-thrombotic syndrome has developed compression stockings are a recommended treatment. Other recommendations including keeping the leg elevated.
