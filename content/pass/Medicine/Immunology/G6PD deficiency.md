Glucose\-6\-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the commonest red blood cell enzyme defect. It is more common in people from the Mediterranean and Africa and is inherited in an X\-linked recessive fashion. Many drugs can precipitate a crisis as well as infections and broad (fava) beans  
  
Pathophysiology  
* G6PD is the first step in the pentose phosphate pathway, which converts glucose\-6\-phosphate→ 6\-phosphogluconolactone
	+ this reaction also results in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) → NADPH
	+ i.e. glucose\-6\-phosphate \+ NADP → 6\-phosphogluconolactone \+ NADPH
* NADPH is important for converting oxidizied glutathine back to it's reduced form
* reduced glutathine protects red blood cells from oxidative damage by oxidants such as superoxide anion (O2\-) and hydrogen peroxide
* ↓ G6PD → ↓ reduced NADPH → ↓ reduced glutathione → increased red cell susceptibility to oxidative stress

  
Features  
* neonatal jaundice is often seen
* intravascular haemolysis
* gallstones are common
* splenomegaly may be present
* Heinz bodies on blood films. Bite and blister cells may also be seen

  
Diagnosis is made by using a G6PD enzyme assay  
* levels should be checked around 3 months after an acute episode of hemolysis, RBCs with the most severely reduced G6PD activity will have hemolysed → reduced G6PD activity → not be measured in the assay → false negative results

  
Some drugs causing haemolysis  
* anti\-malarials: primaquine
* ciprofloxacin
* sulph\- group drugs: sulphonamides, sulphasalazine, sulfonylureas

  
Some drugs thought to be safe  
* penicillins
* cephalosporins
* macrolides
* tetracyclines
* trimethoprim

Comparison of G6PD deficiency to hereditary spherocytosis  


|  | **G6PD deficiency** | **Hereditary spherocytosis** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Gender** | Male (X\-linked recessive) | Male \+ female (autosomal dominant) |
| **Ethnicity** | African \+ Mediterranean descent | Northern European descent |
| **Typical history** | • Neonatal jaundice • Infection/drugs precipitate haemolysis • Gallstones | • Neonatal jaundice • Chronic symptoms although haemolytic crises may be precipitated by infection • Gallstones • Splenomegaly is common |
| **Blood film** | Heinz bodies | Spherocytes (round, lack of central pallor) |
| **Diagnostic test** | Measure enzyme activity of G6PD | EMA binding |
