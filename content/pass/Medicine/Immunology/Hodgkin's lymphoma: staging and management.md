Hodgkin's lymphoma is a malignant proliferation of lymphocytes characterised by the presence of the Reed\-Sternberg cell. It has a bimodal age distribution being most common in the third and seventh decades.  
  
Staging
-------

  
### Ann\-Arbor staging

  
The Ann\-Arbor staging system was historically the main way patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma were staged.   
  
Stage  
* I: single lymph node
* II: 2 or more lymph nodes/regions on the same side of the diaphragm
* III: nodes on both sides of the diaphragm
* IV: spread beyond lymph nodes

  
Each stage may be subdivided into A or B  
* A \= no systemic symptoms other than pruritus
* B \= weight loss \> 10% in last 6 months, fever \> 38c, night sweats (poor prognosis)

  
### Lugano classification

  
The Lugano classification is a system used to stage Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as other types of lymphomas. It was developed to update and replace the older Ann Arbor staging system, with the aim of incorporating modern imaging techniques, particularly positron emission tomography (PET) scans, into the staging process.  
  
Stage  
* Stage I: Involvement of a single lymph node region (I) or a single extralymphatic organ or site (IE).
* Stage II: Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (II) or localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site and one or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (IIE).
* Stage III: Involvement of lymph node regions on both sides of the diaphragm (III), which may also be accompanied by localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site (IIIE), involvement of the spleen (IIIS), or both (IIIE\+S).
* Stage IV: Diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, with or without associated lymph node involvement.

  
In addition to these stages, the classification includes the following:  
* A/B Symptom Designation: The absence of significant symptoms is designated as 'A', while the presence of fever, night sweats, or weight loss is designated as 'B'.
* E: The presence of extranodal disease is denoted by the letter 'E'.
* S: Involvement of the spleen is denoted by the letter 'S'.
* X: Bulky disease (large tumor mass) is denoted by the letter 'X'.

  
The Lugano classification also emphasizes the role of PET scans in determining the stage of the disease, particularly in assessing whether the lymphoma is metabolically active in different parts of the body.   
  
Management
----------

  
Management  
* chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Two combinations may be used
	+ ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine): considered the standard regime
	+ BEACOPP (bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone): alternative regime with better remission rates but higher toxicity
* radiotherapy
* combined modality therapy (CMT)
	+ chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy
* hematopoietic cell transplantation
	+ may be used for relapsed or refractory classic Hodgkin lymphoma

  
Complications of treatment  
* most patients now achieve long\-term survival free of Hodgkin's lymphoma with modern therapy
* complications of treatment are therefore more of an issue for these patients
* secondary malignancies are a risk, in particular solid tumours: breast and lung
