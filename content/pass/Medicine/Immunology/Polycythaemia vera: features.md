Polycythaemia vera (previously called polycythaemia rubra vera) is a myeloproliferative disorder caused by clonal proliferation of a marrow stem cell leading to an increase in red cell volume, often accompanied by overproduction of neutrophils and platelets. It has recently been established that a mutation in JAK2 is present in approximately 95% of patients with polycythaemia vera and this has resulted in significant changes to the diagnostic criteria. The incidence of polycythaemia vera peaks in the sixth decade.  
  
Features  
* pruritus, typically after a hot bath
* splenomegaly
* hypertension
* hyperviscosity
	+ arterial thrombosis
	+ venous thrombosis
* haemorrhage (secondary to abnormal platelet function)
* low ESR

  
Following history and examination, the British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) recommend the following tests are performed  
* full blood count/film (raised haematocrit; neutrophils, basophils, platelets raised in half of patients)
* JAK2 mutation
* serum ferritin
* renal and liver function tests

  
If the JAK2 mutation is negative and there is no obvious secondary causes the BCSH suggest the following tests:  
* red cell mass
* arterial oxygen saturation
* abdominal ultrasound
* serum erythropoietin level
* bone marrow aspirate and trephine
* cytogenetic analysis
* erythroid burst\-forming unit (BFU\-E) culture

  
Other features that may be seen in PRV include a low ESR and a raised leukocyte alkaline phosphatase  
  
The diagnostic criteria for polycythaemia vera have recently been updated by the BCSH. This replaces the previous polycythaemia vera Study Group criteria.   
  
JAK2\-positive polycythaemia vera \- diagnosis requires both criteria to be present  
  


| **Criteria** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| A1 | High haematocrit (\>0\.52 in men, \>0\.48 in women) OR raised red cell mass (\>25% above predicted) |
| A2 | Mutation in JAK2 |

  
JAK2\-negative PRV \- diagnosis requires A1 \+ A2 \+ A3 \+ either another A or two B criteria  
  


| **Criteria** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| A1 | Raised red cell mass (\>25% above predicted) OR haematocrit \>0\.60 in men, \>0\.56 in women |
| A2 | Absence of mutation in JAK2 |
| A3 | No cause of secondary erythrocytosis |
| A4 | Palpable splenomegaly |
| A5 | Presence of an acquired genetic abnormality (excluding BCR\-ABL) in the haematopoietic cells |
| B1 | Thrombocytosis (platelet count \>450 \* 109/l) |
| B2 | Neutrophil leucocytosis (neutrophil count \> 10 \* 109/l in non\-smokers; \> 12\.5\*109/l in smokers) |
| B3 | Radiological evidence of splenomegaly |
| B4 | Endogenous erythroid colonies or low serum erythropoietin |
