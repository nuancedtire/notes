Causes  
* iron\-deficiency anaemia
* thalassaemia\*
* congenital sideroblastic anaemia
* anaemia of chronic disease (more commonly a normocytic, normochromic picture)
* lead poisoning

  
A question sometimes seen in exams gives a history of a normal haemoglobin level associated with a microcytosis. In patients not at risk of thalassaemia, this should raise the possibility of polycythaemia rubra vera which may cause an iron\-deficiency secondary to bleeding.  
  
New onset microcytic anaemia in elderly patients should be urgently investigated to exclude underlying malignancy.  
  
\*in beta\-thalassaemia minor the microcytosis is often disproportionate to the anaemia
