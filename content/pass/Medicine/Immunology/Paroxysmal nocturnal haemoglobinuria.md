Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired disorder leading to haemolysis (mainly intravascular) of haematological cells. It is thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of cell membranes to complement (see below) due to a lack of glycoprotein glycosyl\-phosphatidylinositol (GPI). Patients are more prone to venous thrombosis  
  
Pathophysiology  
* GPI can be thought of as an anchor which attaches surface proteins to the cell membrane
* complement\-regulating surface proteins, e.g. decay\-accelerating factor (DAF), are not properly bound to the cell membrane due a lack of GPI
* thrombosis is thought to be caused by a lack of CD59 on platelet membranes predisposing to platelet aggregation

  
Features  
* haemolytic anaemia
* red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets or stem cells may be affected therefore pancytopaenia may be present
* haemoglobinuria: classically dark\-coloured urine in the morning (although has been shown to occur throughout the day)
* thrombosis e.g. Budd\-Chiari syndrome
* aplastic anaemia may develop in some patients

  
Diagnosis  
* flow cytometry of blood to detect low levels of CD59 and CD55 has now replaced Ham's test as the gold standard investigation in PNH
* Ham's test: acid\-induced haemolysis (normal red cells would not)

  
Management  
* blood product replacement
* anticoagulation
* eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against terminal protein C5, is currently being trialled and is showing promise in reducing intravascular haemolysis
* stem cell transplantation
