The Philadelphia chromosome is present in more than 95% of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). It is due to a translocation between the long arm of chromosome 9 and 22 \- t(9:22\)(q34; q11\). This results in part of the ABL proto\-oncogene from chromosome 9 being fused with the BCR gene from chromosome 22\. The resulting BCR\-ABL gene codes for a fusion protein that has tyrosine kinase activity in excess of normal.  
  
Presentation (60\-70 years)  
* anaemia: lethargy
* weight loss and sweating are common
* splenomegaly may be marked â†’ abdo discomfort
* an increase in granulocytes at different stages of maturation \+/\- thrombocytosis
* decreased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase
* may undergo blast transformation (AML in 80%, ALL in 20%)

  
Management  
* imatinib is now considered first\-line treatment
	+ inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase associated with the BCR\-ABL defect
	+ very high response rate in chronic phase CML
* hydroxyurea
* interferon\-alpha
* allogenic bone marrow transplant
