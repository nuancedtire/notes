Inherited
---------

  
Gain of function polymorphisms  
* factor V Leiden (activated protein C resistance): most common cause of thrombophilia
* prothrombin gene mutation: second most common cause

  
Deficiencies of naturally occurring anticoagulants  
* antithrombin III deficiency
* protein C deficiency
* protein S deficiency

  
The table below shows the prevalence and relative risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) of the different inherited thrombophilias:  
  


| Condition | Prevalence | Relative risk of VTE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Factor V Leiden (heterozygous) | 5% | 4 |
| Factor V Leiden (homozygous) | 0\.05% | 10 |
| Prothrombin gene mutation (heterozygous) | 1\.5% | 3 |
| Protein C deficiency | 0\.3% | 10 |
| Protein S deficiency | 0\.1% | 5\-10 |
| Antithrombin III deficiency | 0\.02% | 10\-20 |

  
Acquired
--------

  
Antiphospholipid syndrome  
  
Drugs  
* the combined oral contraceptive pill
