Acute myeloid leukaemia is the more common form of acute leukaemia in adults. It may occur as a primary disease or following a secondary transformation of a myeloproliferative disorder.  
  
Features are largely related to bone marrow failure:  
* anaemia: pallor, lethargy, weakness
* neutropenia: whilst white cell counts may be very high, functioning neutrophil levels may be low leading to frequent infections etc
* thrombocytopenia: bleeding
* splenomegaly
* bone pain

  
Poor prognostic features  
* \> 60 years
* \> 20% blasts after first course of chemo
* cytogenetics: deletions of chromosome 5 or 7

  
Acute promyelocytic leukaemia M3  
* associated with t(15;17\)
* fusion of PML and RAR\-alpha genes
* presents younger than other types of AML (average \= 25 years old)
* Auer rods (seen with myeloperoxidase stain)
* DIC or thrombocytopenia often at presentation
* good prognosis

  
Classification \- French\-American\-British (FAB)
