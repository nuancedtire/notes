Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is caused by a monoclonal proliferation of well\-differentiated lymphocytes which are almost always B\-cells (99%). It is the most common form of leukaemia seen in adults.  
  
Features  
* often none: may be picked up by an incidental finding of lymphocytosis
* constitutional: anorexia, weight loss
* bleeding, infections
* lymphadenopathy more marked than chronic myeloid leukaemia

  
Investigations  
* full blood count:
	+ lymphocytosis
	+ anaemia: may occur either due to bone marrow replacement or autoimmune hemolytic anaemia (AIHA)
	+ thrombocytopenia: may occur either due to bone marrow replacement or immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)
* blood film: smudge cells (also known as smear cells)
* immunophenotyping is the key investigation
	+ most cases can be identified using a panel of antibodies specific for CD5, CD19, CD20 and CD23
