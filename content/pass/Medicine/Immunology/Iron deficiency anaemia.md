Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common anaemia worldwide. Iron is needed to make the haemoglobin in red blood cells, therefore a deficiency of iron leads to a reduction in red blood cells/haemoglobin i.e. anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemia has the highest incidence amongst preschool\-age children. The main causes are excessive blood loss, inadequate dietary intake, poor intestinal absorption and increased iron requirements.  
  
Epidemiology  
* Globally, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia
* Preschool\-age children have the highest prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia

  
Causes  
* Excessive blood loss: blood loss due to menorrhagia is the most common cause in pre\-menopausal women, whereas gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common cause in men (always suspect colon cancer) and post\-menopausal women.
* Inadequate dietary intake: as meat is a good source of iron, vegans and vegetarians are more likely to develop iron deficiency anaemia due to a lack of meat in their diet. However dark green leafy vegetables are another good source of iron, therefore people who don't eat meat can still receive enough iron through purely dietary sources.
* Poor intestinal absorption: conditions which affect the small intestine, such as coeliac disease, can prevent sufficient iron being absorbed.
* Increased iron requirements: children have increased iron demands during periods of rapid growth. Women also have increased demands during pregnancy as the baby will receive their iron supply from the mother. In addition, an increase in plasma volume during pregnancy causes iron deficiency anaemia through dilution i.e. the proportion of fluid in comparison to red blood cells increases.

  
Features  
* Fatigue
* Shortness of breath on exertion
* Palpitations
* Pallor
* Nail changes: this includes koilonychia (spoon\-shaped nails)
* Hair loss
* Atrophic glossitis
* Post\-cricoid webs
* Angular stomatitis

  
Investigations  
* Taking a history is the most important step in looking for potential causes of iron deficiency. It is useful to inquire about: changes in diet, medication history, menstrual history, weight loss, change in bowel habit
* Full blood count (FBC) *demonstrates hypochromic microcytic anaemia*
* Serum ferritin *this will likely be low, as serum ferritin correlates with iron stores. However, it is important to recognise that ferritin can be raised during states of inflammation; so a raised ferritin does not necessarily rule out iron deficiency anaemia if the is co\-occurring inflammation. For patients with co\-occurring inflammatory disease, other iron studies can be performed.*
* Total iron\-binding capacity (TIBC)/transferrin *this will be high*. A high TIBC reflects low iron stores. . Note that the transferrin *saturation* will however be low
* Blood film *anisopoikilocytosis (red blood cells of different sizes and shapes)* , target cells, 'pencil' poikilocytes
* Endoscopy  *to rule out malignancy, males and post\-menopausal females who present with unexplained iron\-deficiency anaemia should be considered for further gastrointestinal investigations. Post\-menopausal women with a haemoglobin level ≤10 and men with a haemoglobin level ≤11 should be referred to a gastroenterologist within 2 weeks.*

  
Management  
* The underlying cause of the iron\-deficiency anaemia must be identified and managed. It is particularly important that malignancy has been excluded by taking an adequate history and appropriate investigations if warranted
* Oral ferrous sulfate: patients should continue taking iron for 3 months after the iron deficiency has been corrected in order to replenish iron stores. Common side effects of iron supplementation include nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea
* Iron\-rich diet: this includes dark\-green leafy vegetables, meat, iron\-fortified bread
