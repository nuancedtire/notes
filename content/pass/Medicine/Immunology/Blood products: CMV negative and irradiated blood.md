Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is transmitted in leucocytes. As most blood products (except granulocyte transfusions) are now leucocyte depleted CMV negative products are rarely required.  
  
Irradiated blood products are depleted of T\-lymphocytes and used to avoid transfusion\-associated graft versus host disease (TA\-GVHD) caused by engraftment of viable donor T lymphocytes.  
  
The table below shows the indications for CMV and irradiated blood:  
  


| Situation | CMV negative | Irradiated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Granulocyte transfusions | ✓ | ✓ |
| Intra\-uterine transfusions | ✓ | ✓ |
| Neonates up to 28 days post expected date of delivery | ✓ | ✓ |
| Pregnancy: Elective transfusions during pregnancy (not during labour or delivery) | ✓ |  |
| Bone marrow / stem cell transplants |  | ✓ |
| Immunocompromised (e.g. chemotherapy or congenital) |  | ✓ |
| Patients with/previous Hodgkin lymphoma |  | ✓ |
| HIV |  |  |
