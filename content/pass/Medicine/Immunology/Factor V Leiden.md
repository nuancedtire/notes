Factor V Leiden (activated protein C resistance) is the most common inherited thrombophilia, being present in around 5% of the UK population.   
  
It is due to a gain of function mutation in the Factor V Leiden protein. The result of the mis\-sense mutation is that activated factor V (a clotting factor) is inactivated 10 times more slowly by activated protein C than normal. This explains the alternative name for factor V Leiden of activated protein C resistance,  
  
Heterozygotes have a 4\-5 fold risk of venous thrombosis. Homozygotes have a 10 fold risk of venous thrombosis but the prevalence is much lower at 0\.05%.  
  
Screening for factor V Leiden is not recommended, even after a venous thromboembolism. The logic behind this is that a previous thromboembolism itself is a risk factor for further events and this should dictate specific management in the future, rather than the particular thrombophilia identified.  
  
The table below shows the prevalence and relative risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) of the different inherited thrombophilias:  
  


| Condition | Prevalence | Relative risk of VTE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Factor V Leiden (heterozygous) | 5% | 4 |
| Factor V Leiden (homozygous) | 0\.05% | 10 |
| Prothrombin gene mutation (heterozygous) | 1\.5% | 3 |
| Protein C deficiency | 0\.3% | 10 |
| Protein S deficiency | 0\.1% | 5\-10 |
| Antithrombin III deficiency | 0\.02 | 10\-20 |
