Antiphospholipid syndrome is an acquired disorder characterised by a predisposition to both venous and arterial thromboses, recurrent fetal loss and thrombocytopenia. It may occur as a primary disorder or secondary to other conditions, most commonly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  
  
In pregnancy the following complications may occur:  
* recurrent miscarriage
* IUGR
* pre\-eclampsia
* placental abruption
* pre\-term delivery
* venous thromboembolism

  
Management  
* low\-dose aspirin should be commenced once the pregnancy is confirmed on urine testing
* low molecular weight heparin once a fetal heart is seen on ultrasound. This is usually discontinued at 34 weeks gestation
* these interventions increase the live birth rate seven\-fold
