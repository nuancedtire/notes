NICE updated their guidelines on the investigation and management of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 2020\. Some of the key changes include recommending the following:  
* the use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) as first\-line treatment for most people with VTE, including as interim anticoagulants before a definite diagnosis is made
* the use of DOACs in patients with active cancer, as opposed to low\-molecular weight heparin as was the previous recommendation
* routine cancer screening is no longer recommended following a VTE diagnosis

  
If a patient is suspected of having a DVT a two\-level DVT Wells score should be performed:  
  
Two\-level DVT Wells score
--------------------------

  


| **Clinical feature** | **Points** |
| --- | --- |
| Active cancer (treatment ongoing, within 6 months, or palliative) | 1 |
| Paralysis, paresis or recent plaster immobilisation of the lower extremities | 1 |
| Recently bedridden for 3 days or more or major surgery within 12 weeks requiring general or regional anaesthesia | 1 |
| Localised tenderness along the distribution of the deep venous system | 1 |
| Entire leg swollen | 1 |
| Calf swelling at least 3 cm larger than asymptomatic side | 1 |
| Pitting oedema confined to the symptomatic leg | 1 |
| Collateral superficial veins (non\-varicose) | 1 |
| Previously documented DVT | 1 |
| An alternative diagnosis is at least as likely as DVT | \-2 |

  
Clinical probability simplified score  
* DVT likely: 2 points or more
* DVT unlikely: 1 point or less

  
If a DVT is 'likely' (2 points or more)  
* a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be carried out within 4 hours
	+ if the result is positive then a diagnosis of DVT is made and anticoagulant treatment should start
	+ if the result is negative a D\-dimer test should be arranged. A negative scan and negative D\-dimer makes the diagnosis unlikely and alternative diagnoses should be considered
* if a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan cannot be carried out within 4 hours a D\-dimer test should be performed and interim therapeutic anticoagulation administered whilst waiting for the proximal leg vein ultrasound scan (which should be performed within 24 hours)
	+ interim therapeutic anticoagulation used to mean giving low\-molecular weight heparin
	+ NICE updated their guidance in 2020\. They now recommend using an anticoagulant that can be continued if the result is positive.
	+ this means normally a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) such as apixaban or rivaroxaban
* if the scan is negative but the D\-dimer is positive:
	+ stop interim therapeutic anticoagulation
	+ offer a repeat proximal leg vein ultrasound scan 6 to 8 days later

  
If a DVT is 'unlikely' (1 point or less)  
* perform a D\-dimer test
	+ this should be done within 4 hours. If not, interim therapeutic anticoagulation should be given until the result is available
	+ if the result is negative then DVT is unlikely and alternative diagnoses should be considered
	+ if the result is positive then a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan should be carried out within 4 hours
	+ if a proximal leg vein ultrasound scan cannot be carried out within 4 hours interim therapeutic anticoagulation should be administered whilst waiting for the proximal leg vein ultrasound scan (which should be performed within 24 hours)

  
D\-dimer tests  
* NICE recommend either a point\-of\-care (finger prick) or laboratory\-based test
* age\-adjusted cut\-offs should be used for patients \> 50 years old

Management
----------

  
The cornerstone of VTE management is anticoagulant therapy. This was historically done with warfarin, often preceded by heparin until the INR was stable. However, the development of DOACs, and an evidence base supporting their efficacy, has changed modern management.  
  
Choice of anticoagulant  
* the big change in the 2020 guidelines was the increased use of DOACs
* apixaban or rivaroxaban (both DOACs) should be offered first\-line following the diagnosis of a DVT
	+ instead of using low\-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) until the diagnosis is confirmed, NICE now advocate using a DOAC once a diagnosis is suspected, with this continued if the diagnosis is confirmed
	+ if neither apixaban or rivaroxaban are suitable then either LMWH followed by dabigatran or edoxaban OR LMWH followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA, i.e. warfarin)
* if the patient has active cancer
	+ previously LMWH was recommended
	+ the new guidelines now recommend using a DOAC, unless this is contraindicated
* if renal impairment is severe (e.g. \< 15/min) then LMWH, unfractionated heparin or LMWH followed by a VKA
* if the patient has antiphospholipid syndrome (specifically 'triple positive' in the guidance) then LMWH followed by a VKA should be used

  
Length of anticoagulation  
* all patients should have anticoagulation for at least 3 months
* continuing anticoagulation after this period is partly determined by whether the VTE was provoked or unprovoked
	+ a provoked VTE is due to an obvious precipitating event e.g. immobilisation following major surgery. The implication is that this event was transient and the patient is no longer at increased risk
	+ an unprovoked VTE occurs in the absence of an obvious precipitating event, i.e. there is a possibility that there are unknown factors (e.g. mild thrombophilia) making the patient more at risk from further clots
* if the VTE was provoked the treatment is typically stopped after the initial 3 months (3 to 6 months for people with active cancer)
* if the VTE was unprovoked then treatment is typically continued for up to 3 further months (i.e. 6 months in total)
	+ NICE recommend that whether a patient has a total of 3\-6 months anticoagulant is based upon balancing a person's risk of VTE recurrence and their risk of bleeding
	+ the ORBIT score can be used to help assess the risk of bleeding
	+ NICE state: '*Explain to people with unprovoked DVT or PE and a low bleeding risk that the benefits of continuing anticoagulation treatment are likely to outweigh the risks.* '. The implication of this is that in the absence of a bleeding risk factors, patients are generally better off continuing anticoagulation for a total of 6 months
