Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) may be divided in to 'warm' and 'cold' types, according to at what temperature the antibodies best cause haemolysis. It is most commonly idiopathic but may be secondary to a lymphoproliferative disorder, infection or drugs.   
  
Investigations  
* general features of haemolytic anaemia
	+ anaemia
	+ reticulocytosis
	+ low haptoglobin
	+ raised lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and indirect bilirubin
	+ blood film: spherocytes and reticulocytes
* specific features of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
	+ positive direct antiglobulin test (Coombs' test).

  
Warm AIHA
---------

  
Warm is the most common type of AIHA. In warm AIHA the antibody (usually IgG) causes haemolysis best at body temperature and haemolysis tends to occur in extravascular sites, for example the spleen.   
  
Causes of warm AIHA  
* idiopathic
* autoimmune disease: e.g. systemic lupus erythematosus\*
* neoplasia
	+ lymphoma
	+ chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
* drugs: e.g. methyldopa

  
Management   
* treatment of any underlying disorder
* steroids (\+/\- rituximab) are generally used first\-line

  
Cold AIHA
---------

  
The antibody in cold AIHA is usually IgM and causes haemolysis best at 4 deg C. Haemolysis is mediated by complement and is more commonly intravascular. Features may include symptoms of Raynaud's and acrocynaosis. Patients respond less well to steroids  
  
Causes of cold AIHA  
* neoplasia: e.g. lymphoma
* infections: e.g. mycoplasma, EBV

  
\*systemic lupus erythematosus can rarely be associated with a mixed\-type autoimmune haemolytic anaemia
