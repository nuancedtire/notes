NICE published guidelines on the use of blood products in 2015\.  
  
They recommended the following thresholds for transfusion:  
  


|  | Patients without ACS | Patients with ACS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transfusion threshold | 70 g/L | 80 g/L |
| Target after transfusion | 70\-90 g/L | 80\-100 g/L |

  
(ACS \= acute coronary syndrome)  
  
Please note that these thresholds should not be used in patients with ongoing major haemorrhage or patients who require regular blood transfusions for chronic anaemia.  
  
Practical points  
* red blood cells should be stored at 4Â°C prior to infusion
* in a non\-urgent scenario, a unit of RBC is usually transfused over 90\-120 minutes
