Polycythaemia may be relative, primary (polycythaemia rubra vera) or secondary  
  
Relative causes  
* dehydration
* stress: Gaisbock syndrome

  
Primary  
* polycythaemia rubra vera

  
Secondary causes  
* COPD
* altitude
* obstructive sleep apnoea
* excessive erythropoietin: cerebellar haemangioma, hypernephroma, hepatoma, uterine fibroids\*

  
To differentiate between true (primary or secondary) polycythaemia and relative polycythaemia red cell mass studies are sometimes used. In true polycythaemia the total red cell mass in males \> 35 ml/kg and in women \> 32 ml/kg  
  
\*uterine fibroids may cause menorrhagia which in turn leads to blood loss \- polycythaemia is rarely a clinical problem
