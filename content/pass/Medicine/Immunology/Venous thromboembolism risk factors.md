Common predisposing factors include malignancy, pregnancy and the period following an operation. The comprehensive list below is partly based on the 2010 SIGN venous thromboembolism (VTE) guidelines:  
  
General  
* increased risk with advancing age
* obesity
* family history of VTE
* pregnancy (especially puerperium)
* immobility
* hospitalisation
* anaesthesia
* central venous catheter: femoral \>\> subclavian

  
Underlying conditions  
* malignancy
* thrombophilia: e.g. Activated protein C resistance, protein C and S deficiency
* heart failure
* antiphospholipid syndrome
* Behcet's
* polycythaemia
* nephrotic syndrome
* sickle cell disease
* paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria
* hyperviscosity syndrome
* homocystinuria

  
Medication  
* combined oral contraceptive pill: 3rd generation more than 2nd generation
* hormone replacement therapy: the risk of VTE is higher in women taking oestrogen \+ progestogen preparations compared to those taking oestrogen\-only preparations
* raloxifene and tamoxifen
* antipsychotics (especially olanzapine) have recently been shown to be a risk factor

  
It should be remembered however that around 40% of patients diagnosed with a PE have no major risk factors.
