Acute phase proteins  
* CRP\*
* procalcitonin
* ferritin
* fibrinogen
* alpha\-1 antitrypsin
* caeruloplasmin
* serum amyloid A
* serum amyloid P component\*\*
* haptoglobin
* complement

  
During the acute phase response the liver decreases the production of other proteins (sometimes referred to as negative acute phase proteins). Examples include:  
* albumin
* transthyretin (formerly known as prealbumin)
* transferrin
* retinol binding protein
* cortisol binding protein

  
\*Levels of CRP are commonly measured in acutely unwell patients. CRP is a protein synthesised in the liver and binds to phosphocholine in bacterial cells and on those cells undergoing apoptosis. In binding to these cells it is then able to activate the complement system. CRP levels are known to rise in patients following surgery. However, levels of greater than 150 at 48 hours post operatively are suggestive of evolving complications.
