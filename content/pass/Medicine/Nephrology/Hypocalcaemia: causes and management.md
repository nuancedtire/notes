The clinical history combined with parathyroid hormone levels will reveal the cause of hypocalcaemia in the majority of cases  
  
Causes  
* vitamin D deficiency (osteomalacia)
* chronic kidney disease
* hypoparathyroidism (e.g. post thyroid/parathyroid surgery)
* pseudohypoparathyroidism (target cells insensitive to PTH)
* rhabdomyolysis (initial stages)
* magnesium deficiency (due to end organ PTH resistance)
* massive blood transfusion
* acute pancreatitis

  
Contamination of blood samples with EDTA may also give falsely low calcium levels.  
  
Management  
* severe hypocalcaemia (e.g. carpopedal spasm, tetany, seizures or prolonged QT interval) requires IV calcium replacement
	+ the preferred method is with intravenous calcium gluconate, 10ml of 10% solution over 10 minutes
	+ intravenous calcium chloride is more likely to cause local irritation
	+ ECG monitoring is recommended
* further management depends on the underlying cause
