Ezetimibe is a lipid\-lowering drug which inhibits cholesterol receptors on enterocytes, decreasing cholesterol absorption in the small intestine.  
  
NICE produced guidelines in 2016 on the use of **ezetimibe in primary heterozygous\-familial and non\-familial hypercholesterolaemia**  
* Ezetimibe monotherapy is recommended as an option for treating primary hypercholesterolaemia in adults in whom initial statin therapy is contraindicated or who cannot tolerate statin therapy
* Ezetimibe, coadministered with initial statin therapy, is recommended as an option for treating primary hypercholesterolaemia in adults who have started statin therapy when:
	+ serum total or LDL cholesterol concentration is not appropriately controlled either after appropriate dose titration of initial statin therapy or because dose titration is limited by intolerance to the initial statin therapy
	+ a change from initial statin therapy to an alternative statin is being considered.
