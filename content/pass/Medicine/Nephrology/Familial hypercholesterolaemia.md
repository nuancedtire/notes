Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant condition that is thought to affect around 1 in 500 people. It results in high levels of LDL\-cholesterol which, if untreated, may cause early cardiovascular disease (CVD). FH is caused by mutations in the gene which encodes the LDL\-receptor protein.  
  
Case finding:  
* NICE suggest that we should suspect FH as a possible diagnosis in adults with:
	+ a total cholesterol level greater than 7\.5 mmol/l and/or
	+ a personal or family history of premature coronary heart disease (an event before 60 years in an index individual or first\-degree relative)
* children of affected parents:
	+ if one parent is affected by familial hypercholesterolaemia, arrange testing in children by age 10
	+ if both parents are affected by familial hypercholesterolaemia, arrange testing in children by age 5

  
Clinical diagnosis is now based on the **Simon Broome criteria**:  
* in adults total cholesterol (TC) \> 7\.5 mmol/l and LDL\-C \> 4\.9 mmol/l or children TC \> 6\.7 mmol/l and LDL\-C \> 4\.0 mmol/l, plus:
* for definite FH: tendon xanthoma in patients or 1st or 2nd degree relatives or DNA\-based evidence of FH
* for possible FH: family history of myocardial infarction below age 50 years in 2nd degree relative, below age 60 in 1st degree relative, or a family history of raised cholesterol levels

  
Management  
* the use of CVD risk estimation using standard tables is not appropriate in FH as they do not accurately reflect the risk of CVD
* referral to a specialist lipid clinic is usually required
* high\-dose statins are usually used first\-line
* first\-degree relatives have a 50% chance of having the disorder and should therefore be offered screening. This includes children who should be screened by the age of 10 years if there is one affected parent
* statins should be discontinued in women 3 months before conception due to the risk of congenital defects
