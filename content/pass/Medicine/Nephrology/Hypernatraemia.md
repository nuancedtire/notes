Causes of hypernatraemia  
* dehydration
* osmotic diuresis e.g. hyperosmolar non\-ketotic diabetic coma
* diabetes insipidus
* excess IV saline

  
Hypernatraemia should be corrected with great caution. Although brain tissue can lose sodium and potassium rapidly, lowering of other osmolytes (and importantly water) occurs at a slower rate, predisposing to cerebral oedema, resulting in seizures, coma and death1\. Although there are no clinical guidelines by NICE or Royal College of Physicians at present, it is generally accepted that a rate of no greater than 0\.5 mmol/hour correction is appropriate1.
