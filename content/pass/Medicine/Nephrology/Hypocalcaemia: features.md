As extracellular calcium concentrations are important for muscle and nerve function many of the features seen in hypocalcaemia seen a result of neuromuscular excitability  
  
Features  
* tetany: muscle twitching, cramping and spasm
* perioral paraesthesia
* if chronic: depression, cataracts
* ECG: prolonged QT interval

  
Trousseau's sign  
* carpal spasm if the brachial artery occluded by inflating the blood pressure cuff and maintaining pressure above systolic
* wrist flexion and fingers are drawn together
* seen in around 95% of patients with hypocalcaemia and around 1% of normocalcaemic people

  
Chvostek's sign  
* tapping over parotid causes facial muscles to twitch
* seen in around 70% of patients with hypocalcaemia and around 10% of normocalcaemic people
