Potassium and hydrogen can be thought of as competitors. Hyperkalaemia tends to be associated with acidosis because as potassium levels rise fewer hydrogen ions can enter the cells  
  
Hypokalaemia with alkalosis  
* vomiting
* thiazide and loop diuretics
* Cushing's syndrome
* Conn's syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism)

  
Hypokalaemia with acidosis  
* diarrhoea
* renal tubular acidosis
* acetazolamide
* partially treated diabetic ketoacidosis

  
Magnesium deficiency may also cause hypokalaemia. In such cases, normalizing the potassium level may be difficult until the magnesium deficiency has been corrected
