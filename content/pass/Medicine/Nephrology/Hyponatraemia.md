Hyponatraemia may be caused by water excess or sodium depletion. Causes of pseudohyponatraemia include hyperlipidaemia (increase in serum volume) or a taking blood from a drip arm. Urinary sodium and osmolarity levels aid making a diagnosis  
  
Urinary sodium \> 20 mmol/l
---------------------------

  
Sodium depletion, renal loss (patient often hypovolaemic)  
* diuretics: thiazides, loop diuretics
* Addison's disease
* diuretic stage of renal failure

  
Patient often euvolaemic  
* SIADH (urine osmolality \> 500 mmol/kg)
* hypothyroidism

  
  
Urinary sodium \< 20 mmol/l
---------------------------

  
Sodium depletion, extra\-renal loss  
* diarrhoea, vomiting, sweating
* burns, adenoma of rectum

  
Water excess (patient often hypervolaemic and oedematous)  
* secondary hyperaldosteronism: heart failure, liver cirrhosis
* nephrotic syndrome
* IV dextrose
* psychogenic polydipsia
