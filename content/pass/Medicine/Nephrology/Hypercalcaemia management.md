The initial management of hypercalcaemia is rehydration with normal saline, typically 3\-4 litres/day. Following rehydration bisphosphonates may be used. They typically take 2\-3 days to work with maximal effect being seen at 7 days  
  
Other options include:  
* calcitonin \- quicker effect than bisphosphonates
* steroids in sarcoidosis

  
Loop diuretics such as furosemide are sometimes used in hypercalcaemia, particularly in patients who cannot tolerate aggressive fluid rehydration. However, they should be used with caution as they may worsen electrolyte derangement and volume depletion.
