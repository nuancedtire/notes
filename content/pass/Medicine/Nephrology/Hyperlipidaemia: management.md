In 2014 NICE updated their guidelines on lipid modification. This proved highly controversial as it meant that we should be recommending statins to a significant proportion of the population over the age of 60 years. Anyway, the key points of the new guidelines are summarised below.

Primary prevention \- who and how to assess risk
------------------------------------------------

  
A systematic strategy should be used to identify people aged over 40 years who are likely to be at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), defined as a 10\-year risk of **10%** or greater.   
  
NICE recommend we use the **QRISK2** CVD risk assessment tool for patients aged \<\= 84 years. Patients \>\= 85 years are at high risk of CVD due to their age. QRISK2 should not be used in the following situations as there are more specific guidelines for these patient groups:  
* type 1 diabetics
* patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 ml/min and/or albuminuria
* patients with a history of familial hyperlipidaemia

  
NICE suggest QRISK2 may underestimate CVD risk in the following population groups:  
* people treated for HIV
* people with serious mental health problems
* people taking medicines that can cause dyslipidaemia such as antipsychotics, corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs
* people with autoimmune disorders/systemic inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus

  
  
Measuring lipid levels
----------------------

  
When measuring lipids both the total cholesterol and HDL should be checked to provide the most accurate risk of CVD. A full lipid profile should also be checked (i.e. including triglycerides) before starting a statin. The samples do not need to be fasting.  
  
In the vast majority of patients the cholesterol measurements will be fed into the QRISK2 tool. If however, the patient's cholesterol is very high we should consider familial hyperlipidaemia. NICE recommend the following that we should consider the possibility of familial hypercholesterolaemia and investigate further if:  
* the total cholesterol level greater than 7\.5 mmol/L and/or
* there is a personal or family history of premature coronary heart disease (an event before 60 years in an index person or first\-degree relative \[parents, siblings, children])

  
  
Interpreting the QRISK2 result
------------------------------

  
Probably the headline change in the 2014 guidelines was the new, lower cut\-off of 10\-year CVD risk cut\-off of 10%.   
  
NICE now recommend we offer a statin to people with a QRISK2 10\-year risk of \>\= 10%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Lifestyle factors are of course important and NICE recommend that we give patients the option of having their CVD risk reassessed after a period of time before starting a statin.  
  
Atorvastatin 20mg should be offered first\-line.  
  
  
Special situations
------------------

  
Type 1 diabetes mellitus  
* NICE recommend that we 'consider statin treatment for the primary prevention of CVD in all adults with type 1 diabetes'
* atorvastatin 20 mg should be offered if type 1 diabetics who are:
	+ older than 40 years, or
	+ have had diabetes for more than 10 years or
	+ have established nephropathy or
	+ have other CVD risk factors

  
Chronic kidney disease (CKD)  
* atorvastatin 20mg should be offered to patients with CKD
* increase the dose if a greater than 40% reduction in non\-HDL cholesterol is not achieved and the eGFR \> 30 ml/min. If the eGFR is \< 30 ml/min a renal specialist should be consulted before increasing the dose

  
Secondary prevention
--------------------

  
All patients with CVD should be taking a statin in the absence of any contraindication.  
  
Atorvastatin 80mg should be offered first\-line.  
  
  
Follow\-up of people started on statins
---------------------------------------

  
NICE recommend we follow up patients at 3 months  
* repeat a full lipid profile
* if the non\-HDL cholesterol has not fallen by at least 40% concordance and lifestyle changes should be discussed with the patient
* NICE recommend we consider increasing the dose of atorvastatin up to 80mg

  
Lifestyle modifications
-----------------------

  
These are in many ways predictable but NICE make a number of specific points:  
  
Cardioprotective diet  
* total fat intake should be \<\= 30% of total energy intake
* saturated fats should be \<\= 7% of total energy intake
* intake of dietary cholesterol should be \< 300 mg/day
* saturated fats should be replaced by monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats where possible
* replace saturated and monounsaturated fat intake with olive oil, rapeseed oil or spreads based on these oils
* choose wholegrain varieties of starchy food
* reduce their intake of sugar and food products containing refined sugars including fructose
* eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables per day
* eat at least 2 portions of fish per week, including a portion of oily fish
* eat at least 4 to 5 portions of unsalted nuts, seeds and legumes per week

  
Physical activity  
* each week aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate\-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous\-intensity aerobic activity or a mix of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity
* do muscle\-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms) in line with national guidance for the general population

  
Weight management  
* no specific advice is given, overweight patients should be managed in keeping with relevant NICE guidance

  
Alcohol intake  
* again no specific advice, other than the general recommendation: men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis

  
Smoking cessation  
* smokers should be encouraged to quit
