Guillain\-Barre syndrome describes an immune\-mediated demyelination of the peripheral nervous system often triggered by an infection (classically *Campylobacter jejuni*)  
  
Pathogenesis  
* cross\-reaction of antibodies with gangliosides in the peripheral nervous system
* correlation between anti\-ganglioside antibody (e.g. anti\-GM1\) and clinical features has been demonstrated
* anti\-GM1 antibodies in 25% of patients

  
Miller Fisher syndrome  
* variant of Guillain\-Barre syndrome
* associated with ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia. The eye muscles are typically affected first
* usually presents as a descending paralysis rather than ascending as seen in other forms of Guillain\-Barre syndrome
* anti\-GQ1b antibodies are present in 90% of cases
