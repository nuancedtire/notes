Strokes represent an important cause of morbidity and mortality. In the UK alone there are over 150,000 strokes per year, with over 1\.2 million stroke survivors. Stroke is the fourth largest cause of death in the UK and kills twice as many women than breast cancer each year.  
  
The prevention and treatment of strokes has undergone significant changes over the past decade. What was previously considered a devastating but untreatable condition is now viewed more as a 'brain attack', a condition which requires emergency assessment to see if patients may benefit from new treatments such as thrombolysis.

What is a stroke?
-----------------

  
A stroke (also known as cerebrovascular accident, CVA) represents a sudden interruption in the vascular supply of the brain. Remember that neural tissue is completely dependent on aerobic metabolism so any problem with oxygen supply can quickly lead to irreversible damage.  
  
There are two main types of strokes:  
* ischaemic
	+ a subtype of ischaemic stroke is a transient ischaemic attack (TIA). This describes the sudden onset of a focal neurologic symptom and/or sign lasting typically less than an hour, brought on by a transient decrease in blood flow. This is sometimes referred to by patients as a 'mini\-stroke'
* haemorrhagic

  
The table below shows the basic differences:  
  


|  | Ischaemic | Haemorrhagic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Essential problem** | 'Blockage' in the blood vessel stops blood flow | Blood vessel 'bursts' leading to reduction in blood flow |
| **Proportion of strokes** | 85% | 15% |
| **Subtypes** | Thrombotic stroke* thrombosis from large vessels e.g. carotid  Embolic stroke* usually a blood clot but fat, air or clumps of bacteria may act as an embolus * atrial fibrillation is an important cause of emboli forming in the heart | Intracerebral haemorrhage* bleeding within the brain  Subarachnoid haemorrhage * bleeding on the surface of the brain |
| **Risk factors** | General risk factors for cardiovascular disease* age * hypertension * smoking * hyperlipidaemia * diabetes mellitus  Risk factors for cardioembolism* atrial fibrillation | Risk factors* age * hypertension * arteriovenous malformation * anticoagulation therapy |

  
  
Symptoms and signs
------------------

  
Stroke may be defined as a clinical syndrome consisting of rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (at times global) disturbance of cerebral function caused by a vascular problem.  
  
Features include:  
* motor weakness
* speech problems (dysphasia)
* swallowing problems
* visual field defects (homonymous hemianopia)
* balance problems

  
Cerebral hemisphere infarcts may have the following symptoms:  
* contralateral hemiplegia: initially flaccid then spastic
* contralateral sensory loss
* homonymous hemianopia
* dysphasia

  
Brainstem infarction  
* may result in more severe symptoms including quadriplegia and lock\-in\-syndrome

  
Lacunar infarcts  
* small infarcts around the basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus and pons
* this may result in pure motor, pure sensory, mixed motor and sensory signs or ataxia

One formal classification system that is sometimes used is the **Oxford Stroke Classification** (also known as the Bamford Classification), whichclassifies strokes based on the initial symptoms. A summary is as follows:  
  
The following criteria should be assessed:  
* 1\. unilateral hemiparesis and/or hemisensory loss of the face, arm \& leg
* 2\. homonymous hemianopia
* 3\. higher cognitive dysfunction e.g. dysphasia

  


| Stroke type | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Total anterior circulation infarcts (TACI, c. 15%) | * involves middle and anterior cerebral arteries * all 3 of the above criteria are present |
| Partial anterior circulation infarcts (PACI, c. 25%) | * involves smaller arteries of anterior circulation e.g. upper or lower division of middle cerebral artery * 2 of the above criteria are present |
| Lacunar infarcts (LACI, c. 25%) | * involves perforating arteries around the internal capsule, thalamus and basal ganglia * presents with 1 of the following: * 1\. unilateral weakness (and/or sensory deficit) of face and arm, arm and leg or all three. * 2\. pure sensory stroke. * 3\. ataxic hemiparesis |
| Posterior circulation infarcts (POCI, c. 25%) | * involves vertebrobasilar arteries * presents with 1 of the following: * 1\. cerebellar or brainstem syndromes * 2\. loss of consciousness * 3\. isolated homonymous hemianopia |

  
Whilst symptoms alone cannot be used to differentiate haemorrhagic from ischaemic strokes, patients who've suffered haemorrhages are more likely to have:  
* decrease in the level of consciousness: seen in up to 50% of patients with a haemorrhagic stroke
* headache is also much more common in haemorrhagic stroke
* nausea and vomiting is also common
* seizures occur in up to 25% of patients

Over recent years there has been a public health campaign to raise awareness of stroke symptoms. The **FAST campaign** uses the following mnemonic:  
* **F**ace \- 'Has their face fallen on one side? Can they smile?'
* **A**rms \- 'Can they raise both arms and keep them there?'
* **S**peech \- 'Is their speech slurred?'
* **T**time \- 'Time to call 999 if you see any single one of these signs.'

  
  
Investigations
--------------

  
Patients with suspected stroke need to have emergency neuroimaging. The main cause for urgency is to see whether a patient may be suitable for thrombolytic therapy to treat early ischaemic strokes. The two types of neuroimaging used in this setting are:  
* CT
* MRI

Management
----------

  
**Ischaemic strokes**  
  
Urgent neuroimaging classifies the stroke as either ischaemic or haemorrhagic. If the stroke is ischaemic, and certain criteria are met, the patient should be offered thrombolysis. Example criteria include:  
* patients present with 4\.5 hours of onset of stroke symptoms
* the patient has not had a previous intracranial haemorrhage, uncontrolled hypertension, pregnant etc

  
Once haemorrhagic stroke has been excluded patients should be given aspirin 300mg as soon as possible and antiplatelet therapy should be continued.  
  
Transient ischaemic attacks
---------------------------

  
Remember with TIAs the, by definition, symptoms last less than 24 hours although in the vast majority of cases the duration is much shorter, typically 1 hour or so. For this reason most patients symptoms will have resolved before they see a doctor.  
  
The ABCD2 prognostic score has previously been used to risk stratify patients who present with a suspected TIA. However, data from studies have suggested it performs poorly and it is therefore no longer recommended by NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries. Instead, NICE recommend:  
  
Immediate antithrombotic therapy:  
* give aspirin 300 mg immediately, unless contraindicated e.g. the patient has a bleeding disorder or is taking an anticoagulant (needs immediate admission for imaging to exclude a haemorrhage)

  
If the patient has had more than 1 TIA ('crescendo TIA') or has a suspected cardioembolic source or severe carotid stenosis:  
* discuss the need for admission or observation urgently with a stroke specialist

  
If the patient has had a suspected TIA in the last 7 days:  
* arrange urgent assessment (within 24 hours) by a specialist stroke physician

  
If the patient has had a suspected TIA which occurred more than a week previously:  
* refer for specialist assessment as soon as possible within 7 days

  
Haemorrhagic strokes
--------------------

  
If imaging confirms a haemorrhagic stroke neurosurgical consultation should be considered for advice on further management. The vast majority of patients however are not suitable for surgical intervention. Management is therefore supportive as per haemorrhagic stroke. Anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin) and antithrombotic medications (e.g. clopidogrel) should be stopped to minimise further bleeding. If a patient is anticoagulated this should be reversed as quickly as possible. Trials have shown improved outcomes in patients who have their blood pressure lowered acutely and this is now part of many protocols for haemorrhagic strokes.
