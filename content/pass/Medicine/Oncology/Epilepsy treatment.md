Most neurologists now start antiepileptics following a second epileptic seizure. NICE guidelines suggest starting antiepileptics after the first seizure if any of the following are present:  
* the patient has a neurological deficit
* brain imaging shows a structural abnormality
* the EEG shows unequivocal epileptic activity
* the patient or their family or carers consider the risk of having a further seizure unacceptable

  
It should be remembered that the following are only general guidelines. For example, **maternal use of sodium valproate is associated with a significant risk of neurodevelopmental delay in children**. Guidance is now clear that sodium valproate should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age unless clearly necessary.   
  
Drug treatment according to the type of epilepsy
------------------------------------------------

  
Generalised tonic\-clonic seizures  
* males: sodium valproate
* females: lamotrigine or levetiracetam
* girls aged under 10 years and who are unlikely to need treatment when they are old enough to have children or women who are unable to have children may be offered sodium valproate first\-line

  
Focal seizures  
* first line: lamotrigine or levetiracetam
* second line: carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine or zonisamide

  
Absence seizures (Petit mal)  
* first line: ethosuximide
* second line:
	+ male: sodium valproate
	+ female: lamotrigine or levetiracetam
* carbamazepine may exacerbate absence seizures

  
Myoclonic seizures  
* males: sodium valproate
* females: levetiracetam

  
Tonic or atonic seizures  
* males: sodium valproate
* females: lamotrigine
