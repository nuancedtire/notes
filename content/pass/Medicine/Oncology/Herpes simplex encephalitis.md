Herpes simplex (HSV) encephalitis is a common topic in the exam. The virus characteristically affects the temporal lobes \- questions may give the result of imaging or describe temporal lobe signs e.g. aphasia.  
  
Features  
* fever, headache, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, vomiting
* focal features e.g. aphasia
* peripheral lesions (e.g. cold sores) have no relation to the presence of HSV encephalitis

  
Pathophysiology  
* HSV\-1 is responsible for 95% of cases in adults
* typically affects temporal and inferior frontal lobes

  
Investigation  
* CSF: lymphocytosis, elevated protein
* PCR for HSV
* CT: medial temporal and inferior frontal changes (e.g. petechial haemorrhages) \- normal in one\-third of patients
* MRI is better
* EEG pattern: lateralised periodic discharges at 2 Hz

  
Treatment  
* intravenous aciclovir

  
The prognosis is dependent on whether aciclovir is commenced early. If treatment is started promptly the mortality is 10\-20%. Left untreated the mortality approaches 80%

MRI of a patient with HSV encephalitis. There is hyperintensity of the affected white matter and cortex in the medial temporal lobes and insular cortex.
