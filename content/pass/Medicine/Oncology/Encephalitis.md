Features  
* fever, headache, psychiatric symptoms, seizures, vomiting
* focal features e.g. aphasia
* peripheral lesions (e.g. cold sores) have no relation to the presence of HSV encephalitis

  
Pathophysiology  
* HSV\-1 is responsible for 95% of cases in adults
* typically affects temporal and inferior frontal lobes

  
Investigation  
* cerebrospinal fluid
	+ lymphocytosis
	+ elevated protein
	+ PCR for HSV, VZV and enteroviruses
* neuroimaging
	+ medial temporal and inferior frontal changes (e.g. petechial haemorrhages)
	+ normal in one\-third of patients
	+ MRI is better
* EEG
	+ lateralised periodic discharges at 2 Hz

  
Management  
* intravenous aciclovir should be started in all cases of suspected encephalitis
