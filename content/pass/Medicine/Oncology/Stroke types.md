The **Oxford Stroke Classification** (also known as the Bamford Classification) classifies strokes based on the initial symptoms. A summary is as follows:  
  
The following criteria should be assessed:  
* 1\. unilateral hemiparesis and/or hemisensory loss of the face, arm \& leg
* 2\. homonymous hemianopia
* 3\. higher cognitive dysfunction e.g. dysphasia

  
Total anterior circulation infarcts (TACI, c. 15%)  
* involves middle and anterior cerebral arteries
* all 3 of the above criteria are present

  
Partial anterior circulation infarcts (PACI, c. 25%)  
* involves smaller arteries of anterior circulation e.g. upper or lower division of middle cerebral artery
* 2 of the above criteria are present

  
Lacunar infarcts (LACI, c. 25%)  
* involves perforating arteries around the internal capsule, thalamus and basal ganglia
* presents with 1 of the following:
* 1\. unilateral weakness (and/or sensory deficit) of face and arm, arm and leg or all three.
* 2\. pure sensory stroke.
* 3\. ataxic hemiparesis

  
Posterior circulation infarcts (POCI, c. 25%)  
* involves vertebrobasilar arteries
* presents with 1 of the following:
* 1\. cerebellar or brainstem syndromes
* 2\. loss of consciousness
* 3\. isolated homonymous hemianopia

  
Other recognised patterns of stroke:
------------------------------------

  
Lateral medullary syndrome (posterior inferior cerebellar artery)  
* aka Wallenberg's syndrome
* ipsilateral: ataxia, nystagmus, dysphagia, facial numbness, cranial nerve palsy e.g. Horner's
* contralateral: limb sensory loss

  
Weber's syndrome  
* ipsilateral III palsy
* contralateral weakness
