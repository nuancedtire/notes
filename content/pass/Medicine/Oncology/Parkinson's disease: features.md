Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The reduction in dopaminergic output results in a classical triad of features: bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. The symptoms of Parkinson's disease are characteristically asymmetrical.  
  
Epidemiology  
* around twice as common in men
* mean age of diagnosis is 65 years

  
Bradykinesia  
* poverty of movement also seen, sometimes referred to as hypokinesia
* short, shuffling steps with reduced arm swinging
* difficulty in initiating movement

  
Tremor  
* most marked at rest, 3\-5 Hz
* worse when stressed or tired, improves with voluntary movement
* typically 'pill\-rolling', i.e. in the thumb and index finger

  
Rigidity  
* lead pipe
* cogwheel: due to superimposed tremor

  
Other characteristic features  
* mask\-like facies
* flexed posture
* micrographia
* drooling of saliva
* psychiatric features: depression is the most common feature (affects about 40%); dementia, psychosis and sleep disturbances may also occur
* impaired olfaction
* REM sleep behaviour disorder
* fatigue
* autonomic dysfunction:
	+ postural hypotension

  
**Drug\-induced parkinsonism** has slightly different features to Parkinson's disease:  
* motor symptoms are generally rapid onset and bilateral
* rigidity and rest tremor are uncommon

  
Diagnosis is usually clinical. However, if there is difficulty differentiating between essential tremor and Parkinson's disease NICE recommend considering 123I\-FP\-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
