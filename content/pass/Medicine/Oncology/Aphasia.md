The table below lists the major types of aphasia. Remember that dysarthria is different and refers to a motor speech disorder.  
  


| **Type of aphasia** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- |
| Wernicke's (receptive) aphasia | Due to a lesion of the superior temporal gyrus. It is typically supplied by the inferior division of the left MCA This area 'forms' the speech before 'sending it' to Broca's area. Lesions result in sentences that make no sense, word substitution and neologisms but speech remains fluent \- 'word salad'Comprehension is impaired |
| Broca's (expressive) aphasia | Due to a lesion of the inferior frontal gyrus. It is typically supplied by the superior division of the left MCA Speech is non\-fluent, laboured, and halting. Repetition is impairedComprehension is normal |
| Conduction aphasia | Classically due to a stroke affecting the arcuate fasiculus \- the connection between Wernicke's and Broca's areaSpeech is fluent but repetition is poor. Aware of the errors they are makingComprehension is normal |
| Global aphasia | Large lesion affecting all 3 of the above areas resulting in severe expressive and receptive aphasiaMay still be able to communicate using gestures |
