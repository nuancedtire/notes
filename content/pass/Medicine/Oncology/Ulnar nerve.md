Overview  
* arises from medial cord of brachial plexus (C8, T1\)

  
Motor to  
* medial two lumbricals
* aDductor pollicis
* interossei
* hypothenar muscles: abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi
* flexor carpi ulnaris

  
Sensory to  
* medial 1 1/2 fingers (palmar and dorsal aspects)

  
Path  
* the ulnar nerve travels through the posteromedial aspect of the upper arm to the flexor compartment of the forearm
* it then enters the palm of the hand via the Guyon's canal, superficial to the flexor retinaculum and lateral to the pisiform bone

Branches
--------

  


| **Branch** | **Supplies** |
| --- | --- |
| Muscular branch | Flexor carpi ulnarisMedial half of the flexor digitorum profundus |
| Palmar cutaneous branch (Arises near the middle of the forearm) | Skin on the medial part of the palm |
| Dorsal cutaneous branch | Dorsal surface of the medial part of the hand |
| Superficial branch | Cutaneous fibres to the anterior surfaces of the medial one and one\-half digits |
| Deep branch | Hypothenar musclesAll the interosseous muscles Third and fourth lumbricals Adductor pollicisMedial head of the flexor pollicis brevis |

  
Patterns of damage
------------------

  
Damage at wrist  
* 'claw hand' \- hyperextension of the metacarpophalangeal joints and flexion at the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the 4th and 5th digits
* wasting and paralysis of intrinsic hand muscles (except lateral two lumbricals)
* wasting and paralysis of hypothenar muscles
* sensory loss to the medial 1 1/2 fingers (palmar and dorsal aspects)

  
Damage at elbow  
* as above (however, ulnar paradox \- clawing is more severe in distal lesions)
* radial deviation of wrist
