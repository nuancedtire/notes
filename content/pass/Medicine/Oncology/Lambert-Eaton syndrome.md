Lambert\-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is seen in association with small cell lung cancer and to a lesser extent breast and ovarian cancer. It may also occur independently as an autoimmune disorder. Lambert\-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is caused by an antibody directed against presynaptic voltage\-gated calcium channel  in the peripheral nervous system.  
  
Features  
* repeated muscle contractions lead to increased muscle strength (in contrast to myasthenia gravis)
	+ in reality, this is seen in only 50% of patients and following prolonged muscle use muscle strength will eventually decrease
* limb\-girdle weakness (affects lower limbs first)
* hyporeflexia
* autonomic symptoms: dry mouth, impotence, difficulty micturating
* ophthalmoplegia and ptosis not commonly a feature (unlike in myasthenia gravis)

  
EMG  
* incremental response to repetitive electrical stimulation

  
Management  
* treatment of underlying cancer
* immunosuppression, for example with prednisolone and/or azathioprine
* 3,4\-diaminopyridine is currently being trialled
	+ works by blocking potassium channel efflux in the nerve terminal so that the action potential duration is increased. Calcium channels can then be open for a longer time and allow greater acetylcholine release to the stimulate muscle at the end plate
* intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and plasma exchange may be beneficial
