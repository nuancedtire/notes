Guillain\-Barre syndrome describes an immune\-mediated demyelination of the peripheral nervous system often triggered by an infection (classically *Campylobacter jejuni*).   
  
Initial symptoms  
* around 65% of patients experience back/leg pain in the initial stages of the illness

  
The characteristic features of Guillain\-Barre syndrome is progressive, symmetrical weakness of all the limbs.   
* the weakness is classically **ascending** i.e. the legs are affected first
* reflexes are reduced or absent
* sensory symptoms tend to be mild (e.g. distal paraesthesia) with very few sensory signs

  
Other features  
* there may be a history of gastroenteritis
* respiratory muscle weakness
* cranial nerve involvement
	+ diplopia
	+ bilateral facial nerve palsy
	+ oropharyngeal weakness is common
* autonomic involvement
	+ urinary retention
	+ diarrhoea

  
Less common findings  
* papilloedema: thought to be secondary to reduced CSF resorption

  
Investigations  
* lumbar puncture
	+ rise in protein with a normal white blood cell count (albuminocytologic dissociation) \- found in 66%
* nerve conduction studies may be performed
	+ decreased motor nerve conduction velocity (due to demyelination)
	+ prolonged distal motor latency
	+ increased F wave latency
