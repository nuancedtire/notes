Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a syndrome of spontaneous, continuous lower limb movements that may be associated with paraesthesia. It is extremely common, affecting between 2\-10% of the general population. Males and females are equally affected and a family history may be present  
  
Clinical features  
* uncontrollable urge to move legs (akathisia). Symptoms initially occur at night but as condition progresses may occur during the day. Symptoms are worse at rest
* paraesthesias e.g. 'crawling' or 'throbbing' sensations
* movements during sleep may be noted by the partner \- periodic limb movements of sleeps (PLMS)

  
Causes and associations  
* there is a positive family history in 50% of patients with idiopathic RLS
* iron deficiency anaemia
* uraemia
* diabetes mellitus
* pregnancy

  
The diagnosis is clinical although bloods such as ferritin to exclude iron deficiency anaemia may be appropriate  
  
Management  
* simple measures: walking, stretching, massaging affected limbs
* treat any iron deficiency
* dopamine agonists are first\-line treatment (e.g. Pramipexole, ropinirole)
* benzodiazepines
* gabapentin
