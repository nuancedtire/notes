Wernicke's encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric disorder caused by thiamine deficiency which is most commonly seen in alcoholics. Rarer causes include persistent vomiting, stomach cancer, and dietary deficiency. A classic triad of ophthalmoplegia/nystagmus, ataxia and encephalopathy may occur.   
  
In Wernicke's encephalopathy, petechial haemorrhages occur in a variety of structures in the brain including the mamillary bodies and ventricle walls.  
  
Features  
* oculomotor dysfunction
	+ nystagmus (the most common ocular sign)
	+ ophthalmoplegia: lateral rectus palsy, conjugate gaze palsy
* gait ataxia
* encephalopathy: confusion, disorientation, indifference, and inattentiveness
* peripheral sensory neuropathy

  
Investigations  
* decreased red cell transketolase
* MRI

  
Treatment is with urgent replacement of thiamine  
  
Relationship with Korsakoff syndrome
------------------------------------

  
If not treated Korsakoff's syndrome may develop as well. This is termed Wernicke\-Korsakoff syndrome and is characterised by the addition of antero\- and retrograde amnesia and confabulation in addition to the above symptoms.
