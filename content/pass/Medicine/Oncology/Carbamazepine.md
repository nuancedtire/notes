* trigeminal neuralgia
* bipolar disorder

  
Mechanism of action  
* binds to sodium channels increases their refractory period

  
Adverse effects  
* P450 enzyme inducer
* dizziness and ataxia
* drowsiness
* headache
* visual disturbances (especially diplopia)
* Steven\-Johnson syndrome
* leucopenia and agranulocytosis
