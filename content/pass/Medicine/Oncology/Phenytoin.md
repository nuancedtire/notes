Phenytoin is used in the management of seizures.  
  
Mechanism of action  
* binds to sodium channels increasing their refractory period

  
Adverse effects
---------------

  
Phenytoin is associated with a large number of adverse effects. These may be divided into acute, chronic, idiosyncratic and teratogenic. Phenytoin is also an inducer of the P450 system.  
  
Acute  
* initially: dizziness, diplopia, nystagmus, slurred speech, ataxia
* later: confusion, seizures

  
Chronic  
* common: gingival hyperplasia (secondary to increased expression of platelet derived growth factor, PDGF), hirsutism, coarsening of facial features, drowsiness
* megaloblastic anaemia (secondary to altered folate metabolism)
* peripheral neuropathy
* enhanced vitamin D metabolism causing osteomalacia
* lymphadenopathy
* dyskinesia

  
Idiosyncratic  
* fever
* rashes, including severe reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis
* hepatitis
* Dupuytren's contracture\*
* aplastic anaemia
* drug\-induced lupus

  
Teratogenic  
* associated with cleft palate and congenital heart disease

  
Monitoring
----------

  
Phenytoin levels do not need to be monitored routinely but **trough levels, immediately before dose** should be checked if:  
* adjustment of phenytoin dose
* suspected toxicity
* detection of non\-adherence to the prescribed medication
