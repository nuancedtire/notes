Friedreich's ataxia is the most common of the early\-onset hereditary ataxias. It is an autosomal recessive, trinucleotide repeat disorder characterised by a GAA repeat in the X25 gene on chromosome 9 (frataxin). Friedreich's ataxia is unusual amongst trinucleotide repeat disorders in not demonstrating the phenomenon of anticipation.  
  
The typical age of onset is 10\-15 years old. Gait ataxia and kyphoscoliosis are the most common presenting features.  
  
Neurological features  
* absent ankle jerks/extensor plantars
* cerebellar ataxia
* optic atrophy
* spinocerebellar tract degeneration

  
Other features  
* hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (90%, most common cause of death)
* diabetes mellitus (10\-20%)
* high\-arched palate

Comparison of Friedreich's ataxia and ataxic telangiectasia. Note in particular how ataxic telangiectasia tends to present much earlier, often at the age of 1\-2 years
