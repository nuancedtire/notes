Genetics  
* autosomal dominant
* trinucleotide repeat disorder: repeat expansion of CAG
	+ as Huntington's disease is a trinucleotide repeat disorder, the phenomenon of anticipation may be seen, where the disease is presents at an earlier age in successive generations
* results in degeneration of cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the striatum of the basal ganglia
* due to defect in huntingtin gene on chromosome 4

  
Features typical develop after 35 years of age  
* chorea
* personality changes (e.g. irritability, apathy, depression) and intellectual impairment
* dystonia
* saccadic eye movements
