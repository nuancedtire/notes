Causes of Parkinsonism  
* Parkinson's disease
* drug\-induced e.g. antipsychotics, metoclopramide\*
* progressive supranuclear palsy
* multiple system atrophy
* Wilson's disease
* post\-encephalitis
* dementia pugilistica (secondary to chronic head trauma e.g. boxing)
* toxins: carbon monoxide, MPTP

  
\*Domperidone does not cross the blood\-brain barrier and therefore does not cause extra\-pyramidal side\-effects.
