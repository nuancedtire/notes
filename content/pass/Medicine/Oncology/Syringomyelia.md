Syringomyelia ('syrinx' for short) describes a collection of cerebrospinal fluid within the spinal cord.   
  
Syringobulbia is a similar phenomenon in which there is a fluid\-filled cavity within the medulla of the brainstem. This is often an extension of the syringomyelia but in rare cases can be an isolated finding.   
  
Causes include:  
* a Chiari malformation: strong association
* trauma
* tumours
* idiopathic

  
Features  
* a 'cape\-like' (neck, shoulders and arms)
	+ loss of sensation to temperature but the preservation of light touch, proprioception and vibration
	+ classic examples are of patients who accidentally burn their hands without realising
	+ this is due to the crossing spinothalamic tracts in the anterior commissure of the spinal cord being the first tracts to be affected
* spastic weakness (predominantly of the lower limbs)
* neuropathic pain
* upgoing plantars
* autonomic features:
* Horner's syndrome due to compression of the sympathetic chain, but this is rare
	+ bowel and bladder dysfunction
* scoliosis will occur over a matter of years if the syrinx is not treated

  
Investigations  
* full spine MRI with contrast to exclude a tumour or tethered cord
* a brain MRI is also needed to exclude a Chiari malformation

  
Treatment will be directed at treating the cause of the syrinx. In patients with a persistent or symptomatic syrinx, a shunt into the syrinx can be placed.
