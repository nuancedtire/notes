It rarely presents before 40 years and various patterns of disease are recognised including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive muscular atrophy and bulbar palsy  
  
Riluzole  
* prevents stimulation of glutamate receptors
* used mainly in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
* prolongs life by about 3 months

  
Respiratory care  
* non\-invasive ventilation (usually BIPAP) is used at night
* studies have shown a survival benefit of around 7 months

  
Nutrition  
* percutaneous gastrostomy tube (PEG) is the preferred way to support nutrition and has been associated with prolonged survival

  
Prognosis  
* poor: 50% of patients die within 3 years
