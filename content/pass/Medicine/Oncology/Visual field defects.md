The main points for the exam are:  
* left homonymous hemianopia means visual field defect to the left, i.e. Lesion of right optic tract
* homonymous quadrantanopias: PITS (Parietal\-Inferior, Temporal\-Superior)
* incongruous defects \= optic tract lesion; congruous defects \= optic radiation lesion or occipital cortex

  
A congruous defect simply means complete or symmetrical visual field loss and conversely an incongruous defect is incomplete or asymmetric. Please see the link for an excellent diagram.  
  
Homonymous hemianopia  
* incongruous defects: lesion of optic tract
* congruous defects: lesion of optic radiation or occipital cortex
* macula sparing: lesion of occipital cortex

  
Homonymous quadrantanopias\*  
* superior: lesion of the inferior optic radiations in the temporal lobe (Meyer's loop)
* inferior: lesion of the superior optic radiations in the parietal lobe
* mnemonic \= PITS (Parietal\-Inferior, Temporal\-Superior)

  
Bitemporal hemianopia  
* lesion of optic chiasm
* upper quadrant defect \> lower quadrant defect \= inferior chiasmal compression, commonly a pituitary tumour
* lower quadrant defect \> upper quadrant defect \= superior chiasmal compression, commonly a craniopharyngioma

  
\*this is very much the 'exam answer'. Actual studies suggest that the majority of quadrantanopias are caused by occipital lobe lesions. Please see the link for more details.
