It should be noted that as a general rule 5\-HT receptor agonists are used in the acute treatment of migraine whilst 5\-HT receptor antagonists are used in prophylaxis. NICE produced guidelines in 2012 on the management of headache, including migraines.  
  
Acute treatment  
* first\-line: offer combination therapy with
	+ an oral triptan and an NSAID, or
	+ an oral triptan and paracetamol
* for young people aged 12\-17 years consider a nasal triptan in preference to an oral triptan
* if the above measures are not effective or not tolerated offer a non\-oral preparation of metoclopramide or prochlorperazine and consider adding a non\-oral NSAID or triptan
	+ caution should be exercised when prescribing metoclopramide to young patients as acute dystonic reactions may develop

  
Prophylaxis  
* prophylaxis should generally be given if '*Migraine attacks are having a significant impact on quality of life and daily function, for example they occur frequently (more than once a week on average) or are prolonged and severe despite optimal acute treatment*'
* NICE CKS advise one of the following:
	+ propranolol
	+ topiramate: should be avoided in women of childbearing age as it may be teratogenic and it can reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives
	+ amitriptyline
* if these measures fail NICE recommends 'a course of up to 10 sessions of acupuncture over 5\-8 weeks'
* NICE recommend: '*Advise people with migraine that riboflavin (400 mg once a day) may be effective in reducing migraine frequency and intensity for some people*'
* for women with predictable menstrual migraine treatment NICE recommend either frovatriptan (2\.5 mg twice a day) or zolmitriptan (2\.5 mg twice or three times a day) as a type of 'mini\-prophylaxis'
* treatment options that may be considered by specialists, but fall outside the NICE guidelines:
	+ candesartan: recommended by the British Association for the Study of Headache guidelines
	+ monoclonal antibodies directed against the calcitonin gene\-related peptide (CGRP) receptor: examples include erenumab
* pizotifen is no longer recommended. Adverse effects such as weight gain \& drowsiness are common
