Lacunar infarcts account for around 20\-25% of ischaemic strokes. They involve occlusion of a single penetrating branch of a large cerebral artery and affect the internal capsule, thalamus and basal ganglia.  
  
Features  
* purely motor
	+ most common lacunar syndrome
* purely sensory
* sensorimotor stroke
* ataxic hemiparesis
	+ ipsilateral weakness and limb ataxia that is out of proportion to the motor deficit
* dysarthria\-clumsy hand syndrome

  
As a general rule, lacunar syndromes typically lack cortical findings such as aphasia, agnosia, neglect, apraxia, or hemianopsia
