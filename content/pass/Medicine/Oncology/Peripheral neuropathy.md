* Guillain\-Barre syndrome
* porphyria
* lead poisoning
* hereditary sensorimotor neuropathies (HSMN) \- Charcot\-Marie\-Tooth
* chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)
* diphtheria

  
Predominately sensory loss  
* diabetes
* uraemia
* leprosy
* alcoholism
* vitamin B12 deficiency
* amyloidosis

  
Alcoholic neuropathy  
* secondary to both direct toxic effects and reduced absorption of B vitamins
* sensory symptoms typically present prior to motor symptoms

  
Vitamin B12 deficiency  
* subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord
* dorsal column usually affected first (joint position, vibration) prior to distal paraesthesia
