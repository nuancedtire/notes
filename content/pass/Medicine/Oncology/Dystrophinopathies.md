Overview  
* X\-linked recessive
* due to mutation in the gene encoding dystrophin, dystrophin gene on Xp21
* dystrophin is part of a large membrane associated protein in muscle which connects the muscle membrane to actin, part of the muscle cytoskeleton
* in Duchenne muscular dystrophy there is a frameshift mutation resulting in one or both of the binding sites are lost leading to a severe form
* in Becker muscular dystrophy there is a non\-frameshift insertion in the dystrophin gene resulting in both binding sites being preserved leading to a milder form

  
Duchenne muscular dystrophy  
* progressive proximal muscle weakness from 5 years
* calf pseudohypertrophy
* Gower's sign: child uses arms to stand up from a squatted position
* 30% of patients have intellectual impairment

  
Becker muscular dystrophy  
* develops after the age of 10 years
* intellectual impairment much less common
