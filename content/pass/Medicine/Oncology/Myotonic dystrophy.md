Myotonic dystrophy (also called dystrophia myotonica) is an inherited myopathy with features developing at around 20\-30 years old. It affects skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle. There are two main types of myotonic dystrophy, DM1 and DM2\.   
  
Genetics  
* autosomal dominant
* a trinucleotide repeat disorder
* DM1 is caused by a CTG repeat at the end of the DMPK (Dystrophia Myotonica\-Protein Kinase) gene on chromosome 19
* DM2 is caused by a repeat expansion of the ZNF9 gene on chromosome 3

  
The key differences are listed in table below:  
  


| **DM1** | **DM2** |
| --- | --- |
| \- DMPK gene on chromosome 19\- Distal weakness more prominent | \- ZNF9 gene on chromosome 3\- Proximal weakness more prominent\- Severe congenital form not seen |

  
General features  
* myotonic facies (long, 'haggard' appearance)
* frontal balding
* bilateral ptosis
* cataracts
* dysarthria

  
Other features  
* myotonia (tonic spasm of muscle)
* weakness of arms and legs (distal initially)
* mild mental impairment
* diabetes mellitus
* testicular atrophy
* cardiac involvement: heart block, cardiomyopathy
* dysphagia
