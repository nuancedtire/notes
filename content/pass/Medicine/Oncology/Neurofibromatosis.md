There are two types of neurofibromatosis, NF1 and NF2\. Both are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion  
  
NF1 is also known as von Recklinghausen's syndrome. It is caused by a gene mutation on chromosome 17 which encodes neurofibromin and affects around 1 in 4,000  
  
NF2 is caused by gene mutation on chromosome 22 and affects around 1 in 100,000

Comparison of neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis. Note that whilst they are both autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorders there is little overlap otherwise
