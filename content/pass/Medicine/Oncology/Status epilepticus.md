Status epilepticus is defined as:  
* a single seizure lasting \>5 minutes, or
* \>\= 2 seizures within a 5\-minute period without the person returning to normal between them

  
This is a medical emergency. The priority is the termination of seizure activity, which if prolonged will lead to irreversible brain damage.   
  
Management  
* ABC
	+ airway adjunct
	+ oxygen
	+ check blood glucose
* First\-line drugs are benzodiazepines
	+ in the prehospital setting PR diazepam or buccal midazolam may be given
	+ in hospital IV lorazepam is generally used. This may be repeated once after 5\-10minutes
* If ongoing (or 'established') status it is appropriate to start a second\-line agent such as levetiracetam, phenytoin or sodium valproate
	+ NICE state 'Take into account that levetiracetam may be quicker to administer and have fewer adverse effects than the alternative options.'
* If no response ('refractory status') within 45 minutes from onset, then the best way to achieve rapid control of seizure activity is induction of general anaesthesia or phenobarbital
