As the brain and ventricles are enclosed by a rigid skull, they have a limited ability to accommodate additional volume. Additional volume (e.g. haematoma, tumour, excessive CSF) will therefore lead to a rise in intracranial pressure (ICP).  
  
Pathophysiology  
* the normal ICP is 7\-15 mmHg in adults in the supine position
* cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is the net pressure gradient causing cerebral blood flow to the brain
* CPP \= mean arterial pressure \- ICP

  
Causes  
* idiopathic intracranial hypertension
* traumatic head injuries
* infection
	+ meningitis
* tumours
* hydrocephalus

  
Features  
* headache
* vomiting
* reduced levels of consciousness
* papilloedema
* Cushing's triad
	+ widening pulse pressure
	+ bradycardia
	+ irregular breathing

  
Investigations and monitoring  
* neuroimaging (CT/MRI) is key to investigate the underlying cause
* invasive ICP monitoring
	+ catheter placed into the lateral ventricles of the brain to monitor the pressure
	+ may also be used to take collect CSF samples and also to drain small amounts of CSF to reduce the pressure
	+ a cut\-off of \> 20 mmHg is often used to determine if further treatment is needed to reduce the ICP

  
Management  
* investigate and treat the underlying cause
* head elevation to 30º
* IV mannitol may be used as an osmotic diuretic
* controlled hyperventilation
	+ aim is to reduce pCO2 → vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries → reduced ICP
	+ leads to rapid, temporary lowering of ICP. However, caution needed as may reduce blood flow to already ischaemic parts of the brain
* removal of CSF, different techniques include:
	+ drain from intraventricular monitor (see above)
	+ repeated lumbar puncture (e.g. idiopathic intracranial hypertension)
	+ ventriculoperitoneal shunt (for hydrocephalus)
