Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord is due to vitamin B12 deficiency resulting in impairment of the dorsal columns, lateral corticospinal tracts and spinocerebellar tracts..  
  
Recreational nitrous oxide inhalation may also result in vitamin B12 deficiency → subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.  
  
Features  
* dorsal column involvement
	+ distal tingling/burning/sensory loss is symmetrical and tends to affect the legs more than the arms
	+ impaired proprioception and vibration sense
* lateral corticospinal tract involvement
	+ muscle weakness, hyperreflexia, and spasticity
	+ upper motor neuron signs typically develop in the legs first
	+ brisk knee reflexes
	+ absent ankle jerks
	+ extensor plantars
* spinocerebellar tract involvement
	+ sensory ataxia → gait abnormalities
	+ positive Romberg's sign
