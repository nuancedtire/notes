Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is a genetic condition of autosomal dominant inheritance. Like neurofibromatosis, the majority of features seen in TS are neurocutaneous.  
  
Cutaneous features  
* depigmented 'ash\-leaf' spots which fluoresce under UV light
* roughened patches of skin over lumbar spine (Shagreen patches)
* adenoma sebaceum (angiofibromas): butterfly distribution over nose
* fibromata beneath nails (subungual fibromata)
* cafe\-au\-lait spots\* may be seen

  
Neurological features  
* developmental delay
* epilepsy (infantile spasms or partial)
* intellectual impairment

  
Also  
* retinal hamartomas: dense white areas on retina (phakomata)
* rhabdomyomas of the heart
* gliomatous changes can occur in the brain lesions
* polycystic kidneys, renal angiomyolipomata
* lymphangioleiomyomatosis: multiple lung cysts

Comparison of neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis. Note that whilst they are both autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorders there is little overlap otherwise  
  
\*these of course are more commonly associated with neurofibromatosis. However a 1998 study of 106 children with TS found cafe\-au\-lait spots in 28% of patients
