Whilst the diagnosis of stroke may sometimes be obvious in many cases the presenting symptoms may be vague and accurate assessment difficult.  
  
The FAST screening tool (Face/Arms/Speech/Time) is widely known by the general public following a publicity campaign. It has a positive predictive value of 78%.  
  
A variant of FAST called the ROSIER score is useful for medical professionals. It is validated tool recommended by the Royal College of Physicians.  
  
ROSIER score
------------

  
Exclude hypoglycaemia first, then assess the following:  
  


| **Assessment** | **Scoring** |
| --- | --- |
| Loss of consciousness or syncope | \- 1 point |
| Seizure activity | \- 1 point |
| New, acute onset of: |  |
| • asymmetric facial weakness | \+ 1 point |
| • asymmetric arm weakness | \+ 1 point |
| • asymmetric leg weakness | \+ 1 point |
| • speech disturbance | \+ 1 point |
| • visual field defect | \+ 1 point |

  
A stroke is likely if \> 0\.  
  
Investigations
--------------

  
A non\-contrast CT head scan is the first line radiological investigation for suspected stroke  
* one of the key questions to answer is whether there is an ischaemic stroke or haemorrhagic stroke. Rarely a third pathology such as a tumour may also be detected
* this is especially important given the increasing role of thrombolysis and thrombectomy in acute stroke management
* acute ischaemic strokes
	+ may show areas of low density in the grey and white matter of the territory. These changes may take time to develop
	+ other signs include the 'hyperdense artery' sign corresponding with the responsible arterial clot \- this tends to visible immediately
* acute haemorrhagic strokes
	+ typically show areas of hyperdense material (blood) surrounded by low density (oedema)
