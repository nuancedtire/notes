Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (also known as pseudotumour cerebri and formerly benign intracranial hypertension) is a condition classically seen in young, overweight females.  
  
Risk factors  
* obesity
* female sex
* pregnancy
* drugs
	+ combined oral contraceptive pill
	+ steroids
	+ tetracyclines
	+ retinoids (isotretinoin, tretinoin) / vitamin A
	+ lithium

  
Features  
* headache
* blurred vision
* papilloedema (usually present)
* enlarged blind spot
* sixth nerve palsy may be present

  
Management  
* weight loss
	+ whilst diet and exercise are important, medications such as semaglitide and topiramate may be considered by specialists. Topiramate is particularly beneficial as it also inhibits carbonic anhydrase
* carbonic anhydrase inhibitors e.g. acetazolamide
* topiramate is also used, and has the added benefit of causing weight loss in most patients
* repeated lumbar puncture may be used as a temporary measure but is not suitable for longer\-term management
* surgery: optic nerve sheath decompression and fenestration may be needed to prevent damage to the optic nerve. A lumboperitoneal or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may also be performed to reduce intracranial pressure
