Treatment in multiple sclerosis is focused on reducing the frequency and duration of relapses. There is no cure.   
  
Acute relapse
-------------

  
 High\-dose steroids (e.g. oral or IV methylprednisolone) may be given for 5 days to shorten the length of an acute relapse. It should be noted that steroids shorten the duration of a relapse and do not alter the degree of recovery (i.e. whether a patient returns to baseline function)  
  
Disease modifying drugs
-----------------------

  
A number of drugs have been shown to reduce the risk of relapse in patients with MS. Typical indications for disease\-modifying drugs include:  
* relapsing\-remitting disease \+ 2 relapses in past 2 years \+ able to walk 100m unaided
* secondary progressive disease \+ 2 relapses in past 2 years \+ able to walk 10m (aided or unaided)

  
Drug options for reducing the risk of relapse in MS  
* natalizumab
	+ a recombinant monoclonal antibody that antagonises alpha\-4 beta\-1\-integrin found on the surface of leucocytes
	+ inhibit migration of leucocytes across the endothelium across the blood\-brain barrier
	+ generally considered to have the strongest evidence base for preventing relapse of the disease\-modifying and hence is often used first\-line
	+ given intravenously
* ocrelizumab
	+ humanized anti\-CD20 monoclonal antibody
	+ like natalizumab, it is considered a high\-efficacy drug that is often used first\-line
	+ given intravenously
* fingolimod
	+ sphingosine 1\-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator
	+ prevents lymphocytes from leaving lymph nodes
	+ oral formulations are available
* beta\-interferon
	+ not considered to be as effective as alternative disease\-modifying drugs
	+ given subcutaneously/intramuscularly
* glatiramer acetate
	+ immunomodulating drug \- acts as an 'immune decoy'
	+ given subcutaneously
	+ along with beta\-interferon considered an 'older drug' with less effectiveness compared to monoclonal antibodies and S1P) receptor modulators

  
  
Some specific problems
----------------------

  
Fatigue  
* once other problems (e.g. anaemia, thyroid or depression) have been excluded NICE recommend a trial of amantadine
* other options include mindfulness training and CBT

  
Spasticity  
* baclofen and gabapentin are first\-line. Other options include diazepam, dantrolene and tizanidine
* physiotherapy is important
* cannabis and botox are undergoing evaluation

  
Bladder dysfunction  
* may take the form of urgency, incontinence, overflow etc
* guidelines stress the importance of getting an ultrasound first to assess bladder emptying \- anticholinergics may worsen symptoms in some patients
* if significant residual volume → intermittent self\-catheterisation
* if no significant residual volume → anticholinergics may improve urinary frequency

  
Oscillopsia (visual fields appear to oscillate)  
* gabapentin is first\-line
