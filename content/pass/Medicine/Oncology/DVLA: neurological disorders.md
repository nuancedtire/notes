The guidelines below relate to car/motorcycle use unless specifically stated. For obvious reasons, the rules relating to drivers of heavy goods vehicles tend to be much stricter  
  
Epilepsy/seizures \- all patient must not drive and must inform the DVLA  
* first unprovoked/isolated seizure: 6 months off if there are no relevant structural abnormalities on brain imaging and no definite epileptiform activity on EEG. If these conditions are not met then this is increased to 12 months
* for patients with established epilepsy or those with multiple unprovoked seizures:
	+ may qualify for a driving licence if they have been free from any seizure for 12 months
	+ if there have been no seizures for 5 years (with medication if necessary) a 'til 70 licence is usually restored
* withdrawawl of epilepsy medication: should not drive whilst anti\-epilepsy medication is being withdrawn and for 6 months after the last dose

  
Syncope  
* simple faint: no restriction
* single episode, explained and treated: 4 weeks off
* single episode, unexplained: 6 months off
* two or more episodes: 12 months off

  
Other conditions  
* stroke or TIA: 1 month off driving, may not need to inform DVLA if no residual neurological deficit
* multiple TIAs over short period of times: 3 months off driving and inform DVLA
* craniotomy e.g. For meningioma: 1 year off driving\*
* pituitary tumour: craniotomy: 6 months; trans\-sphenoidal surgery 'can drive when there is no debarring residual impairment likely to affect safe driving'
* narcolepsy/cataplexy: cease driving on diagnosis, can restart once 'satisfactory control of symptoms'
* chronic neurological disorders e.g. multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease: DVLA should be informed, complete PK1 form (application for driving licence holders state of health)

  
  
\*if the tumour is a benign meningioma and there is no seizure history, licence can be reconsidered 6 months after surgery if remains seizure free
