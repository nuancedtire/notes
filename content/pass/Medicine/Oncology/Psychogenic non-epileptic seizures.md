Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are sometimes referred to as pseudoseizures.  
  
Factors favouring pseudoseizures  
* pelvic thrusting
* family member with epilepsy
* much more common in females
* crying after seizure
* don't occur when alone
* gradual onset

  
Factors favouring true epileptic seizures  
* tongue biting
* raised serum prolactin\*

  
Video telemetry is useful for differentiating  
  
\*why prolactin is raised following seizures is not fully understood. It is hypothesised that there is spread of electrical activity to the ventromedial hypothalamus, leading to release of a specific prolactin regulator into the hypophyseal portal system
