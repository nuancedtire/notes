Some of the more commonly occurring genetic conditions occurring in surgical patients are presented here.  
  
**Li\-Fraumeni Syndrome**  
* Autosomal dominant
* Consists of germline mutations to p53 tumour suppressor gene
* High incidence of malignancies particularly sarcomas and leukaemias
* Diagnosed when:

  
\*Individual develops sarcoma under 45 years  
\*First degree relative diagnosed with any cancer below age 45 years and another family member develops malignancy under 45 years or sarcoma at any age  
  
**BRCA 1 and 2**  
* Carried on chromosome 17 (BRCA 1\) and Chromosome 13 (BRCA 2\)
* Linked to developing breast cancer (60%) risk.
* Associated risk of developing ovarian cancer (55% with BRCA 1 and 25% with BRCA 2\).
* BRCA2 mutation is associated with prostate cancer in men

  
**Lynch Syndrome**  
* Autosomal dominant
* Develop colonic cancer and endometrial cancer at young age
* 80% of affected individuals will get colonic and/ or endometrial cancer
* High risk individuals may be identified using the Amsterdam criteria

  
**Amsterdam criteria**  
Three or more family members with a confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer, one of whom is a first degree (parent, child, sibling) relative of the other two.  
Two successive affected generations.  
One or more colon cancers diagnosed under age 50 years.  
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) has been excluded.  
  
**Gardners syndrome**  
* Autosomal dominant familial colorectal polyposis
* Multiple colonic polyps
* Extra colonic diseases include: skull osteoma, thyroid cancer and epidermoid cysts
* Desmoid tumours are seen in 15%
* Mutation of APC gene located on chromosome 5
* Due to colonic polyps most patients will undergo colectomy to reduce risk of colorectal cancer
* Now considered a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis coli
