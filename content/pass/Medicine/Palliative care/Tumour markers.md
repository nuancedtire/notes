Tumour markers may be divided into:  
* monoclonal antibodies against carbohydrate or glycoprotein tumour antigens
* tumour antigens
* enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, neurone specific enolase)
* hormones (e.g. calcitonin, ADH)

  
It should be noted that tumour markers usually have a low specificity
