The tables below summarises the mechanism of action and major adverse effects of commonly used cytotoxic agents.  
  
Alkylating agents
-----------------

  


| **Cytotoxic** | **Mechanism of action** | **Adverse effects** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cyclophosphamide | Alkylating agent \- causes cross\-linking in DNA | Haemorrhagic cystitis, myelosuppression, transitional cell carcinoma |

  
Cytotoxic antibiotics
---------------------

  


| **Cytotoxic** | **Mechanism of action** | **Adverse effects** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bleomycin | Degrades preformed DNA | Lung fibrosis |
| Anthracyclines (e.g doxorubicin) | Stabilizes DNA\-topoisomerase II complex inhibits DNA \& RNA synthesis | Cardiomyopathy |

  
Antimetabolites
---------------

  


| **Cytotoxic** | **Mechanism of action** | **Adverse effects** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Methotrexate | Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthesis | Myelosuppression, mucositis, liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis |
| Fluorouracil (5\-FU) | Pyrimidine analogue inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by blocking thymidylate synthase (works during S phase) | Myelosuppression, mucositis, dermatitis |
| 6\-mercaptopurine | Purine analogue that is activated by HGPRTase, decreasing purine synthesis | Myelosuppression |
| Cytarabine | Pyrimidine antagonist. Interferes with DNA synthesis specifically at the S\-phase of the cell cycle and inhibits DNA polymerase | Myelosuppression, ataxia |

  
Acts on microtubules
--------------------

  


| **Cytotoxic** | **Mechanism of action** | **Adverse effects** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vincristine, vinblastine | Inhibits formation of microtubules | Vincristine: Peripheral neuropathy (reversible) , paralytic ileusVinblastine: myelosuppression |
| Docetaxel | Prevents microtubule depolymerisation \& disassembly, decreasing free tubulin | Neutropaenia |

  
Topoisomerase Inhibitors
------------------------

  


| **Cytotoxic** | **Mechanism of action** | **Adverse effects** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Irinotecan | Inhibits topoisomerase I which prevents relaxation of supercoiled DNA | Myelosuppression |

  
Other cytotoxic drugs
---------------------

  


| **Cytotoxic** | **Mechanism of action** | **Adverse effects** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cisplatin | Causes cross\-linking in DNA | Ototoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, hypomagnesaemia |
| Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) | Inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, decreasing DNA synthesis | Myelosuppression |
