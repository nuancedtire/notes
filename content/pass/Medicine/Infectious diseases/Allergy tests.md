Can be interpreted after 15 minutesUseful for food allergies and also pollen |
| **Radioallergosorbent test (RAST)** | Determines the amount of IgE that reacts specifically with suspected or known allergens, for example IgE to egg protein. Results are given in grades from 0 (negative) to 6 (strongly positive)Useful for food allergies, inhaled allergens (e.g. Pollen) and wasp/bee venomBlood tests may be used when skin prick tests are not suitable, for example if there is extensive eczema or if the patient is taking antihistamines |
| **Skin patch testing** | Useful for contact dermatitis. Around 30\-40 allergens are placed on the back. Irritants may also be tested for. The patches are removed 48 hours later with the results being read by a dermatologist after a further 48 hours |
