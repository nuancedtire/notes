Primary biliary cholangitis (previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis) is a chronic liver disorder typically seen in middle\-aged females (female:male ratio of 9:1\). The aetiology is not fully understood although it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. Interlobular bile ducts become damaged by a chronic inflammatory process causing progressive cholestasis which may eventually progress to cirrhosis. The classic presentation is itching in a middle\-aged woman  
  
Associations  
* Sjogren's syndrome (seen in up to 80% of patients)
* rheumatoid arthritis
* systemic sclerosis
* thyroid disease

  
Clinical features  
* early: may be asymptomatic (e.g. raised ALP on routine LFTs) or fatigue, pruritus
* cholestatic jaundice
* hyperpigmentation, especially over pressure points
* around 10% of patients have right upper quadrant pain
* xanthelasmas, xanthomata
* also: clubbing, hepatosplenomegaly
* late: may progress to liver failure

  
Diagnosis  
* immunology
	+ anti\-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) M2 subtype are present in 98% of patients and are highly specific
	+ smooth muscle antibodies in 30% of patients
	+ raised serum IgM
* imaging
	+ required before diagnosis to exclude an extrahepatic biliary obstruction (typically a right upper quadrant ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)

  
Management  
* first\-line: ursodeoxycholic acid
	+ slows disease progression and improves symptoms
* pruritus: cholestyramine
* fat\-soluble vitamin supplementation
* liver transplantation
	+ e.g. if bilirubin \> 100 (PBC is a major indication)
	+ recurrence in graft can occur but is not usually a problem

  
Complications  
* cirrhosis → portal hypertension → ascites, variceal haemorrhage
* osteomalacia and osteoporosis
* significantly increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (20\-fold increased risk)
