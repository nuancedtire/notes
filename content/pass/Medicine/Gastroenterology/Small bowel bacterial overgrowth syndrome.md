Small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome (SBBOS) is a disorder characterised by excessive amounts of bacteria in the small bowel resulting in gastrointestinal symptoms.  
  
Risk factors for SBBOS  
* neonates with congenital gastrointestinal abnormalities
* scleroderma
* diabetes mellitus

  
It should be noted that many of the features overlap with irritable bowel syndrome:  
* chronic diarrhoea
* bloating, flatulence
* abdominal pain

   
Diagnosis  
* hydrogen breath test
* small bowel aspiration and culture: this is used less often as invasive and results are often difficult to reproduce
* clinicians may sometimes give a course of antibiotics as a diagnostic trial

  
Management  
* correction of the underlying disorder
* antibiotic therapy:rifaximin is now the treatment of choice due to relatively low resistance. Co\-amoxiclav or metronidazole are also effective in the majority of patients.
