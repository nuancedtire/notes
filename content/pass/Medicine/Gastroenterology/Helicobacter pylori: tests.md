Urea breath test  
* patients consume a drink containing carbon isotope 13 (13C) enriched urea
* urea is broken down by *H. pylori* urease
* after 30 mins patient exhale into a glass tube
* mass spectrometry analysis calculates the amount of 13C CO2
* should not be performed within 4 weeks of treatment with an antibacterial or within 2 weeks of an antisecretory drug (e.g. a proton pump inhibitor)
* sensitivity 95\-98%, specificity 97\-98%
* may be used to check for *H. pylori* eradication

  
Rapid urease test (e.g. CLO test)  
* biopsy sample is mixed with urea and pH indicator
* colour change if H pylori urease activity
* sensitivity 90\-95%, specificity 95\-98%

  
Serum antibody  
* remains positive after eradication
* sensitivity 85%, specificity 80%

  
Culture of gastric biopsy  
* provide information on antibiotic sensitivity
* sensitivity 70%, specificity 100%

  
Gastric biopsy  
* histological evaluation alone, no culture
* sensitivity 95\-99%, specificity 95\-99%

  
Stool antigen test  
* sensitivity 90%, specificity 95%
