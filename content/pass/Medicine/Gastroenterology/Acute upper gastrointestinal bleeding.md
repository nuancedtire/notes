Acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a common and important presentation. It may be caused by a wide variety of conditions but is most commonly due to either oesophageal varices or peptic ulcer disease.  
  
Clinical features  
* haematemesis
	+ the most common presenting feature
	+ often bright red but may sometimes be described as 'coffee ground'
* melena
	+ the passage of altered blood per rectum
	+ typically black and 'tarry'
* a raised urea may be seen due to the 'protein meal' of the blood
* features associated with a particular diagnosis e,g,
	+ oesophageal varices: stigmata of chronic liver disease
	+ peptic ulcer disease: abdominal pain

  
  
Differential diagnosis
----------------------

  
### Oesophageal causes

  


| **Cause** | **Presenting features** |
| --- | --- |
| Oesophageal varices | Usually a large volume of fresh blood. Swallowed blood may cause melena. Often associated with haemodynamic compromise. May stop spontaneously but re\-bleeds are common until appropriately managed. |
| Oesophagitis | Small volume of fresh blood, often streaking vomit. Melena rare. Often ceases spontaneously. Usually history of antecedent GORD\-type symptoms. |
| Cancer | Usually small volume of blood, except as a preterminal event with erosion of major vessels. Often associated symptoms of dysphagia and constitutional symptoms such as weight loss. May be recurrent until malignancy is managed. |
| Mallory Weiss tear | Typically brisk small to moderate volume of bright red blood following a bout of repeated vomiting. Melena is rare. Usually ceases spontaneously. |

  
### Gastric causes

  


| **Cause** | **Presenting features** |
| --- | --- |
| Gastric ulcer | Small low low\-volume bleeds are more common so would tend to present as iron deficiency anaemia. Erosion into a significant vessel may produce considerable haemorrhage and haematemesis. |
| Gastric cancer | May be frank haematemesis or altered blood mixed with vomit. Usually prodromal features of dyspepsia and may have constitutional symptoms. Amount of bleeding variable but erosion of major vessel may produce considerable haemorrhage. |
| Dieulafoy lesion | Often no prodromal features prior to haematemesis and melena, but this arteriovenous malformation may produce quite a considerable haemorrhage and may be difficult to detect endoscopically |
| Diffuse erosive gastritis | Usually haematemesis and epigastric discomfort. Usually, there is an underlying cause such as recent NSAID usage. Large volume haemorrhage may occur with considerable haemodynamic compromise |

  
### Duodenual causes

  


| **Cause** | **Presenting features** |
| --- | --- |
| Duodenal ulcer | These are usually posteriorly sited and may erode the gastroduodenal artery. However, ulcers at any site in the duodenum may present with haematemesis, melena and epigastric discomfort. The pain of a duodenal ulcer is slightly different to that of gastric ulcers and often occurs several hours after eating. Periampullary tumours may bleed but these are rare. |
| Aorto\-enteric fistula | In patients with previous abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery aorto\-enteric fistulation remains a rare but important cause of major haemorrhage associated with high mortality. |

  
  
Management
----------

  
NICE published guidelines in 2012 on the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding which is most commonly due to either peptic ulcer disease or oesophageal varices. Some of the key points are detailed below.  
  
Risk assessment  
* the Glasgow\-Blatchford score at first assessment
	+ helps clinicians decide whether patients can be managed as outpatients or not
* the Rockall score is used *after* endoscopy
	+ provides a percentage risk of rebleeding and mortality
	+ includes age, features of shock, co\-morbidities, aetiology of bleeding and endoscopic stigmata of recent haemorrhage

  
### Blatchford score

  


| **Admission risk marker** | **Score** |
| --- | --- |
| Urea (mmol/L)(High urea levels in upper GI bleeds are due to the 'protein meal' of blood) | 6Â·5 \- 8 \= 28 \- 10 \= 310 \- 25 \= 4\> 25 \= 6 |
| Haemoglobin (g/L) | Men* 12 \- 13 \= 1 * 10 \- 12 \= 3 * \< 10 \= 6  Women* 10 \- 12 \= 1 * \< 10 \= 6 |
| Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) | 100 \- 109 \= 190 \- 99 \= 2\< 90 \= 3 |
| Other markers | Pulse \>\=100/min \= 1Presentation with melaena \= 1Presentation with syncope \= 2Hepatic disease \= 2Cardiac failure \= 2 |

  
Patients with a Blatchford score of 0 may be considered for early discharge.  
  
Resuscitation  
* ABC, wide\-bore intravenous access \* 2
* platelet transfusion if actively bleeding platelet count of less than 50 x 10\*9/litre
* fresh frozen plasma to patients who have either a fibrinogen level of less than 1 g/litre, or a prothrombin time (international normalised ratio) or activated partial thromboplastin time greater than 1\.5 times normal
* prothrombin complex concentrate to patients who are taking warfarin and actively bleeding

  
Endoscopy  
* should be offered immediately after resuscitation in patients with a severe bleed
* all patients should have endoscopy within 24 hours

  
Management of non\-variceal bleeding  
* NICE do not recommend the use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) before endoscopy to patients with suspected variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding although PPIs should be given to patients with non\-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding and stigmata of recent haemorrhage shown at endoscopy
* if further bleeding then options include repeat endoscopy, interventional radiology and surgery

  
Management of variceal bleeding  
* terlipressin and prophylactic antibiotics should be given to patients at presentation (i.e. before endoscopy)
* band ligation should be used for oesophageal varices and injections of N\-butyl\-2\-cyanoacrylate for patients with gastric varices
* transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) should be offered if bleeding from varices is not controlled with the above measures
