### Investigations

Routine investigations are not normally required unless the patient is unwell.

Stool culture

* in a primary care setting, NICE recommend a stool sample in the following scenarios:
  * the patient is systemically unwell and needs hospital admission, +/- antibiotics
  * blood or pus in the stool
  * immunocompromised
  * recently received antibiotics, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or been in hospital
  * recent foreign travel
  * public health indication: diarrhoea in high-risk people (for example food handlers, healthcare workers, elderly residents in care homes), suspected food poisoning (for example after a barbeque, restaurant meal, or eating eggs, chicken, or shellfish)

Bloods

* bloods are not routinely indicated
* however, if severe, these may show
  * acute kidney injury
  * hypokalaemia
  * hyponatraemia
