Carcinoid syndrome  
* usually occurs when metastases are present in the liver and release serotonin into the systemic circulation
* may also occur with lung carcinoid as mediators are not 'cleared' by the liver

  
Features   
* flushing (often the earliest symptom)
* diarrhoea
* bronchospasm
* hypotension
* right heart valvular stenosis (left heart can be affected in bronchial carcinoid)
* other molecules such as ACTH and GHRH may also be secreted resulting in, for example, Cushing's syndrome
* pellagra can rarely develop as dietary tryptophan is diverted to serotonin by the tumour

  
Investigation  
* urinary 5\-HIAA
* plasma chromogranin A y

  
Management  
* somatostatin analogues e.g. octreotide
* diarrhoea: cyproheptadine may help
