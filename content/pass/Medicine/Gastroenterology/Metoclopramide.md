Metoclopramide is a D2 receptor antagonist\* mainly used in the management of nausea. Other uses include:  
* gastro\-oesophageal reflux disease
* prokinetic action is useful in gastroparesis secondary to diabetic neuropathy
* often combined with analgesics for the treatment of migraine (migraine attacks result in gastroparesis, slowing the absorption of analgesics)

  
Adverse effects  
* extrapyramidal effects
	+ acute dystonia e.g. oculogyric crisis
	+ this is particularly a problem in children and young adults
* diarrhoea
* hyperprolactinaemia
* tardive dyskinesia
* parkinsonism

  
Metoclopramide should be avoided in bowel obstruction, but may be helpful in paralytic ileus.  
  
  
\*whilst metoclopramide is primarily a D2 receptor antagonist, the mechanism of action is quite complicated:  
* it is also a mixed 5\-HT3 receptor antagonist/5\-HT4 receptor agonist
* the antiemetic action is due to its antagonist activity at D2 receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. At higher doses the 5\-HT3 receptor antagonist also has an effect
* the gastroprokinetic activity is mediated by D2 receptor antagonist activity and 5\-HT4 receptor agonist activity
