The 2015 NICE guidelines 'Suspected cancer: recognition and referral' further updated the advice on who needs urgent referral for an endoscopy (i.e. within 2 weeks). The list below combines the advice for oesophageal and stomach cancer, with the bold added by the author, not NICE.  
  
Urgent
------

  
All patients who've got **dysphagia**  
  
All patients who've got an **upper abdominal mass** consistent with stomach cancer  
  
Patients aged \>\= 55 years who've got **weight loss**, AND any of the following:  
* upper abdominal pain
* reflux
* dyspepsia

  
Non\-urgent
-----------

  
Patients with **haematemesis**  
  
Patients aged \>\= 55 years who've got:  
* **treatment\-resistant dyspepsia** or
* upper abdominal pain with low haemoglobin levels or
* **raised platelet count** with any of the following: nausea, vomiting, weight loss, reflux, dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain
* nausea or vomiting with any of the following: weight loss, reflux, dyspepsia, upper abdominal pain

  
  
Managing patients who do not meet referral criteria ('undiagnosed dyspepsia')
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
This can be summarised at a step\-wise approach  
* 1\. Review medications for possible causes of dyspepsia
* 2\. Lifestyle advice
* 3\. Trial of full\-dose proton pump inhibitor for one month OR a 'test and treat' approach for *H. pylori*
	+ if symptoms persist after either of the above approaches then the alternative approach should be tried

  
Testing for *H. pylori* infection  
* initial diagnosis: NICE recommend using a carbon\-13 urea breath test or a stool antigen test, or laboratory\-based serology 'where its performance has been locally validated'
* test of cure:
	+ there is no need to check for *H. pylori* eradication if symptoms have resolved following test and treat
	+ however, if repeat testing is required then a carbon\-13 urea breath test should be used
