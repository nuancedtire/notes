5\-aminosalicyclic acid (5\-ASA) is released in the colon and is not absorbed. It acts locally as an anti\-inflammatory. The mechanism of action is not fully understood but 5\-ASA may inhibit prostaglandin synthesis  
  
Sulphasalazine  
* a combination of sulphapyridine (a sulphonamide) and 5\-ASA
* many side\-effects are due to the sulphapyridine moiety: rashes, oligospermia, headache, Heinz body anaemia, megaloblastic anaemia, lung fibrosis
* other side\-effects are common to 5\-ASA drugs (see mesalazine)

  
Mesalazine  
* a delayed release form of 5\-ASA
* sulphapyridine side\-effects seen in patients taking sulphasalazine are avoided
* mesalazine is still however associated with side\-effects such as GI upset, headache, agranulocytosis, pancreatitis\*, interstitial nephritis

  
Olsalazine  
* two molecules of 5\-ASA linked by a diazo bond, which is broken by colonic bacteria

  
Aminosalicylates are associated with a variety of haematological adverse effects, including agranulocytosis \- FBC is a key investigation in an unwell patient taking them.  
  
\*pancreatitis is 7 times more common in patients taking mesalazine than sulfasalazine
