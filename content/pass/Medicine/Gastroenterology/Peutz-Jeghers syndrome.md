Peutz\-Jeghers syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition characterised by numerous hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. It is also associated with pigmented freckles on the lips, face, palms and soles. Although the polyps themselves don't have malignant potential, around 50% of patients will have died from another gastrointestinal tract cancer by the age of 60 years.
