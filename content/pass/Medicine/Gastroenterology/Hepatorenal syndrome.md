The management of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is notoriously difficult. The ideal treatment is liver transplantation but patients are often too unwell to have surgery and there is a shortage of donors  
  
The most accepted theory regarding the pathophysiology of HRS is that vasoactive mediators cause **splanchnic vasodilation** which in turn reduces the systemic vascular resistance. This results in 'underfilling' of the kidneys. This is sensed by the juxtaglomerular apparatus which then activates the renin\-angiotensin\-aldosterone system, causing renal vasoconstriction which is not enough to counterbalance the effects of the splanchnic vasodilation.  
  
Hepatorenal syndrome has been categorized into two types:  
  


| **Type 1 HRS** | **Type 2 HRS** |
| --- | --- |
| Rapidly progressive Doubling of serum creatinine to \> 221 Âµmol/L or a halving of the creatinine clearance to less than 20 ml/min over a period of less than 2 weeks Very poor prognosis | Slowly progressive Prognosis poor, but patients may live for longer |

  
Management options  
* vasopressin analogues, for example terlipressin, have a growing evidence base supporting their use. They work by causing vasoconstriction of the splanchnic circulation
* volume expansion with 20% albumin
* transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
