Gastric cancer accounts for around 2% of all cancer diagnoses in the developed world, making it much less common than colorectal and slightly less common than oesophageal cancer. It is a cancer of older people (half of patients are \> 75 years) and has a male predominance (2:1\).   
  
Gastric adenocarcinoma, the most prevalent type of gastric cancer, arises from the glandular epithelium of the stomach lining.   
  
Risk factors  
* *Helicobacer pylori*
	+ triggers inflammation of the mucosa → atrophy and intestinal metaplasia → dysplasia
* pernicious anaemia, atrophic gastritis
* diet
	+ salt and salt\-preserved foods
	+ nitrates
* ethnicity: Japan, China
* smoking
* blood group A

  
Features  
* abdominal pain
	+ typically vague, epigastric pain
	+ may present as dyspepsia
* weight loss and anorexia
* nausea and vomiting
* dysphagia: particularly if the cancer arises in the proximal stomach
* overt upper gastrointestinal bleeding is seen only in a minority of patients
* if lymphatic spread:
	+ left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow's node)
	+ periumbilical nodule (Sister Mary Joseph's node)

  
Investigations  
* diagnosis: oesophago\-gastro\-duodenoscopy with biopsy
	+ signet ring cells may be seen in gastric cancer. They contain a large vacuole of mucin which displaces the nucleus to one side. Higher numbers of signet ring cells are associated with a worse prognosis
* staging:
	+ CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is indicated in all patients to look for metastatic disease
	+ other modalities they may be used for staging include endoscopic ultrasound, (FDG)\-PET scanning and pre\-operative staging laparoscopy

  
Management  
* surgical options depend on the extent and site but include:
	+ endoscopic mucosal resection
	+ partial gastrectomy
	+ total gastrectomy
* chemotherapy
