Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed late as it tends to present in a non\-specific way. Over 80% of pancreatic tumours are adenocarcinomas which typically occur at the head of the pancreas.  
  
Associations  
* increasing age
* smoking
* diabetes
* chronic pancreatitis (alcohol does not appear an independent risk factor though)
* hereditary non\-polyposis colorectal carcinoma
* multiple endocrine neoplasia
* BRCA2 gene
* KRAS gene mutation

  
Features  
* classically painless jaundice
	+ pale stools, dark urine, and pruritus
	+ cholestatic liver function tests
* the following abdominal masses may be found (in decreasing order of frequency)
	+ hepatomegaly: due to metastases
	+ gallbladder: Courvoisier's law states that in the presence of painless obstructive jaundice, a palpable gallbladder is unlikely to be due to gallstones
	+ epigastric mass: from the primary tumour
* many patients present in a non\-specific way with anorexia, weight loss, epigastric pain
* loss of exocrine function (e.g. steatorrhoea)
* loss of endocrine function (e.g. diabetes mellitus)
* atypical back pain is often seen
* migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau sign) is more common than with other cancers

  
Investigation  
* ultrasound has a sensitivity of around 60\-90%
* high\-resolution CT scanning is the investigation of choice if the diagnosis is suspected
* imaging may demonstrate the 'double duct' sign \- the presence of simultaneous dilatation of the common bile and pancreatic ducts

  
Management  
* less than 20% are suitable for surgery at diagnosis
* a Whipple's resection (pancreaticoduodenectomy) is performed for resectable lesions in the head of pancreas. Side\-effects of a Whipple's include dumping syndrome and peptic ulcer disease
* adjuvant chemotherapy is usually given following surgery
* ERCP with stenting is often used for palliation
