Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B is the most common cause of HCC worldwide with chronic hepatitis C being the most common cause in Europe.  
  
The main risk factor for developing HCC is liver cirrhosis, for example secondary\* to hepatitis B \& C, alcohol, haemochromatosis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Other risk factors include:  
* alpha\-1 antitrypsin deficiency
* hereditary tyrosinosis
* glycogen storage disease
* aflatoxin
* drugs: oral contraceptive pill, anabolic steroids
* porphyria cutanea tarda
* male sex
* diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome

  
Features  
* tends to present late
* features of liver cirrhosis or failure may be seen: jaundice, ascites, RUQ pain, hepatomegaly, pruritus, splenomegaly
* possible presentation is decompensation in a patient with chronic liver disease
* raised AFP

  
Screening with ultrasound (\+/\- alpha\-fetoprotein) should be considered for high risk groups such as:  
* patients liver cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis B \& C or haemochromatosis
* men with liver cirrhosis secondary to alcohol

  
Management options  
* early disease: surgical resection
* liver transplantation
* radiofrequency ablation
* transarterial chemoembolisation
* sorafenib: a multikinase inhibitor
