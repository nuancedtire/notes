Non\-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the most common cause of liver disease in the developed world. It is largely caused by obesity and describes a spectrum of disease ranging from:  
* steatosis \- fat in the liver
* steatohepatitis \- fat with inflammation, non\-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), see below
* progressive disease may cause fibrosis and liver cirrhosis

  
NAFLD is thought to represent the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and hence insulin resistance is thought to be the key mechanism leading to steatosis.  
  
Non\-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a term used to describe liver changes similar to those seen in alcoholic hepatitis in the absence of a history of alcohol abuse. It is relatively common and thought to affect around 3\-4% of the general population. The progression of disease in patients with NASH may be responsible for a proportion of patients previously labelled as cryptogenic cirrhosis.  
  
Associated factors  
* obesity
* type 2 diabetes mellitus
* hyperlipidaemia
* jejunoileal bypass
* sudden weight loss/starvation

  
Features  
* usually asymptomatic
* hepatomegaly
* ALT is typically greater than AST
* increased echogenicity on ultrasound

  
NICE produced guidelines on the investigation and management of NAFLD in 2016\. Key points:  
* there is no evidence to support screening for NAFLD in adults, even in at risk groups (e.g. type 2 diabetes)
* the guidelines are therefore based on the management of the *incidental* finding of NAFLD \- typically asymptomatic fatty changes on liver ultrasound
* in these patients, NICE recommends the use of the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) blood test to check for advanced fibrosis
* the ELF blood test is a combination of hyaluronic acid \+ procollagen III \+ tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1\. An algorithm based on these values results in an ELF blood test score, similar to triple testing for Down's syndrome

  
An excellent review by Byrne et Al1 in 2018 reviewed the diagnosis and monitoring of NAFLD. It made the following suggestions if the ELF blood test was not available:  
* non\-invasive tests may be used to assess the severity of fibrosis
* these include the FIB4 score or NALFD fibrosis score
* these scores may be used in combination with a FibroScan (liver stiffness measurement assessed with transient elastography)
* this combination has been shown to have excellent accuracy in predicting fibrosis

  
Patients who are likely to have advanced fibrosis should be referred to a liver specialist. They will then likely have a liver biopsy to stage the disease more accurately.  
  
Management  
* the mainstay of treatment is lifestyle changes (particularly weight loss) and monitoring
* there is ongoing research into the role of gastric banding and insulin\-sensitising drugs (e.g. metformin, pioglitazone)
