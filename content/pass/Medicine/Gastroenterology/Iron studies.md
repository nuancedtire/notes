Serum iron  
  
Total iron binding capacity (TIBC)  
* transferrin
* raised in iron deficiency anaemia (IDA)
* raised in pregnancy and by oestrogen

  
Transferrin saturation  
* calculated by serum iron / TIBC

  
Ferritin  
* raised in inflammatory disorders
* low in IDA

  
Rarer tests  
* transferrin receptors increased in IDA

  
Anaemia of chronic disease  
* normochromic/hypochromic, normocytic anaemia
* reduced serum and TIBC
* normal or raised ferritin
