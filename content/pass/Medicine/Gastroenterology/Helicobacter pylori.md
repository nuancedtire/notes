*Helicobacter pylori* is a Gram\-negative bacteria associated with a variety of gastrointestinal problems, principally peptic ulcer disease.  
  
Pathophysiology  
* *Helicobacter pylori* has 2 main mechanisms to survice in the acidic gastric environment:
	+ chemotaxis away from low pH areas, using its flagella to burrow into the mucous lining to reach the epithelial cells underneath
	+ secretes urease → urea converted to NH3 → alkalinization of acidic environment → increased bacterial survival
* pathogenesis mechanism:
	+ *Helicobacter pylori* releases bacterial cytotoxins (e.g. CagA toxin) → disruption of gastric mucosa

  
Associations  
* peptic ulcer disease
	+ 95% of duodenal ulcers
	+ 75% of gastric ulcers
* gastric cancer
* B cell lymphoma of MALT tissue (eradication of H pylori results causes regression in 80% of patients)
* atrophic gastritis

  
The role of H pylori in Gastro\-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is unclear \- there is currently no role in GORD for the eradication of H pylori  
  
Management   
* eradication may be achieved with a 7\-day course of
	+ a proton pump inhibitor \+ amoxicillin \+ (clarithromycin OR metronidazole)
	+ if penicillin\-allergic: a proton pump inhibitor \+ metronidazole \+ clarithromycin
