Until recent times oesophageal cancer was most commonly due to a squamous cell carcinoma but the incidence of adenocarcinoma is rising rapidly. Adenocarcinoma is now the most common type of oesophageal cancer and is more likely to develop in patients with a history of gastro\-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) or Barrett's.  
  
The majority of adenocarcinomas are located near the gastroesophageal junction whereas squamous cell tumours are most commonly found in the upper two\-thirds of the oesophagus.  
  


|  | Adenocarcinoma | Squamous cell cancer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Epidemiology** | Most common type in the UK/US | Most common type in the developing world |
| **Location** | Lower third \- near the gastroesophageal junction | Upper two\-thirds of the oesophagus |
| **Risk factors** | * GORD * Barrett's oesophagus * smoking * obesity | * smoking * alcohol * achalasia * Plummer\-Vinson syndrome * diets rich in nitrosamines |

  
Features  
* dysphagia: the most common presenting symptom
* anorexia and weight loss
* vomiting
* other possible features include: odynophagia, hoarseness, melaena, cough

  
Diagnosis  
* Upper GI endoscopy with biopsy is used for diagnosis
* Endoscopic ultrasound is the preferred method for locoregional staging
* CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is used for initial staging
	+ FDG\-PET CT may be used for detecting occult metastases if metastases are not seen on the initial staging CT scans.
	+ Laparoscopy is sometimes performed to detect occult peritoneal disease

Treatment  
* Operable disease (T1N0M0\) is best managed by surgical resection \- the most common procedure is an Ivor\-Lewis type oesophagectomy
* The biggest surgical challenge is that of anastomotic leak, with an intrathoracic anastomosis resulting in mediastinitis
* In addition to surgical resection many patients will be treated with adjuvant chemotherapy
