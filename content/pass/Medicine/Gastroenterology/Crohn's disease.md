Crohn's disease is a form of inflammatory bowel disease. It commonly affects the terminal ileum and colon but may be seen anywhere from the mouth to anus.  
  
Pathology  
* the cause is unknown but there is a strong genetic susceptibility
* inflammation occurs in all layers, down to the serosa
	+ this is why patients with Crohn's are prone to strictures, fistulas and adhesions
* whilst it may cause inflammation anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, the disease burden is not evenly distributed:
	+ 80% of patients have small bowel involvement, usually in the ileum, with around 30% of patients having ileitis exclusively
	+ 50% of patients have ileocolitis
	+ 20% of patients have colitis exclusively
	+ 30% of patients have perianal disease

  
Crohn's disease typically presents in late adolescence or early adulthood. Features include:  
* presentation may be non\-specific symptoms such as weight loss and lethargy
* diarrhoea
	+ the most prominent symptom in adults
	+ Crohn's colitis may cause bloody diarrhoea
* abdominal pain: the most prominent symptom in children
* perianal disease: e.g. Skin tags or ulcers
* extra\-intestinal features are more common in patients with colitis or perianal disease

   
Investigations  
* raised inflammatory markers
* increased faecal calprotectin
* anaemia
* low vitamin B12 and vitamin D

  
Questions regarding the 'extra\-intestinal' features of inflammatory bowel disease are common:  
  


|  | **Common to both Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC)** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Related to disease activity** | Arthritis: pauciarticular, asymmetric Erythema nodosum Episcleritis Osteoporosis | Arthritis is the most common extra\-intestinal feature in both CD and UC Episcleritis is more common in CD |
| **Unrelated to disease activity** | Arthritis: polyarticular, symmetric Uveitis Pyoderma gangrenosum Clubbing Primary sclerosing cholangitis | Primary sclerosing cholangitis is much more common in UC Uveitis is more common in UC |
