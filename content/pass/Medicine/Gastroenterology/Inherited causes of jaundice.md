There are 4 inherited causes of jaundice you need to be aware of: Gilbert's syndrome, Crigler\-Najjar syndrome, Dubin\-Johnson syndrome and Rotor's syndrome. It is important for the exam to be able to classify them according to whether they cause conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia:  
  


| **Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia** | **Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia** |
| --- | --- |
| Gilbert's syndromeCrigler\-Najjar syndrome | Dubin\-Johnson syndromeRotor syndrome |

  
Important points for the exam:
------------------------------

  
Gilbert's syndrome  
* autosomal recessive
* mild deficiency of UDP\-glucuronyl transferase
* benign

  
Crigler\-Najjar syndrome, type 1  
* autosomal recessive
* absolute deficiency of UDP\-glucuronosyl transferase
* do not survive to adulthood

  
Crigler\-Najjar syndrome, type 2  
* slightly more common than type 1 and less severe
* may improve with phenobarbital

  
Dubin\-Johnson syndrome  
* autosomal recessive. Relatively common in Iranian Jews
* mutation in the canalicular multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2\) results in defective hepatic excretion of bilirubin
* results in a grossly black liver
* benign

  
Rotor syndrome  
* autosomal recessive
* defect in the hepatic uptake and storage of bilirubin
* benign
