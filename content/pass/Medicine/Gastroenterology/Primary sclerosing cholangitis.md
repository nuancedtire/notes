Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a biliary disease of unknown aetiology characterised by inflammation and fibrosis of intra and extra\-hepatic bile ducts.  
  
Associations  
* ulcerative colitis: 4% of patients with UC have PSC, 80% of patients with PSC have UC
* Crohn's (much less common association than UC)
* HIV

  
Features  
* cholestasis
	+ jaundice, pruritus
	+ raised bilirubin \+ ALP
* right upper quadrant pain
* fatigue

  
Investigation  
* endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are the standard diagnostic investigations, showing multiple biliary strictures giving a 'beaded' appearance
* p\-ANCA may be positive
* there is a limited role for liver biopsy, which may show fibrous, obliterative cholangitis often described as 'onion skin'

  
Complications  
* cholangiocarcinoma (in 10%)
* increased risk of colorectal cancer
