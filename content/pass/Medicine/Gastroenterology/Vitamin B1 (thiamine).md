Thiamine is a water soluble vitamin of the B complex group. One of it's phosphate derivates, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), is a coenzyme in the following enzymatic reactions:  
* pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
* pyruvate decarboxylase in ethanol fermentation
* alpha\-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex
* branched\-chain amino acid dehydrogenase complex
* 2\-hydroxyphytanoyl\-CoA lyase
* transketolase

  
Thiamine is therefore important in the catabolism of sugars and aminoacids. The clinical consequences of thiamine deficiency are therefore seen first in highly aerobic tissues such as the brain (Wenicke\-Korsakoff syndrome) and the heart (wet beriberi).  
  
Causes of thiamine deficiency:  
* alcohol excess. Thiamine supplements are the only routinely recommend supplement in patients with alcoholism
* malnutrition

  
Conditions associated with thiamine deficiency:  
* Wernicke's encephalopathy: nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia and ataxia
* Korsakoff's syndrome: amnesia, confabulation
* dry beriberi: peripheral neuropathy
* wet beriberi: dilated cardiomyopathy
