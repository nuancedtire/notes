Interpreting hepatitis B serology is a dying art form which still occurs at regular intervals in medical exams. It is important to remember a few key facts:  
* surface antigen (HBsAg) is the first marker to appear and causes the production of anti\-HBs
* HBsAg normally implies acute disease (present for 1\-6 months)
* if HBsAg is present for \> 6 months then this implies chronic disease (i.e. Infective)
* Anti\-HBs implies immunity (either exposure or immunisation). It is negative in chronic disease
* Anti\-HBc implies previous (or current) infection. IgM anti\-HBc appears during acute or recent hepatitis B infection and is present for about 6 months. IgG anti\-HBc persists
* HbeAg results from breakdown of core antigen from infected liver cells as is, therefore, a marker of infectivity. Marker of HBV replication and infectivity

  
Example results  
* previous immunisation: anti\-HBs positive, all others negative
* previous hepatitis B (\> 6 months ago), not a carrier: anti\-HBc positive, HBsAg negative
* previous hepatitis B, now a carrier: anti\-HBc positive, HBsAg positive

  
HBsAg \= ongoing infection, either acute or chronic if present \> 6 months  
  
anti\-HB**c** \= **c**aught, i.e. negative if immunized
