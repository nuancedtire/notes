The two main types of inflammatory bowel disease are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. They have many similarities in terms of presenting symptoms, investigation findings and management options.

Venn diagram showing shared features and differences between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Note that whilst some features are present in both, some are much more common in one of the conditions, for example colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis  
There are however some key differences which are highlighted in table below:  
  


|  | **Crohn's disease (CD)** | **Ulcerative colitis (UC)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Features** | Diarrhoea usually non\-bloody Weight loss more prominent Upper gastrointestinal symptoms, mouth ulcers, perianal diseaseAbdominal mass palpable in the right iliac fossa | Bloody diarrhoea more commonAbdominal pain in the left lower quadrantTenesmus |
| **Extra\-intestinal** | Gallstones are more common secondary to reduced bile acid reabsorption Oxalate renal stones\* | Primary sclerosing cholangitis more common |
| **Complications** | Obstruction, fistula, colorectal cancer | Risk of colorectal cancer high in UC than CD |
| **Pathology** | Lesions may be seen anywhere from the mouth to anusSkip lesions may be present | Inflammation always starts at rectum and never spreads beyond ileocaecal valveContinuous disease |
| **Histology** | Inflammation in all layers from mucosa to serosa* increased goblet cells * granulomas | No inflammation beyond submucosa (unless fulminant disease) \- inflammatory cell infiltrate in lamina propria* neutrophils migrate through the walls of glands to form crypt abscesses * depletion of goblet cells and mucin from gland epithelium * granulomas are infrequent |
| **Endoscopy** | Deep ulcers, skip lesions \- 'cobble\-stone' appearance | Widespread ulceration with preservation of adjacent mucosa which has the appearance of polyps ('pseudopolyps') |
| **Radiology** | Small bowel enema* high sensitivity and specificity for examination of the terminal ileum * strictures: 'Kantor's string sign' * proximal bowel dilation * 'rose thorn' ulcers * fistulae | Barium enema* loss of haustrations * superficial ulceration, 'pseudopolyps' * long standing disease: colon is narrow and short \-'drainpipe colon' |

  
\*impaired bile acid rebsorption increases the loss calcium in the bile. Calcium normally binds oxalate.
