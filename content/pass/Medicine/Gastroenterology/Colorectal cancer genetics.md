It is currently thought there are three types of colon cancer:  
* sporadic (95%)
* hereditary non\-polyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC, 5%)
* familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP, \<1%)

  
Studies have shown that sporadic colon cancer may be due to a series of genetic mutations. For example, more than half of colon cancers show allelic loss of the APC gene. It is believed a further series of gene abnormalities e.g. activation of the K\-ras oncogene, deletion of p53 and DCC tumour suppressor genes lead to invasive carcinoma.  
  
HNPCC (Lynch syndrome), an autosomal dominant condition, is the most common form of inherited colon cancer. Around 90% of patients develop cancers, often of the proximal colon, which are usually poorly differentiated and highly aggressive. Currently seven mutations have been identified, which affect genes involved in DNA mismatch repair leading to microsatellite instability. The most common genes involved are:  
* MSH2 (60% of cases)
* MLH1 (30%)

  
Patients with HNPCC are also at a higher risk of other cancers, with endometrial cancer being the next most common association, after colon cancer.  
  
The Amsterdam criteria are sometimes used to aid diagnosis:  
* at least 3 family members with colon cancer
* the cases span at least two generations
* at least one case diagnosed before the age of 50 years

  
FAP is a rare autosomal dominant condition which leads to the formation of hundreds of polyps by the age of 30\-40 years. Patients inevitably develop carcinoma. It is due to a mutation in a tumour suppressor gene called adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC), located on chromosome 5\. Genetic testing can be done by analysing DNA from a patient's white blood cells. Patients generally have a total proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) formation in their twenties.   
  
Patients with FAP are also at risk from duodenal tumours. A variant of FAP called Gardner's syndrome can also feature osteomas of the skull and mandible, retinal pigmentation, thyroid carcinoma and epidermoid cysts on the skin
