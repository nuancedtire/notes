Treatment can be divided into inducing and maintaining remission. NICE updated their guidelines on the management of ulcerative colitis in 2019\.  
  
The severity of UC is usually classified as being mild, moderate or severe:  
* mild: \< 4 stools/day, only a small amount of blood
* moderate: 4\-6 stools/day, varying amounts of blood, no systemic upset
* severe: \>6 bloody stools per day \+ features of systemic upset (pyrexia, tachycardia, anaemia, raised inflammatory markers)

  
Inducing remission
------------------

  
Treating mild\-to\-moderate ulcerative colitis  
* proctitis
	+ topical (rectal) aminosalicylate: for distal colitis rectal mesalazine has been shown to be superior to rectal steroids and oral aminosalicylates
	+ if remission is not achieved within 4 weeks, add an oral aminosalicylate
	+ if remission still not achieved add topical or oral corticosteroid
* proctosigmoiditis and left\-sided ulcerative colitis
	+ topical (rectal) aminosalicylate
	+ if remission is not achieved within 4 weeks, add a high\-dose oral aminosalicylate OR switch to a high\-dose oral aminosalicylate and a topical corticosteroid
	+ if remission still not achieved stop topical treatments and offer an oral aminosalicylate and an oral corticosteroid
* extensive disease
	+ topical (rectal) aminosalicylate and a high\-dose oral aminosalicylate:
	+ if remission is not achieved within 4 weeks, stop topical treatments and offer a high\-dose oral aminosalicylate and an oral corticosteroid

  
Severe colitis   
* should be treated in hospital
* IV steroids are usually given first\-line
	+ IV ciclosporin may be used if steroids are contraindicated
* if after 72 hours there has been no improvement, consider adding IV ciclosporin to IV corticosteroids or consider surgery

  
  
Maintaining remission
---------------------

  
Following a mild\-to\-moderate ulcerative colitis flare  
* proctitis and proctosigmoiditis
	+ topical (rectal) aminosalicylate alone (daily or intermittent) or
	+ an oral aminosalicylate plus a topical (rectal) aminosalicylate (daily or intermittent) or
	+ an oral aminosalicylate by itself: this may not be effective as the other two options
* left\-sided and extensive ulcerative colitis
	+ low maintenance dose of an oral aminosalicylate

  
Following a severe relapse or \>\=2 exacerbations in the past year  
* oral azathioprine or oral mercaptopurine

  
  
Other points  
* methotrexate is not recommended for the management of UC (in contrast to Crohn's disease)
* there is some evidence that probiotics may prevent relapse in patients with mild to moderate disease
