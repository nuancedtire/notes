Ferritin is an intracellular protein that binds iron and stores it to be released in a controlled fashion at sites where iron is required.   
  
Increased ferritin levels
-------------------------

  
This is typically defined as \> 300 µg/L in men/postmenopausal women and \> 200 µµg/L in premenopausal women.  
  
Ferritin is an acute phase protein and may be synthesised in increased quantities in situations where inflammatory activity is ongoing. Falsely elevated results may therefore be encountered clinically and need to be taken in the context of the clinical picture and blood results.  
  
We can split the causes of increased ferritin levels into 2 distinct categories;  
  


| Without iron overload (around 90% of patients) | With iron overload (around 10% of patients) |
| --- | --- |
| Inflammation (due to ferritin being an acute phase reactant)Alcohol excessLiver diseaseChronic kidney diseaseMalignancy | Primary iron overload (hereditary haemochromatosis)Secondary iron overload (e.g. following repeated transfusions) |

  
The best test to see whether iron overload is present is **transferrin saturation**. Typically, normal values of \< 45% in females and \< 50% in males exclude iron overload.  
  
Reduced ferritin levels
-----------------------

  
Because iron and ferritin are bound the total body ferritin levels may be decreased in cases of iron deficiency anaemia.   
  
Measurement of serum ferritin levels can be useful in determining whether an apparently low haemoglobin and microcytosis is truly caused by an iron deficiency state.
