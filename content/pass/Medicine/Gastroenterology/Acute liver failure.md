Acute liver failure describes the rapid onset of hepatocellular dysfunction leading to a variety of systemic complications.  
  
Causes  
* paracetamol overdose
* alcohol
* viral hepatitis (usually A or B)
* acute fatty liver of pregnancy

  
Features\*  
* jaundice
* coagulopathy: raised prothrombin time
* hypoalbuminaemia
* hepatic encephalopathy
* renal failure is common ('hepatorenal syndrome')

  
\*remember that 'liver function tests' do not always accurately reflect the synthetic function of the liver. This is best assessed by looking at the prothrombin time and albumin level.
