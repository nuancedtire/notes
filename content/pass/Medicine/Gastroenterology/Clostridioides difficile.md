*Clostridioides difficile* is a Gram positive rod often encountered in hospital practice. It produces an exotoxin which causes intestinal damage leading to a syndrome called pseudomembranous colitis. *C. difficile* develops when the normal gut flora are suppressed by broad\-spectrum antibiotics. Clindamycin is historically associated with causing *C. difficile* but the aetiology has evolved significantly over the past 10 years. Second and third\-generation cephalosporins are now the leading cause of *C. difficile*.  
  
Other than antibiotics, risk factors include:  
* proton pump inhibitors

  
Pathophysiology  
* anaerobic gram\-positive, spore\-forming, toxin\-producing bacillus
* transmission: via the faecal\-oral route by ingestion of spores
* releases two exotoxins (toxin A and toxin B) that act on intestinal epithelial cells and inflammatory cells resulting in colitis

  
Features  
* diarrhoea
* abdominal pain
* a **raised white blood cell count (WCC)** is characteristic
* if severe toxic megacolon may develop

  
The Public Health England severity scale is often used as this may determine treatment:  
  


| Mild | Moderate | Severe | Life\-threatening |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Normal WCC | ↑ WCC ( \< 15 x 109/L)Typically 3\-5 loose stools per day | ↑ WCC ( \> 15 x 109/L) or an acutely ↑ creatinine (\> 50% above baseline) or a temperature \> 38\.5°C or evidence of severe colitis(abdominal or radiological signs) | HypotensionPartial or complete ileusToxic megacolon, or CT evidence of severe disease |

  
Diagnosis  
* is made by detecting *C. difficile* **toxin** (CDT) in the stool
* *C. difficile* **antigen** positivity only shows exposure to the bacteria, rather than current infection

  
Management
----------

  
Current antibiotic therapy should be reviewed and antibiotics stopped if possible.  
  
First episode of *C. difficile* infection  
* **first\-line therapy is oral vancomycin** for 10 days
* second\-line therapy: oral fidaxomicin
* third\-line therapy: oral vancomycin \+/\- IV metronidazole

  
Recurrent episode   
* recurrent infection occurs in around 20% of patients, increasing to 50% after their second episode
* within 12 weeks of symptom resolution: oral fidaxomicin
* after 12 weeks of symptom resolution: oral vancomycin OR fidaxomicin

  
Life\-threatening *C. difficile* infection  
* oral vancomycin AND IV metronidazole
* specialist advice \- surgery may be considered

  
Other therapies  
* bezlotoxumab is a monoclonal antibody which targets *C. difficile* toxin B
	+ NICE do not currently support its use to prevent recurrences as it is not cost\-effective
* faecal microbiota transplant
	+ may be considered for patients who've had 2 or more previous episodes

  
Preventing the spread of *C. difficile* infection  
* isolation in side room: the patient should remain isolated until there has been no diarrhoea (types 5\-7

on the Bristol Stool Chart) for at least 48 hours  
* all staff should wear disposable gloves and an apron during any contact with patients known to have *C. difficile*
* hand washing is also essential \- alcohol gel does not kill the spores of *C. difficile*
