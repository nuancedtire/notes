The table below gives characteristic exam question features for conditions causing dysphagia. Remember that new\-onset dysphagia is a red flag symptom that requires urgent endoscopy, regardless of age or other symptoms.  
  


| Causes | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Oesophageal cancer** | Dysphagia may be associated with weight loss, anorexia or vomiting during eatingPast history may include Barrett's oesophagus, GORD, excessive smoking or alcohol use |
| **Oesophagitis** | There may be a history of heartburnOdynophagia but no weight loss and systemically well |
| **Oesophageal candidiasis** | There may be a history of HIV or other risk factors such as steroid inhaler use |
| **Achalasia** | Dysphagia of both liquids and solids from the startHeartburnRegurgitation of food \- may lead to cough, aspiration pneumonia etc |
| **Pharyngeal pouch** | More common in older menRepresents a posteromedial herniation between thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus musclesUsually not seen but if large then a midline lump in the neck that gurgles on palpationTypical symptoms are dysphagia, regurgitation, aspiration and chronic cough. Halitosis may occasionally be seen |
| **Systemic sclerosis** | Other features of CREST syndrome may be present, namely Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, oEsophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, TelangiectasiaAs well as oesophageal dysmotility the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) pressure is decreased. This contrasts to achalasia where the LES pressure is increased |
| **Myasthenia gravis** | Other symptoms may include extraocular muscle weakness or ptosisDysphagia with liquids as well as solids |
| **Globus hystericus** | There may be a history of anxietySymptoms are often intermittent and relieved by swallowingUsually painless \- the presence of pain should warrant further investigation for organic causes |

  
  
Causes of dysphagia \- by classification
----------------------------------------

  
As with many conditions, it's often useful to think about causes of a symptom in a structured way:  
  


| Classification | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| **Extrinsic** | * Mediastinal masses * Cervical spondylosis |
| **Oesophageal wall** | * Achalasia * Diffuse oesophageal spasm * Hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter |
| **Intrinsic** | * Tumours * Strictures * Oesophageal web * Schatzki rings |
| **Neurological** | * CVA * Parkinson's disease * Multiple Sclerosis * Brainstem pathology * Myasthenia Gravis |

  
Investigation
-------------

  
All patients require an upper GI endoscopy unless there are compelling reasons for this not to be performed. Motility disorders may be best appreciated by undertaking fluoroscopic swallowing studies.   
  
A full blood count should be performed.  
  
Ambulatory oesophageal pH and manometry studies will be required to evaluate conditions such as achalasia and patients with GORD being considered for fundoplication surgery.
