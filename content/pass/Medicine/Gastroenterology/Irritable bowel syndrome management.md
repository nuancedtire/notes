The management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is often difficult and varies considerably between patients. NICE updated it's guidelines in 2015\.  
  
First\-line pharmacological treatment \- according to predominant symptom  
* pain: antispasmodic agents
* constipation: laxatives but avoid lactulose
* diarrhoea: loperamide is first\-line

  
For patients with constipation who are not responding to conventional laxatives linaclotide may be considered, if:  
* optimal or maximum tolerated doses of previous laxatives from different classes have not helped and
* they have had constipation for at least 12 months

  
Second\-line pharmacological treatment  
* low\-dose tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. amitriptyline 5\-10 mg) are used in preference to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

  
Other management options  
* psychological interventions \- if symptoms do not respond to pharmacological treatments after 12 months and who develop a continuing symptom profile (refractory IBS), consider referring for cognitive behavioural therapy, hypnotherapy or psychological therapy
* complementary and alternative medicines: 'do not encourage use of acupuncture or reflexology for the treatment of IBS'

  
General dietary advice  
* have regular meals and take time to eat
* avoid missing meals or leaving long gaps between eating
* drink at least 8 cups of fluid per day, especially water or other non\-caffeinated drinks such as herbal teas
* restrict tea and coffee to 3 cups per day
* reduce intake of alcohol and fizzy drinks
* consider limiting intake of high\-fibre food (for example, wholemeal or high\-fibre flour and breads, cereals high in bran, and whole grains such as brown rice)
* reduce intake of 'resistant starch' often found in processed foods
* limit fresh fruit to 3 portions per day
* for diarrhoea, avoid sorbitol
* for wind and bloating consider increasing intake of oats (for example, oat\-based breakfast cereal or porridge) and linseeds (up to one tablespoon per day).
