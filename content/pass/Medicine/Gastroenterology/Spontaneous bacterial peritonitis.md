Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a form of peritonitis usually seen in patients with ascites secondary to liver cirrhosis.  
  
Features  
* ascites
* abdominal pain
* fever

  
Diagnosis  
* paracentesis: neutrophil count \> 250 cells/ul
* the most common organism found on ascitic fluid culture is *E. coli*

  
Management  
* intravenous cefotaxime is usually given

  
Antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to patients with ascites if:  
* patients who have had an episode of SBP
* patients with fluid protein \<15 g/l and either Child\-Pugh score of at least 9 or hepatorenal syndrome
* NICE recommend: '*Offer prophylactic oral ciprofloxacin or norfloxacin for people with cirrhosis and ascites with an ascitic protein of 15 g/litre or less until the ascites has resolved*'

  
Alcoholic liver disease is a marker of poor prognosis in SBP.
