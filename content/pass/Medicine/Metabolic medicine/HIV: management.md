Antiretroviral therapy (ART) involves a combination of at least three drugs, typically two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and either a protease inhibitor (PI) or a non\-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). This combination both decreases viral replication but also reduces the risk of viral resistance emerging  
  
Following the 2015 BHIVA guidelines it is now recommended that patients start ART as soon as they have been diagnosed with HIV, rather than waiting until a particular CD4 count, as was previously advocated.  
  
Entry inhibitors   
* maraviroc (binds to CCR5, preventing an interaction with gp41\), enfuvirtide (binds to gp41, also known as a 'fusion inhibitor')
* prevent HIV\-1 from entering and infecting immune cells

  
Nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)  
* examples: zidovudine (AZT), abacavir, emtricitabine, didanosine, lamivudine, stavudine, zalcitabine, tenofovir
* general NRTI side\-effects: peripheral neuropathy
* tenofovir: used in BHIVAs two recommended regime NRTI. Adverse effects include renal impairment and ostesoporosis
* zidovudine: anaemia, myopathy, black nails
* didanosine: pancreatitis

  
Non\-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)  
* examples: nevirapine, efavirenz
* side\-effects: P450 enzyme interaction (nevirapine induces), rashes

  
Protease inhibitors (PI)  
* examples: indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir
* side\-effects: diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, buffalo hump, central obesity, P450 enzyme inhibition
* indinavir: renal stones, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinaemia
* ritonavir: a potent inhibitor of the P450 system

  
Integrase inhibitors  
* block the action of integrase, a viral enzyme that inserts the viral genome into the DNA of the host cell
* examples: raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir
