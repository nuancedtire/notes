Whilst the organism *Pneumocystis carinii* is now referred to as *Pneumocystis jiroveci*, the term *Pneumocystis carinii* pneumonia (PCP) is still in common use  
* *Pneumocystis jiroveci* is an unicellular eukaryote, generally classified as a fungus but some authorities consider it a protozoa
* PCP is the most common opportunistic infection in AIDS
* all patients with a CD4 count \< 200/mmÂ³ should receive PCP prophylaxis

  
Features  
* dyspnoea
* dry cough
* fever
* very few chest signs

  
Pneumothorax is a common complication of PCP.  
  
Extrapulmonary manifestations are rare (1\-2% of cases), may cause  
* hepatosplenomegaly
* lymphadenopathy
* choroid lesions

  
Investigation  
* CXR: typically shows bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates but can present with other x\-ray findings e.g. lobar consolidation. May be normal
* exercise\-induced desaturation
* sputum often fails to show PCP, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) often needed to demonstrate PCP (silver stain shows characteristic cysts)

Management  
* co\-trimoxazole
* IV pentamidine in severe cases
* aerosolized pentamidine is an alternative treatment for *Pneumocystis jiroveci* pneumonia but is less effective with a risk of pneumothorax
* steroids if hypoxic (if pO2 \< 9\.3kPa then steroids reduce risk of respiratory failure by 50% and death by a third)
