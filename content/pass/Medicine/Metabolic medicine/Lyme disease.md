Lyme disease is caused by the spirochaete *Borrelia burgdorferi* and is spread by ticks.  
  
Early features (within 30 days)  
* erythema migrans
	+ 'bulls\-eye' rash is typically at the site of the tick bite
	+ typically develops 1\-4 weeks after the initial bite but may present sooner
	+ usually painless, more than 5 cm in diameter and slowlly increases in size
	+ present in around 80% of patients.
* systemic features
	+ headache
	+ lethargy
	+ fever
	+ arthralgia

Later features (after 30 days)  
* cardiovascular
	+ heart block
	+ peri/myocarditis
* neurological
	+ facial nerve palsy
	+ radicular pain
	+ meningitis

Investigation  
* NICE recommend that Lyme disease can be diagnosed clinically if erythema migrans is present
	+ erythema migrans is therefore an indication to start antibiotics
* enzyme\-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibodies to *Borrelia burgdorferi* are the first\-line test
	+ if negative and Lyme disease is still suspected in people tested within 4 weeks from symptom onset, repeat the ELISA 4\-6 weeks after the first ELISA test. If still suspected in people who have had symptoms for 12 weeks or more then an immunoblot test should be done
	+ if positive or equivocal then an immunoblot test for Lyme disease should be done

  
Management of asymptomatic tick bites  
* tick bites can be a relatively common presentation to GP practices, and can cause significant anxiety
* if the tick is still present, the best way to remove it is using fine\-tipped tweezers, grasping the tick as close to the skin as possible and pulling upwards firmly. The area should be washed following.
* NICE guidance does not recommend routine antibiotic treatment to patients who've suffered a tick bite

  
Management of suspected/confirmed Lyme disease  
* doxycycline if early disease. Amoxicillin is an alternative if doxycycline is contraindicated (e.g. pregnancy)
	+ people with erythema migrans should be commenced on antibiotic without the need for further tests
* ceftriaxone if disseminated disease
* Jarisch\-Herxheimer reaction is sometimes seen after initiating therapy: fever, rash, tachycardia after first dose of antibiotic (more commonly seen in syphilis, another spirochaetal disease)
