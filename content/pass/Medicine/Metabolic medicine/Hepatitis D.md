Hepatitis D is a single stranded RNA virus that is transmitted parenterally. It is an incomplete RNA virus that requires hepatitis B surface antigen to complete its replication and transmission cycle.   
  
It is transmitted in a similar fashion to hepatitis B (exchange of bodily fluids) and patients may be infected with hepatitis B and hepatitis D at the same time.  
  
Hepatitis D terminology:  
* Co\-infection: Hepatitis B and Hepatitis D infection at the same time.
* Superinfection: A hepatitis B surface antigen positive patient subsequently develops a hepatitis D infection.

  
Superinfection is associated with high risk of fulminant hepatitis, chronic hepatitis status and cirrhosis.  
  
Diagnosis is made via reverse polymerase chain reaction of hepatitis D RNA. Interferon is currently used as treatment, but with a poor evidence base.
