Leptospirosis is caused by the spirochaete *Leptospira interrogans* (serogroup *L. icterohaemorrhagiae*), classically being spread by contact with infected rat urine.   
  
Epidemiology  
* leptospirosis is commonly seen in questions referring to sewage workers, farmers, vets or people who work in an abattoir
* however, on an international level, leptospirosis is far more common in the tropics so should be considered in the returning traveller

  
Weil's disease should always be considered in high\-risk patients with hepatorenal failure  
  
Features  
* the early phase is due to bacteraemia and lasts around a week
	+ may be mild or subclinical
	+ fever
	+ flu\-like symptoms
	+ subconjunctival suffusion (redness)/haemorrhage
* second immune phase may lead to more severe disease (Weil's disease)
	+ acute kidney injury (seen in 50% of patients)
	+ hepatitis: jaundice, hepatomegaly
	+ aseptic meningitis

  
Investigation  
* **serology**: antibodies to *Leptospira* develop after about 7 days
* PCR
* culture
	+ growth may take several weeks so limits usefulness in diagnosis
	+ blood and CSF samples are generally positive for the first 10 days
	+ urine cultures become positive during the second week of illness

  
Management  
* high\-dose benzylpenicillin or doxycycline
