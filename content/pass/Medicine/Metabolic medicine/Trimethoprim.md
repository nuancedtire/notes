Trimethoprim is an antibiotic, mainly used in the management of urinary tract infections.  
  
Mechanism of action  
* interferes with DNA synthesis by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase
	+ may, therefore, interact with methotrexate, which also inhibits dihydrofolate reductase

  
Adverse effects  
* myelosuppression
* transient rise in creatinine: trimethoprim competitively inhibits the tubular secretion of creatinine resulting in a temporary increase which reverses upon stopping the drug
	+ trimethoprim blocks the ENaC channel in the distal nephron, causing a hyperkalaemic distal RTA (type 4\). It also inhibits creatinine secretion, often leading to an increase in creatinine by around 40 points (but not necessarily causing AKI)

  
Use in pregnancy  
* the BNF advises that there is a: '*Teratogenic risk in first trimester (folate antagonist). Manufacturers advise avoid during pregnancy.*'
