Bacterial vaginosis (BV) describes an overgrowth of predominately anaerobic organisms such as *Gardnerella vaginalis*. This leads to a consequent fall in lactic acid producing aerobic lactobacilli resulting in a raised vaginal pH.  
  
Whilst BV is not a sexually transmitted infection it is seen almost exclusively in sexually active women.  
   
Features  
* vaginal discharge: 'fishy', offensive
* asymptomatic in 50%

  
Amsel's criteria for diagnosis of BV \- 3 of the following 4 points should be present  
* thin, white homogenous discharge
* clue cells on microscopy: stippled vaginal epithelial cells
* vaginal pH \> 4\.5
* positive whiff test (addition of potassium hydroxide results in fishy odour)

  
Management  
* if the woman is asymptomatic, treatment is not usually required [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/bacterial-vaginosis/management/women-who-are-not-pregnant/#:~:text=If%20the%20woman%20is%20asymptomatic "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - Management of bacterial vaginosis")
	+ e.g. picked up on a swab done for different reasons
	+ exceptions include if a woman is undergoing a termination of pregnancy
* if symptomatic: oral metronidazole for 5\-7 days [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/bacterial-vaginosis/management/women-who-are-not-pregnant/#:~:text=If%20the%20woman%20is%20symptomatic "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - Management of bacterial vaginosis")
	+ 70\-80% initial cure rate
	+ relapse rate \> 50% within 3 months
	+ a single oral dose of metronidazole 2g may be used if adherence may be an issue
	+ the BNF suggests topical metronidazole or topical clindamycin as alternatives
* if pregnant [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/bacterial-vaginosis/management/women-who-are-not-pregnant/ "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - Management of bacterial vaginosis")
	+ results in an increased risk of preterm labour, low birth weight and chorioamnionitis, late miscarriage
	+ it was previously taught that oral metronidazole should be avoided in the first trimester and topical clindamycin used instead. Recent guidelines however recommend that oral metronidazole is used throughout pregnancy
	+ if asymptomatic: discuss with the woman's obstetrician if treatment is indicated
	+ if symptomatic: either oral metronidazole for 5\-7 days or topical treatment. The higher, stat dose of metronidazole mentioned above is not recommended

Clue cells \- epithelial cells develop a stippled appearance due to being covered with bacteria
