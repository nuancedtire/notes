Genital warts (also known as condylomata accuminata) are a common cause of attendance at genitourinary clinics. They are caused by the many varieties of the human papillomavirus HPV, especially types 6 \& 11\. It is now well established that HPV (primarily types 16,18 \& 33\) predisposes to cervical cancer.
