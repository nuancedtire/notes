*Mycoplasma pneumoniae* is a cause of atypical pneumonia which often affects younger patients. It is associated with a number of characteristic complications such as erythema multiforme and cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Epidemics of *Mycoplasma pneumoniae* classically occur every 4 years. It is important to recognise atypical pneumonia as it may not respond to penicillins or cephalosporins due to it lacking a peptidoglycan cell wall.  
  
Features  
* the disease typically has a prolonged and gradual onset
* flu\-like symptoms classically precede a dry cough
* bilateral consolidation on x\-ray
* complications may occur as below

  
Complications  
* cold agglutins (IgM): may cause an haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia
* erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum
* meningoencephalitis, Guillain\-Barre syndrome and other immune\-mediated neurological diseases
* bullous myringitis: painful vesicles on the tympanic membrane
* pericarditis/myocarditis
* gastrointestinal: hepatitis, pancreatitis
* renal: acute glomerulonephritis

  
Investigations  
* diagnosis is generally by Mycoplasma serology
* positive cold agglutination test â†’ peripheral blood smear may show red blood cell agglutination

  
Management  
* doxycycline or a macrolide (e.g. erythromycin/clarithromycin)
