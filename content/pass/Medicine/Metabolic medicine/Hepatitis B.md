Hepatitis B is a double\-stranded DNA hepadnavirus and is spread through exposure to infected blood or body fluids, including vertical transmission from mother to child. The incubation period is 6\-20 weeks.  
  
The features of hepatitis B include fever, jaundice and elevated liver transaminases.   
  
Complications of hepatitis B infection  
* chronic hepatitis (5\-10%). 'Ground\-glass' hepatocytes may be seen on light microscopy
* fulminant liver failure (1%)
* hepatocellular carcinoma
* glomerulonephritis
* polyarteritis nodosa
* cryoglobulinaemia

  
Immunisation against hepatitis B (please see the Greenbook link for more details)  
* children born in the UK are now vaccinated as part of the routine immunisation schedule. This is given at 2, 3 and 4 months of age
* at risk groups who should be vaccinated include: healthcare workers, intravenous drug users, sex workers, close family contacts of an individual with hepatitis B, individuals receiving blood transfusions regularly, chronic kidney disease patients who may soon require renal replacement therapy, prisoners, chronic liver disease patients
* contains HBsAg adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide adjuvant and is prepared from yeast cells using recombinant DNA technology
* around 10\-15% of adults fail to respond or respond poorly to 3 doses of the vaccine. Risk factors include age over 40 years, obesity, smoking, alcohol excess and immunosuppression
* testing for anti\-HBs is only recommended for those at risk of occupational exposure (i.e. Healthcare workers) and patients with chronic kidney disease. In these patients anti\-HBs levels should be checked 1\-4 months after primary immunisation
* the table below shows how to interpret anti\-HBs levels:

  


| **Anti\-HBs level (mIU/ml)** | **Response** |
| --- | --- |
| \> 100 | Indicates adequate response, no further testing required. Should still receive booster at 5 years |
| 10 \- 100 | Suboptimal response \- one additional vaccine dose should be given. If immunocompetent no further testing is required |
| \< 10 | Non\-responder. Test for current or past infection. Give further vaccine course (i.e. 3 doses again) with testing following. If still fails to respond then HBIG would be required for protection if exposed to the virus |

  
  
  
Management of hepatitis B  
* pegylated interferon\-alpha used to be the only treatment available. It reduces viral replication in up to 30% of chronic carriers. A better response is predicted by being female, \< 50 years old, low HBV DNA levels, non\-Asian, HIV negative, high degree of inflammation on liver biopsy
* whilst NICE still advocate the use of pegylated interferon firstl\-line other antiviral medications are increasingly used with an aim to suppress viral replication (not in a dissimilar way to treating HIV patients)
* examples include tenofovir, entecavir and telbivudine (a synthetic thymidine nucleoside analogue)
