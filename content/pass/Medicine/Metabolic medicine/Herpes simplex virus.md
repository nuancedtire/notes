There are two strains of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) in humans: HSV\-1 and HSV\-2\. Whilst it was previously thought HSV\-1 accounted for oral lesions (cold sores) and HSV\-2 for genital herpes it is now known there is considerable overlap  
  
Features  
* primary infection: may present with a severe gingivostomatitis
* cold sores
* painful genital ulceration

  
Management  
* gingivostomatitis: oral aciclovir, chlorhexidine mouthwash
* cold sores: topical aciclovir although the evidence base for this is modest
* genital herpes: oral aciclovir. Some patients with frequent exacerbations may benefit from longer term aciclovir

  
Pregnancy  
* elective caesarean section at term is advised if a primary attack of herpes occurs during pregnancy at greater than 28 weeks gestation
* women with recurrent herpes who are pregnant should be treated with suppressive therapy and be advised that the risk of transmission to their baby is low
