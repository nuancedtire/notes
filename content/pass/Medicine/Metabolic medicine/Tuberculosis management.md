The standard therapy for treating **active tuberculosis** is:  
  
Initial phase \- first 2 months (RIPE)  
* Rifampicin
* Isoniazid
* Pyrazinamide
* Ethambutol (the 2006 NICE guidelines now recommend giving a 'fourth drug' such as ethambutol routinely \- previously this was only added if drug\-resistant tuberculosis was suspected)

  
Continuation phase \- next 4 months  
* Rifampicin
* Isoniazid

  
The treatment for **latent tuberculosis** is 3 months of isoniazid (with pyridoxine) and rifampicin OR 6 months of isoniazid (with pyridoxine)  
  
Patients with **meningeal tuberculosis** are treated for a prolonged period (at least 12 months) with the addition of steroids  
  
**Directly observed therapy** with a three times a week dosing regimen may be   
indicated in certain groups, including:  
* homeless people with active tuberculosis
* patients who are likely to have poor concordance
* all prisoners with active or latent tuberculosis

  
  
Complications of treatment
--------------------------

  
Immune reconstitution disease  
* occurs typically 3\-6 weeks after starting treatment
* often presents with enlarging lymph nodes

  
Drug adverse effects  
* rifampicin
	+ potent liver enzyme inducer
	+ hepatitis, orange secretions
	+ flu\-like symptoms
* isoniazid
	+ peripheral neuropathy: prevent with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6\)
	+ hepatitis, agranulocytosis
	+ liver enzyme inhibitor
* pyrazinamide
	+ hyperuricaemia causing gout
	+ arthralgia, myalgia
	+ hepatitis
* ethambutol
	+ optic neuritis: check visual acuity before and during treatment
