Clostridia are gram\-positive, obligate anaerobic bacilli.  
  
*C. perfringens*  
* produces Î±\-toxin, a lecithinase, which causes gas gangrene (myonecrosis) and haemolysis
* features include tender, oedematous skin with haemorrhagic blebs and bullae. Crepitus may present on palpation

  
*C. botulinum*  
* typically seen in canned foods and honey
* prevents acetylcholine (ACh) release leading to flaccid paralysis

  
*C. difficile*  
* causes pseudomembranous colitis, typically seen after the use of broad\-spectrum antibiotics
* produces both an exotoxin and a cytotoxin

  
*C. tetani*  
* produces an exotoxin (tetanospasmin) that prevents the release of glycine from Renshaw cells in the spinal cord causing a spastic paralysis
