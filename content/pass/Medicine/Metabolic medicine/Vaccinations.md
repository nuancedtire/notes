In the ever\-evolving landscape of infectious diseases, vaccination remains one of the most effective tools in the prevention of morbidity and mortality.   
  
Vaccine types
-------------

  
It is important to be aware of vaccines which are of the live\-attenuated type as these may pose a risk to immunocompromised patients.   
  
The main types of vaccines are as follows:  
  
Live attenuated  
* utilise a weakened form of the pathogen to stimulate an immune response akin to a natural infection without causing the disease
* typically not recommended for individuals with compromised immune systems due to the live nature of the vaccine
* examples:
	+ BCG
	+ measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)
	+ influenza (intranasal)
	+ oral rotavirus
	+ oral polio
	+ yellow fever
	+ oral typhoid

  
Inactivated preparations  
* employ pathogens that have been killed, often by heat or chemicals, to elicit an immune response
* might require booster doses to maintain immunity as the induced immune response is generally weaker than live attenuated vaccines
* examples:
	+ rabies
	+ hepatitis A
	+ influenza (intramuscular)

  
Toxoid (inactivated toxin)  
* these vaccines are designed around the toxins produced by certain bacteria. The toxins are rendered harmless (detoxified) and used as antigens in the vaccine. When the immune system encounters these non\-toxic toxoids, it learns to combat the natural toxins the bacteria produce, providing immunity against the toxic effects of infections
* toxoid vaccines often require booster doses to maintain immunity since, like inactivated vaccines, the immune response they induce can wane over time
* examples:
	+ tetanus
	+ diphtheria
	+ pertussis

  
Subunit and conjugate vaccines are often grouped together. Subunit means that only part of the pathogen is used to generate an immunogenic response. A conjugate vaccine is a particular type that links the poorly immunogenic bacterial polysaccharide outer coats to proteins to make them more immunogenic  
* pneumococcus (conjugate)
* haemophilus (conjugate)
* meningococcus (conjugate)
* hepatitis B
* human papillomavirus

,  
Messenger RNA (mRNA)  
* introduce a piece of mRNA into cells which then produce a protein to trigger an immune response.
* examples: some COVID\-19 vaccines

  
Viral vector vaccines:  
* use a harmless virus (different from the target pathogen) to deliver critical parts of the target pathogen to stimulate an immune response
* can be produced more rapidly in response to emerging threats
* examples: some Ebola and COVID\-19 vaccines

  
Notes  
* influenza: different types are available, including whole inactivated virus, split virion (virus particles disrupted by detergent treatment) and sub\-unit (mainly haemagglutinin and neuraminidase)
* cholera: contains inactivated Inaba and Ogawa strains of Vibrio cholerae together with recombinant B\-subunit of the cholera toxin
* hepatitis B: contains HBsAg adsorbed onto aluminium hydroxide adjuvant and is prepared from yeast cells using recombinant DNA technology

  
Valency of vaccines
-------------------

  
The term 'valency' in vaccinology denotes the number of distinct antigenic components or serotypes a vaccine can protect against. Essentially, it specifies the extent of a vaccine's antigenic reach.  
  
Monovalent vaccines  
* contain a singular antigenic component, conferring immunity against one strain or subtype of a pathogen
* an example is the measles vaccine

  
Multivalent or polyvalent vaccines  
* these vaccines comprise multiple antigenic components, safeguarding against various strains or subtypes of a pathogen or, occasionally, multiple pathogens
* the quadrivalent influenza vaccine, protective against four distinct virus strains, exemplifies this category
