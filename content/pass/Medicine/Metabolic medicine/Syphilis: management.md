Management  
* intramuscular benzathine penicillin is the first\-line management
* alternatives: doxycycline
* nontreponemal (rapid plasma reagin \[RPR] or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory \[VDRL]) titres should be monitored after treatment to assess the response
	+ a fourfold decline in titres (e.g. 1:16 → 1:4 or 1:32 → 1:8\)is often considered an adequate response to treatment
* the Jarisch\-Herxheimer reaction is sometimes seen following treatment
	+ fever, rash, tachycardia after the first dose of antibiotic
	+ in contrast to anaphylaxis, there is no wheeze or hypotension
	+ it is thought to be due to the release of endotoxins following bacterial death and typically occurs within a few hours of treatment
	+ no treatment is needed other than antipyretics if required
