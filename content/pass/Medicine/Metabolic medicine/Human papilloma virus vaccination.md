It has been known for a long time that the human papillomavirus (HPV) which infects the keratinocytes of the skin and mucous membranes is carcinogenic.  
  
There are dozens of strains of HPV. The most important to remember are:  
* 6 \& 11: causes genital warts
* 16 \& 18: linked to a variety of cancers, most notably cervical cancer

  
HPV infection is linked to:  
* over 99\.7% of cervical cancers
	+ HPV testing is now integral to cervical cancer screening
	+ samples are first tested for HPV and only if they are positive is cytology then performed
* around 85% of anal cancers
* around 50% of vulval and vaginal cancers
* around 20\-30% of mouth and throat cancers

  
It should of course be remembered that there are other risk factors important in developing cervical cancer such as smoking, combined oral contraceptive pill use and high parity.  
  
  
Immunisation
------------

  
The UK has an HPV immunisation programme that provides protection against both the main oncogenic HPV strains (16 \& 18\) as well as the strains that commonly cause genital warts (6 \& 11\). The immunisation programme is aimed primarily at 12\-13 years olds, both girls and boys but the vaccine is also offered to gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) to protect against anal, throat and penile cancers.  
  
**All 12\- and 13\-year\-olds (girls AND boys)** in school Year 8 are offered the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.  
* the vaccine is normally given in school
* information given to parents and available on the NHS website make it clear that the child may receive the vaccine against parental wishes
* since September 2023 **one dose** is now given instead of two. This change followed evidence from large studies that one dose provided equivalent protection

  
Other groups  
* eligible GBMSM under the age of 25 also receive 1\-dose, offered through sexual health clinics
* eligible GBMSM aged 25 to 45 years receive a 2\-dose schedule, offered through sexual health clinics
* eligible individuals who are immunosuppressed or those known to be HIV\-positive receive a 3\-dose schedule
