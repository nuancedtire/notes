The *Salmonella* group contains many members, most of which cause diarrhoeal diseases. They are aerobic, Gram\-negative rods which are not normally present as commensals in the gut.   
  
Typhoid and paratyphoid are caused by *Salmonella typhi* and *Salmonella paratyphi* (types A, B \& C) respectively. They are often termed enteric fevers, producing systemic symptoms such as headache, fever, arthralgia.  
  
Pathophysiology  
* typhoid is transmitted via the faecal\-oral route (also in contaminated food and water)

  
Features  
* initially systemic upset as above
* relative bradycardia
* abdominal pain, distension
* constipation: although *Salmonella* is a recognised cause of diarrhoea, constipation is more common in typhoid
* rose spots: present on the trunk in 40% of patients, and are more common in paratyphoid

  
Possible complications include  
* osteomyelitis (especially in sickle cell disease where *Salmonella* is one of the most common pathogens)
* GI bleed/perforation
* meningitis
* cholecystitis
* chronic carriage (1%, more likely if adult females)
