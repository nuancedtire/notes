Gonorrhoea is caused by the Gram\-negative diplococcus *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*. Acute infection can occur on any mucous membrane surface, typically genitourinary but also rectum and pharynx. The incubation period of gonorrhoea is 2\-5 days  
  
Features  
* males: urethral discharge, dysuria
* females: cervicitis e.g. leading to vaginal discharge
* rectal and pharyngeal infection is usually asymptomatic

  
Microbiology  
* immunisation is not possible and reinfection is common due to antigen variation of type IV pili (proteins which adhere to surfaces) and Opa proteins (surface proteins which bind to receptors on immune cells)

  
Local complications that may develop include urethral strictures, epididymitis and salpingitis (hence may lead to infertility). Disseminated infection may occur \- see below  
  
Management  
* ciprofloxacin used to be the treatment of choice. However, there is increased resistance to ciprofloxacin (around 36% in the UK) and therefore cephalosporins are now more widely used
* there was a change in the 2019 British Society for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidelines. Previously the first\-line treatment was IM ceftriaxone \+ oral azithromycin. The new first\-line treatment is a single dose of IM ceftriaxone 1g (i.e. no longer add azithromycin). If sensitivities are known (and the organism is sensitive to ciprofloxacin) then a single dose of oral ciprofloxacin 500mg should be given
* if ceftriaxone is refused (e.g. needle\-phobic) then oral cefixime 400mg (single dose) \+ oral azithromycin 2g (single dose) should be used

Disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) and gonococcal arthritis may also occur, with gonococcal infection being the most common cause of septic arthritis in young adults. The pathophysiology of DGI is not fully understood but is thought to be due to haematogenous spread from mucosal infection (e.g. Asymptomatic genital infection). Initially there may be a classic triad of symptoms: tenosynovitis, migratory polyarthritis and dermatitis. Later complications include septic arthritis, endocarditis and perihepatitis (Fitz\-Hugh\-Curtis syndrome)  
  
Key features of disseminated gonococcal infection  
* tenosynovitis
* migratory polyarthritis
* dermatitis (lesions can be maculopapular or vesicular)
