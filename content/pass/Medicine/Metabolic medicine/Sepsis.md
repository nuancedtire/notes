Sepsis is defined as life\-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. Sepsis is increasingly recognised as an important cause of mortality in the UK and there has been increasing efforts recently to improve the care of patients who present with sepsis.   
  
How sepsis is classified has changed in recent years \- the Surviving Sepsis Guidelines were updated in 2017\.   
  
The new guidelines recognise the following terms:  
* **sepsis**: life\-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection
* **septic shock**: a more severe form sepsis, technically defined as *'in which circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities are associated with a greater risk of mortality than with sepsis alone'*\*

  
The old category of severe sepsis is no longer used.  
  
The term 'systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)' has also fallen out of favour. Adult patients outside of ICU with suspected infection are identified as being at heightened risk of mortality if they have quickSOFA (qSOFA) score meeting \>\= 2 of the following criteria: respiratory rate of 22/min or greater, altered mentation, or systolic blood pressure of 100mmHg or less   
  
**qSOFA score**  
Respiratory rate \> 22/min  
Altered mentation  
Systolic blood pressure \< 100 mm Hg  
  
  
Within an ICU setting a full SOFA\*\* score is often used. Details can be found at the bottom of the notes.  
  
Management
----------

  
NICE released its own guidelines in 2016\. These focussed on the risk stratification and management of patients with suspected.  
  
For risk stratification NICE recommend using the following criteria:  
  


| Red flag criteria | Amber flag criteria |
| --- | --- |
| * Responds only to voice or pain/ unresponsive * Acute confusional state * Systolic B.P \<\= 90 mmHg (or drop \>40 from normal) * Heart rate \> 130 per minute * Respiratory rate \>\= 25 per minute * Needs oxygen to keep SpO2 \>\=92% * Non\-blanching rash, mottled/ ashen/ cyanotic * Not passed urine in last 18 h/ UO \< 0\.5 ml/kg/hr * Lactate \>\=2 mmol/l * Recent chemotherapy | - Relatives concerned about mental status - Acute deterioration in functional ability - Immunosuppressed - Trauma/ surgery/ procedure in last 6 weeks - Respiratory rate 21\-24 - Systolic B.P 91\-100 mmHg - Heart rate 91\-130 OR new dysrhythmia - Not passed urine in last 12\-18 hours - Temperature \< 36ºC - Clinical signs of wound, device or skin infection |

  
Clearly, the underlying cause of the patient's sepsis needs to be identified and treated and the patient supported regardless of the cause or severity. If however any of the red flags are present the 'sepsis six' should be started straight away:  
* 1\. Administer oxygen: Aim to keep saturations \> 94% (88\-92% if at risk of CO2 retention e.g. COPD)
* 2\. Take blood cultures
* 3\. Give broad\-spectrum antibiotics
* 4\. Give intravenous fluid challenges
	+ NICE recommend a bolus of 500ml crystalloid over less than 15 minutes
* 5\. Measure serum lactate
* 6\. Measure accurate hourly urine output

  
\*these patients can be clinically identified by a vasopressor requirement to maintain a MAP ≥ 65mmHg and serum lactate \>2mmol/L in the absence of hypovolemia  
  
\*\*To help identify and categorise patients the Sequential (Sepsis\-Related) Organ Failure Assessment Score (SOFA) is increasingly used. The score grades abnormality by organ system and accounts for clinical interventions. However, laboratory variables, namely, PaO2, platelet count, creatinine level, and bilirubin level, are needed for full computation.  
  
**SOFA Score**  


| **System** | **Score 0** | **Score 1** | **Score 2** | **Score 3** | **Score 4** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PaO2 /FI O2 | \>400 | \<400 | \<300 | \<200 | \<100 |
| Platelets x103 microlitres | \>150 | \<150 | \<100 | \<50 | \<20 |
| Bilirubin µmol/L | 20 | 20\-32 | 33\-101 | 102\-204 | \>204 |
| Cardiovascular | MAP \>70mmHg | MAP 70mmHg | Dopamine \<5 or dobutamine (any dose) | Dopamine 5\.1\-15or epinephrine 0\.1or norepinephrine 0\.1 | Dopamine \>15 orepinephrine \>0\.1or norepinephrine \>0\.1 |
| GCS | 15 | 13\-14 | 10\-12 | 6\-9 | \<6 |
| Creatinine µmol/L | \<110 | 110\-170 | 171\-299 | 300\-440 | \>440 |
| Urine output ml/day | \>500 | \>500 | \>500 | \<500 | \<200 |

  
A SOFA score of 2 or more reflects an overall mortality risk of approximately 10% in a general hospital population with suspected infection. Even patients presenting with modest dysfunction can deteriorate further, emphasizing the seriousness of this condition and the need for prompt and appropriate intervention, if not already being instituted.
