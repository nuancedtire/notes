*Strongyloides stercoralis* is a human parasitic nematode worm. The larvae are present in soil and gain access to the body by penetrating the skin. Infection with *Strongyloides stercoralis* causes strongyloidiasis.  
  
Features  
* diarrhoea
* abdominal pain/bloating
* papulovesicular lesions where the skin has been penetrated by infective larvae e.g. soles of feet and buttocks
* larva currens: pruritic, linear, urticarial rash
* if the larvae migrate to the lungs a pneumonitis similar to Loeffler's syndrome may be triggered

  
Treatment  
* ivermectin and albendazole are used
