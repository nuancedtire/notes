There are two strains of the herpes simplex virus (HSV) in humans: HSV\-1 and HSV\-2\. Whilst it was previously thought HSV\-1 accounted for oral lesions (cold sores) and HSV\-2 for genital herpes it is now known there is considerable overlap  
  
Features  
* painful genital ulceration
	+ may be associated with dysuria and pruritus
* the primary infection is often more severe than recurrent episodes
	+ systemic features such as headache, fever and malaise are more common in primary episodes
* tender inguinal lymphadenopathy
* urinary retention may occur

  
Investigations  
* nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) is the investigation of choice in genital herpes and are now considered superior to viral culture
* HSV serology may be useful in certain situations such as recurrent genital ulceration of unknown cause

  
Management  
* general measures include:
	+ saline bathing
	+ analgesia
	+ topical anaesthetic agents e.g. lidocaine
* oral aciclovir
	+ some patients with frequent exacerbations may benefit from longer\-term aciclovir

  
Pregnancy  
* elective caesarean section at term is advised if a primary attack of herpes occurs during pregnancy at greater than 28 weeks gestation
* women with recurrent herpes who are pregnant should be treated with suppressive therapy and be advised that the risk of transmission to their baby is low
