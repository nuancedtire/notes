The table below summarises the characteristic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in meningitis:  
  


|  | **Bacterial** | **Viral** | **Tuberculous** | **Fungal** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | Cloudy | Clear/cloudy | Slight cloudy, fibrin web | Cloudy |
| **Glucose** | Low (\< 1/2 plasma) | 60\-80% of plasma glucose\* | Low (\< 1/2 plasma) | Low |
| **Protein** | High (\> 1 g/l) | Normal/raised | High (\> 1 g/l) | High |
| **White cells** | 10 \- 5,000 polymorphs/mm続 | 15 \- 1,000 lymphocytes/mm続 | 30 \- 300 lymphocytes/mm続 | 20 \- 200 lymphocytes/mm続 |

  
The Ziehl\-Neelsen stain is only 20% sensitive in the detection of tuberculous meningitis and therefore PCR is sometimes used (sensitivity \= 75%)  
  
\*mumps is unusual in being associated with a low glucose level in a proportion of cases. A low glucose may also be seen in herpes encephalitis
