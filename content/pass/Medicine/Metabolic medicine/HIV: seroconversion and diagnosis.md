HIV seroconversion is symptomatic in 60\-80% of patients and typically presents as a glandular fever type illness. Increased symptomatic severity is associated with poorer long term prognosis. It typically occurs 3\-12 weeks after infection  
  
Features  
* sore throat
* lymphadenopathy
* malaise, myalgia, arthralgia
* diarrhoea
* maculopapular rash
* mouth ulcers
* rarely meningoencephalitis

  
Diagnosis  
* HIV antibodies
	+ may not be present in early infection, but most people develop antibodies to HIV at 4\-6 weeks but 99% do by 3 months
	+ usually consists of both a screening ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immuno\-Sorbent Assay) test and a confirmatory Western Blot Assay
* p24 antigen
	+ a viral core protein that appears early in the blood as the viral RNA levels rise
	+ usually positive from about 1 week to 3 \- 4 weeks after infection with HIV
* combination tests (HIV p24 antigen and HIV antibody) are now standard for the diagnosis and screening of HIV
	+ if the combined test is positive it should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis
	+ some centres may also test the viral load (HIV RNA levels) if HIV is suspected at the same time
* testing for HIV in asymptomatic patients should be done at 4 weeks after possible exposure
* after an initial negative result when testing for HIV in an asymptomatic patient, offer a repeat test at 12 weeks
