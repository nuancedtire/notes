Gastroenteritis may either occur whilst at home or whilst travelling abroad (travellers' diarrhoea)  
  
Travellers' diarrhoea may be defined as at least 3 loose to watery stools in 24 hours with or without one of more of abdominal cramps, fever, nausea, vomiting or blood in the stool. The most common cause is *Escherichia coli*.  
  
Another pattern of illness is 'acute food poisoning'. This describes the sudden onset of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea after the ingestion of a toxin. Acute food poisoning is typically caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Bacillus cereus* or *Clostridium perfringens*.
