Cryptosporidiosis is the commonest protozoal cause of diarrhoea in the UK. Two species, *Cryptosporidium hominis* and *Cryptosporidium parvum* account for the majority cases.  
  
Cryptosporidiosis is more common in immunocompromised patients (e.g. HIV) and young children.  
  
Features  
* watery diarrhoea
* abdominal cramps
* fever
* in immunocompromised patients, the entire gastrointestinal tract may be affected resulting in complications such as sclerosing cholangitis and pancreatitis

  
Diagnosis  
* stool: modified Ziehl\-Neelsen stain (acid\-fast stain) of the stool may reveal the characteristic red cysts of Cryptosporidium

  
Management  
* is largely supportive for immunocompetent patients
* if the patient has HIV and is not on antiretroviral therapy then this should be started and often will be enough to resolve the infection
* nitazoxanide may be used for immunocompromised patients
* rifaximin is also sometimes used for immunocompromised patients/patients with severe disease
