The most common cause of non\-falciparum malaria is *Plasmodium vivax*, with *Plasmodium ovale* and *Plasmodium malariae* accounting for the other cases. *Plasmodium vivax* is often found in Central America and the Indian Subcontinent whilst **Plasmodium* ovale* typically comes from Africa.  
  
*Plasmodium knowlesi* is another non\-falciparum species which causes clinical pathology, found predominantly in South East Asia.  
  
Features  
* general features of malaria: fever, headache, splenomegaly
* *Plasmodium vivax/ovale*: cyclical fever every 48 hours. *Plasmodium malariae*: cyclical fever every 72 hours
* *Plasmodium malariae*: is associated with nephrotic syndrome.

  
Ovale and vivax malaria have a hypnozoite stage and may therefore relapse following treatment.  
  
Treatment  
* in areas which are known to be chloroquine\-sensitive then WHO recommend either an artemisinin\-based combination therapy (ACT) or chloroquine
* in areas which are known to be chloroquine\-resistant an ACT should be used
* ACTs should be avoided in pregnant women
* patients with ovale or vivax malaria should be given primaquine following acute treatment with chloroquine to destroy liver hypnozoites and prevent relapse
