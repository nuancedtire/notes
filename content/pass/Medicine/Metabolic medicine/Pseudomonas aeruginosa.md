*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is an aerobic Gram\-negative rod. It causes a number of clinically important infections in humans:  
* chest infections (especially in cystic fibrosis)
* skin: burns, wound infections, 'hot tub' folliculitis
* otitis externa (especially in diabetics who may develop malignant otitis externa)
* urinary tract infections

  
Lab features  
* Gram\-negative rod
* non\-lactose fermenting
* oxidase positive

  
Pathophysiology  
* produces both an endotoxin (causes fever and shock) and exotoxin A (inhibits protein synthesis by catalyzing ADP\-ribosylation of elongation factor EF\-2\)
