Diphtheria is caused by the Gram positive bacterium *Corynebacterium diphtheriae*   
  
Pathophysiology  
* releases an exotoxin encoded by a Î²\-prophage
* exotoxin inhibits protein synthesis by catalyzing ADP\-ribosylation of elongation factor EF\-2

  
Diphtheria toxin commonly causes a 'diphtheric membrane' on tonsils caused by necrotic mucosal cells. Systemic distribution may produce necrosis of myocardial, neural and renal tissue  
  
Possible presentations  
* recent visitors to Eastern Europe/Russia/Asia
* sore throat with a 'diphtheric membrane' \- grey, pseudomembrane on the posterior pharyngeal wall
* bulky cervical lymphadenopathy
	+ may result in a 'bull neck' appearanace
* neuritis e.g. cranial nerves
* heart block

  
Investigations  
* culture of throat swab: uses tellurite agar or Loeffler's media

  
Management  
* intramuscular penicillin
* diphtheria antitoxin
