Two main form of this protozoal disease are recognised \- African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) and American trypanosomiasis (Chagas' disease).  
  
Two forms of **African trypanosomiasis**, or **sleeping sickness**, are seen \- *Trypanosoma gambiense* in West Africa and *Trypanosoma rhodesiense* in East Africa. Both types are spread by the tsetse fly. *Trypanosoma rhodesiense* tends to follow a more acute course. Clinical features include:  
* Trypanosoma chancre \- painless subcutaneous nodule at site of infection
* intermittent fever
* enlargement of posterior cervical lymph nodes
* later: central nervous system involvement e.g. somnolence, headaches, mood changes, meningoencephalitis

  
Management  
* early disease: IV pentamidine or suramin
* later disease or central nervous system involvement: IV melarsoprol

  
**American trypanosomiasis**, or **Chagas' disease**, is caused by the protozoan *Trypanosoma cruzi*. The vast majority of patients (95%) are asymptomatic in the acute phase although a chagoma (an erythematous nodule at site of infection) and periorbital oedema are sometimes seen. Chronic Chagas' disease mainly affects the heart and gastrointestinal tract  
* myocarditis may lead to dilated cardiomyopathy (with apical atophy) and arrhythmias
* gastrointestinal features includes megaoesophagus and megacolon causing dysphagia and constipation

  
Management  
* treatment is most effective in the acute phase using azole or nitroderivatives such as benznidazole or nifurtimox
* chronic disease management involves treating the complications e.g., heart failure
