Schistosomiasis, or bilharzia, is a parasitic flatworm infection. The three main species of schistosome are *S. mansoni*, *S. japonicum* and *S. haematobium*.   
  
  
Acute infections
----------------

  
Acute symptoms typically only develop in people who travel to endemic areas, as they don't have any immunity to the worms.  
  
Acute manifestations may include:  
* swimmers' itch
* acute schistosomiasis syndrome (Katayama fever)
	+ fever
	+ urticaria/angioedema
	+ arthralgia/myalgia
	+ cough
	+ diarrhoea
	+ eosinophilia

  
  
Chronic infections
------------------

  
  
***Schistosoma haematobium***  
  
These worms deposit egg clusters (pseudopapillomas) in the bladder, causing inflammation. The calcification seen on x\-ray is actually calcification of the egg clusters, not the bladder itself.  
  
Depending on the site of these pseudopapillomas in the bladder, they can cause an obstructive uropathy and kidney damage.  
  
This typically presents as a 'swimmer's itch' in patients who have recently returned from Africa. Schistosoma haematobium is a risk factor for squamous cell bladder cancer.  
  
Features  
* frequency
* haematuria
* bladder calcification

  
Investigation  
* for asymptomatic patients serum schistosome antibodies are generally preferred
* for symptomatic patients the gold standard for diagnosis is urine or stool microscopy looking for eggs

  
Management  
* single oral dose of praziquantel

  
  
*Schistosoma mansoni* and *Schistosoma japonicum*
-------------------------------------------------

  
These worms mature in the liver and then travel through the portal system to inhabit the distal colon. Their presence in the portal system can lead to progressive hepatomegaly and splenomegaly due to portal vein congestion.  
  
These species can also lead to complications of liver cirrhosis, variceal disease and cor pulmonale.  
  
  
*Schistosoma intercalatum* and *Schistosoma mekongi*
----------------------------------------------------

  
These are less prevalent than the other three forms, but are both attributed to intestinal schistosomiasis.
