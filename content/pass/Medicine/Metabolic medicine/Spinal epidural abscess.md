A spinal epidural abscess (SEA) is a collection of pus that is superficial to the dura mater (of the meninges) that cover the spinal cord. It is an emergency requiring urgent investigation and treatment to avoid progressive spinal cord damage.  
  
An abscess is a collection of pus encapsulated by a pyogenic membrane.  
  
In SEA, bacteria enters the spinal epidural space by contiguous spread from adjacent structures (e.g. discitis), haematogenous spread from concomitant infection (e.g. bacteraemia from IVDU), or by direct infection (e.g. spinal surgery). Immunosuppression is another major risk factor, which may be caused by congenital immune disorders, acquired immune disorders (such as HIV, diabetes or alcoholism or by iatrogenic means (e.g. chemotherapy or steroids).   
  
SEA is most typically bacterial and the most common causative micro\-organism is  *Staphylococcus aureus.*   
  
Patients present with a combination:  
* fever
* back pain
* focal neurological deficits according to the segment of the cord affected.

  
Investigations  
* Bloods (including inflammatory markers, HIV, Hep B, Hep C, and preoperative blood tests (coagulation and group and screen))
* Blood cultures
* Infection screen (including chest x\-ray and urine culture)\*
* MRI whole spine (the entire spine is imaged since skip lesions may be present)

  
\*If the primary source of infection is not clear, a wide search for sources requires investigations including echocardiography and dental x\-rays.  
  
All patients will require a long\-term course of antibiotics which is at first broad spectrum but maybe later refined based on culture results. Patients with large or compressive abscesses, patients with significant or progressive neurological deficits or those who are not responding to antibiotics alone are considered for surgical evacuation of the abscess.
