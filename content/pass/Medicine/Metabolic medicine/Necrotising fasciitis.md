Necrotising fasciitis is a medical emergency that is difficult to recognise in the early stages.  
  
It can be classified according to the causative organism:  
* type 1 is caused by mixed anaerobes and aerobes (often occurs post\-surgery in diabetics). This is the most common type
* type 2 is caused by *Streptococcus pyogenes*

  
Risk factors  
* skin factors: recent trauma, burns or soft tissue infections
* diabetes mellitus
	+ the most common preexisting medical condition
	+ particularly if the patient is treated with SGLT\-2 inhibitors
* intravenous drug use
* immunosuppression

  
The most commonly affected site is the perineum (Fournier's gangrene).  
  
Features  
* acute onset
* pain, swelling, erythema at the affected site
	+ often presents as rapidly worsening cellulitis with pain out of keeping with physical features
	+ extremely tender over infected tissue with hypoaesthesia to light touch
	+ skin necrosis and crepitus/gas gangrene are late signs
* fever and tachycardia may be absent or occur late in the presentation

  
Management  
* urgent surgical referral debridement
* intravenous antibiotics

  
Prognosis  
* average mortality of 20%
