The tetanus vaccine is a cell\-free purified toxin that is normally given as part of a combined vaccine.  
  
Tetanus vaccine is currently given in the UK as part of the routine immunisation schedule at:  
* 2 months
* 3 months
* 4 months
* 3\-5 years
* 13\-18 years

  
This, therefore, provides 5 doses of tetanus\-containing vaccine. Five doses is now considered to provide adequate long\-term protection against tetanus.  
  
Management of wounds
--------------------

  
The Greenbook contains the full criteria. The information below is only an abbreviated summary:  
  
The first step is to classify the wound:  
  


| Clean wound | Tetanus prone wound | High\-risk tetanus prone wound |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Wounds less than 6 hours old, non\-penetrating with negligible tissue damage | * puncture\-type injuries acquired in a contaminated environment e.g. gardening injuries * wounds containing foreign bodies * compound fractures * wounds or burns with systemic sepsis * certain animal bites and scratches | - heavy contamination with material likely to contain tetanus spores e.g. soil, manure - wounds or burns that show extensive devitalised tissue - wounds or burns that require surgical intervention |

  
  
Patient has had a full course of tetanus vaccines, with the last dose \< 10 years ago  
* no vaccine nor tetanus immunoglobulin is required, regardless of the wound severity

  
Patient has had a full course of tetanus vaccines, with the last dose \> 10 years ago  
* if tetanus prone wound: reinforcing dose of vaccine
* high\-risk wounds (e.g. compound fractures, delayed surgical intervention, significant degree of devitalised tissue): reinforcing dose of vaccine \+ tetanus immunoglobulin

  
If vaccination history is incomplete or unknown  
* reinforcing dose of vaccine, regardless of the wound severity
* for tetanus prone and high\-risk wounds: reinforcing dose of vaccine \+ tetanus immunoglobulin
