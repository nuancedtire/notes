Hepatitis A  
* Human Normal Immunoglobulin (HNIG) or hepatitis A vaccine may be used depending on the clinical situation

  
Hepatitis B  
* HBsAg positive source
	+ if the person exposed is a known responder to the HBV vaccine then a booster dose should be given
	+ if they are a non\-responder (anti\-HBs \< 10mIU/ml 1\-2 months post\-immunisation) they need to have hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and a booster vaccine
* unknown source
	+ for known responders the HBV vaccine the Green Book advises considering a booster dose of HBV vaccine
	+ for known non\-responders HBIG \+ vaccine should be given whilst those in the process of being vaccinated should have an accelerated course of HBV vaccine

  
Hepatitis C  
* monthly PCR \- if seroconversion then interferon \+/\- ribavirin

  
HIV  
* the risk of HIV transmission depends heavily on the incident (e.g. needle stick, type of sexual intercourse, human bite etc) and the current viral load of the patient
* please see the BHIVA link for charts which outline the risk depending on the incident. Generally, low\-risk incidents such as human bites don't require post\-exposure prophylaxis
* a combination of oral antiretrovirals (e.g. Tenofovir, emtricitabine, lopinavir and ritonavir) as soon as possible (i.e. Within 1\-2 hours, but may be started up to 72 hours following exposure) for 4 weeks
* serological testing at 12 weeks following completion of post\-exposure prophylaxis
* reduces risk of transmission by 80%

  
Varicella zoster  
* VZIG for IgG negative pregnant women/immunosuppressed

  
Estimates of transmission risk for single needlestick injury

| Virus | Change of transmission |
| --- | --- |
| Hepatitis B | 20\-30% |
| Hepatitis C | 0\.5\-2% |
| HIV | 0\.3% |
