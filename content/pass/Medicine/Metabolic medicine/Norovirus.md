Norovirus, also known as the winter vomiting bug, is one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis in the UK according to NHS England. It is a genus that encompasses a range of non encapsulated RNA virus species. The CDC (Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) estimates that 1 in 5 cases of infectious gastroenteritis are caused by norovirus, with 685 million cases per year worldwide.   
  
Symptoms   
* Develop within 15 \- 50 hours of infection (quoted from the European Centre of Disease Control and Prevention), with patients experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, which may be accompanied by headaches, low\-grade fevers, and myalgia.
* The majority of patients experience both vomiting and diarrhoea
* 10 \- 22% reported a headache and up to 47% of patients reported fevers (Clinical Microbiology Reviews, Norovirus, January 2015\)

  
Transmission   
* Faecal\-oral route, with the virus becoming aerosolized when the patient vomits or when a toilet containing infected bodily fluids (vomit or faeces) is flushed.
* Viral particles are transmitted directly to surrounding potential hosts and to surrounding surfaces, from which they can be transmitted by cross\-contamination (for example a patient visitor touching the patient environment, then eating without first washing their hands).
* Infection may also be transmitted from an infected individual in the process of direct physical contact, or contact with food preparation.
* The virus enters the cell via host receptor\-mediated endocytosis and replicates in the small intestine. Norovirus is highly contagious, the European Centre of Disease Control and Prevention estimates that only 10 \- 100 viral particles are required to cause an active infection.
* Norovirus is not at present considered to be a notifiable disease in the UK.

  
Limiting transmission  
* Isolation of infected strongly recommended where possible, particularly in areas where the risk of person to person transmission is high, for example, in hospitals schools, and care facilities
* Good hand hygiene using soap and water is essential
* Alcohol hand gel has been shown to be less effective in reducing transmission

  
Diagnosis   
* Clinical history and stool culture viral PCR (polymerase chain reaction).

  
Differential diagnoses   
* Features most suggestive of norovirus include sudden onset vomiting, relatively short duration of symptoms and contact with others with similar symptoms.
* Rotavirus, *E. coli* and Salmonella infections will all cause similar clinical pictures, however, there are some important differentiating features.
* Salmonella infection has an incubation period of 6 \- 72 hours and is often the result of contact with contaminated animal products, for example, unpasteurized eggs or milk. Unlike norovirus, salmonella gastroenteritis can cause bloody diarrhoea and patients often have a high fever.
* Rotavirus gastroenteritis causes symptoms very similar to those of norovirus, but predominantly affects children under the age of 5 years.
* *E. coli* infection, like Norovirus, causes vomiting and diarrhoea but has a longer incubation period (between 3\-4 days but can be up to 10 days following pathogen exposure) and unlike Norovirus, E Coli infection commonly causes severe abdominal cramping and frequently causes bloody diarrhoea.

  
Resolution and Potential Complications  
* The infection is self\-limiting in immunocompetent patients and symptoms generally resolve within 72 hours
* Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances may arise as a result of vomiting and diarrhoea, leading to significant morbidity and mortality and patients should be managed supportively with rehydration and electrolyte supplementation where necessary.
