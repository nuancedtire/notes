| **Drug** | **Mechanism of action** | **Adverse effects** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Azoles | Inhibits 14Î±\-demethylase which produces ergosterol | P450 inhibitionLiver toxicity |  |
| Amphotericin B | Binds with ergosterol forming a transmembrane channel that leads to monovalent ion (K\+, Na\+, H\+ and Cl) leakage | Nephrotoxicity, flu\-like symptoms, hypokalaemia, hypomagnaseamia | Used for systemic fungal infections |
| Terbinafine | Inhibits squalene epoxidase |  | Commonly used in oral form to treat fungal nail infections |
| Griseofulvin | Interacts with microtubules to disrupt mitotic spindle | Induces P450 system, teratogenic |  |
| Flucytosine | Converted by cytosine deaminase to 5\-fluorouracil, which inhibits thymidylate synthase and disrupts fungal protein synthesis | Vomiting |  |
| Caspofungin | Inhibits synthesis of beta\-glucan, a major fungal cell wall component | Flushing |  |
| Nystatin | Binds with ergosterol forming a transmembrane channel that leads to monovalent ion (K\+, Na\+, H\+ and Cl) leakage |  | As very toxic can only be used topically (e.g. for oral thrush) |
