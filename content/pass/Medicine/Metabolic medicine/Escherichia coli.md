*Escherichia coli* is a facultative anaerobic, lactose\-fermenting, Gram negative rod which is a normal gut commensal.   
  
*E. coli* infections lead to a variety of diseases in humans including:  
* diarrhoeal illnesses
* UTIs
* neonatal meningitis

  
Serotypes
---------

  
*E. coli* may be classified according to the antigens which may trigger an immune response:  
  


| **Antigen** | **Origin** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| O | Lipopolysaccharide layer |  |
| K | Capsule | Neonatal meningitis secondary to *E. coli* is usually caused by a serotype that contains the capsular antigen K\-1 |
| H | Flagellin |  |

  
*E. coli* O157:H7 is a particular strain associated with severe, haemorrhagic, watery diarrhoea. It has a high mortality rate and can be complicated by haemolytic uraemic syndrome. It is often spread by contaminated ground beef.
