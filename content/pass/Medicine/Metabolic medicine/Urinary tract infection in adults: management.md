Lower urinary tract infections
------------------------------

  
Non\-pregnant women  
* local antibiotic guidelines should be followed if available
* NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries recommend **trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin** for **3 days**
* send a urine culture if:
	+ aged \> 65 years
	+ visible or non\-visible haematuria

  
Pregnant women   
* if the pregnant woman is symptomatic:
	+ a urine culture should be sent in all cases
	+ should be treated with an antibiotic for
	+ first\-line: nitrofurantoin (should be avoided near term)
	+ second\-line: amoxicillin or cefalexin
	+ trimethoprim is teratogenic in the first trimester and should be avoided during pregnancy
* asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women:
	+ a urine culture should be performed routinely at the first antenatal visit
	+ Clinical Knowledge Summaries recommend an immediate antibiotic prescription of either nitrofurantoin (should be avoided near term), amoxicillin or cefalexin. This should be a 7\-day course
	+ the rationale of treating asymptomatic bacteriuria is the significant risk of progression to acute pyelonephritis
	+ a further urine culture should be sent following completion of treatment as a test of cure

  
Men  
* an immediate antibiotic prescription should be offered for **7 days**
* as with non\-pregnant women, trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin should be offered first\-line unless prostatitis is suspected
* a urine culture should be sent in all cases before antibiotics are started
* NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries state: *'Referral to urology is not routinely required for men who have had one uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection (UTI).'*

  
Catherised patients  
* do not treat asymptomatic bacteria in catheterised patients
* if the patient is symptomatic they should be treated with an antibiotic
	+ a 7\-day, rather than a 3\-day course should be given
	+ consider removing or changing the catheter as soon as possible if it has been in place for longer than 7 days

   
  
Acute pyelonephritis
--------------------

  
For patients with sign of acute pyelonephritis hospital admission should be considered  
* local antibiotic guidelines should be followed if available
* the BNF currently recommends a broad\-spectrum cephalosporin or a quinolone (for non\-pregnant women) for 10\-14 days
