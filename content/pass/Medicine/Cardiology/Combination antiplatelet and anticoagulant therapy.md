With the increase in comorbidity, it is now common to find that a patient has an indication for both an antiplatelet (e.g. established cardiovascular disease) and an anticoagulant (e.g. atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism or valvular heart disease). However, combination therapy increases the risk of bleeding and may not be needed in all cases. How should this be managed?  
  
Whilst there are not guidelines to cover every scenario a recent review in the BMJ offered an expert opinion outlining the approach in common scenarios.  
  
Secondary prevention of stable cardiovascular disease with an indication for an anticoagulant  
* normally in this situation, all patients are recommended to be prescribed an antiplatelet
* if an indication for anticoagulant exists (for example atrial fibrillation) it is indicated that anticoagulant monotherapy is given without the addition of antiplatelets

  
Post\-acute coronary syndrome/percutaneous coronary intervention  
* in these patients, there is a much stronger indication for antiplatelet therapy
* generally patients are given triple therapy (2 antiplatelets \+ 1 anticoagulant) for 4 weeks\-6 months after the event and dual therapy (1 antiplatelet \+ 1 anticoagulant) to complete 12 months
* there is variation from patient to patient however given that the stroke risk in atrial fibrillation varies according to risk factors.

  
Venous thromboembolism (VTE)  
* if a patient on antiplatelets develops a VTE they are likely to be prescribed anticoagulants for 3\-6 months
* an ORBIT score should be calculated. Those with a low risk of bleeding may continue antiplatelets. In patients with an intermediate or high risk of bleeding consideration should be given to stopping the antiplatelets
