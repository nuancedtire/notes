Thiazide diuretics work by inhibiting sodium reabsorption at the beginning of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) by blocking the thiazide\-sensitive Na\+\-Clˆ’ symporter. Potassium is lost as a result of more sodium reaching the collecting ducts. Thiazide diuretics have a role in the treatment of mild heart failure although loop diuretics are better for reducing overload. The main use of bendroflumethiazide was in the management of hypertension but recent NICE guidelines now recommend other thiazide\-like diuretics such as indapamide and chlortalidone.  
  
Common adverse effects  
* dehydration
* postural hypotension
* hypokalaemia
	+ due to increased delivery of sodium to the distal part of the distal convoluted tubule → increased sodium reabsorption in exchange for potassium and hydrogen ions
* hyponatraemia
* hypercalcaemia
	+ the flip side of this is hypocalciuria, which may be useful in reducing the incidence of renal stones
* gout
* impaired glucose tolerance
* impotence

  
Rare adverse effects  
* thrombocytopaenia
* agranulocytosis
* photosensitivity rash
* pancreatitis
