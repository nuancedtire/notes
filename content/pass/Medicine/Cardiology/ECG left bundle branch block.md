New LBBB is always pathological. Causes of LBBB include:  
* myocardial infarction
	+ diagnosing a myocardial infarction for patients with *existing* LBBB is difficult
	+ rhe Sgarbossa criteria can help with this \- please see the link for more details
* hypertension
* aortic stenosis
* cardiomyopathy
* rare: idiopathic fibrosis, digoxin toxicity, hyperkalaemia
