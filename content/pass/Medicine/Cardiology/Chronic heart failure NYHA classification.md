The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification is widely used to classify the severity of heart failure:  
  
NYHA Class I  
* no symptoms
* no limitation: ordinary physical exercise does not cause undue fatigue, dyspnoea or palpitations

  
NYHA Class II  
* mild symptoms
* slight limitation of physical activity: comfortable at rest but ordinary activity results in fatigue, palpitations or dyspnoea

  
NYHA Class III  
* moderate symptoms
* marked limitation of physical activity: comfortable at rest but less than ordinary activity results in symptoms

  
NYHA Class IV  
* severe symptoms
* unable to carry out any physical activity without discomfort: symptoms of heart failure are present even at rest with increased discomfort with any physical activity
