Recommended treatments for all patients  
* IV loop diuretics
	+ e.g. furosemide or bumetanide

  
Possible additional treatments  
* oxygen
	+ this should be given in line with British Thoracic Society guidelines, i.e. keep oxygen saturations at 94\-98%
* vasodilators
	+ nitrates should not be routinely given to all patients
	+ they may, however, have a role if concomitant myocardial ischaemia, severe hypertension or regurgitant aortic or mitral valve disease
	+ the major side\-effect/contraindication is hypotension

Patients with respiratory failure  
* CPAP

  
Patients with hypotension (e.g. \< 85 mmHg)/cardiogenic shock  
* this can be a difficult scenario to manage
	+ some of the treatments typically used for acute heart failure (e.g. loop diuretics and nitrates) may exacerbate the hypotension
* inotropic agents
	+ e.g. dobutamine
	+ should be considered for patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction who have potentially reversible cardiogenic shock
* vasopressor agents
	+ e.g. norepinephrine
	+ normally only used if insufficient response to inotropes and evidence of end\-organ hypoperfusion
* mechanical circulatory assistance
	+ e.g. intra\-aortic balloon counterpulsation or ventricular assist devices

  
Other treatments  
* opiates
	+ NICE state 'do not routinely offer opiates to people with acute heart failure'
	+ they were previously used routinely and help to reduce dyspnoea/distress in patients
	+ however some studies have suggested increased morbidity in patients given opiates

  
General points  
* regular medication for heart failure such as beta\-blockers ACE\-inhibitors should be continued
	+ beta\-blockers should only be stopped if the patient has heart rate less than 50 beats per minute, second or third degree atrioventricular block, or shock
