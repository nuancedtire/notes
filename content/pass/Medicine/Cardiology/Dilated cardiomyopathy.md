Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common form of cardiomyopathy, accounting for 90% of cases.  
  
Causes:  
* idiopathic: the most common cause
* myocarditis: e.g. Coxsackie B, HIV, diphtheria, Chagas disease
* ischaemic heart disease
* peripartum
* hypertension
* iatrogenic: e.g. doxorubicin
* substance abuse: e.g. alcohol, cocaine
* inherited: either a familial genetic predisposition to DCM or a specific syndrome e.g. Duchenne muscular dystrophy
	+ around a third of patients with DCM are thought to have a genetic predisposition
	+ a large number of heterogeneous defects have been identified
	+ the majority of defects are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion although other patterns of inheritance are seen
* infiltrative e.g. haemochromatosis, sarcoidosis

 \+ these causes may also lead to restrictive cardiomyopathy  
* nutritional e.g. wet beriberi (thiamine deficiency)

  
Pathophysiology  
* dilated heart leading to predominately systolic dysfunction
* all 4 chambers are dilated, but the left ventricle more so than right ventricle
* eccentric hypertrophy (sarcomeres added in series) is seen

  
Features  
* classic findings of heart failure
* systolic murmur: stretching of the valves may result in mitral and tricuspid regurgitation
* S3
* 'balloon' appearance of the heart on the chest x\-ray
