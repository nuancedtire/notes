As well as providing information on right atrial pressure, the jugular vein waveform may provide clues to underlying valvular disease. A non\-pulsatile JVP is seen in superior vena caval obstruction. Kussmaul's sign describes a paradoxical rise in JVP during inspiration seen in constrictive pericarditis.

'a' wave \= atrial contraction  
* large if atrial pressure e.g. tricuspid stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary hypertension
* absent if in atrial fibrillation

  
Cannon 'a' waves  
* caused by atrial contractions against a closed tricuspid valve
* are seen in complete heart block, ventricular tachycardia/ectopics, nodal rhythm, single chamber ventricular pacing

  
'c' wave  
* closure of tricuspid valve
* not normally visible

  
'v' wave  
* due to passive filling of blood into the atrium against a closed tricuspid valve
* giant v waves in tricuspid regurgitation

  
'x' descent \= fall in atrial pressure during ventricular systole  
  
'y' descent \= opening of tricuspid valve
