Aortic regurgitation (AR) is the leaking of the aortic valve of the heart that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole.  
  
It can be caused either by disease of the aortic valve or by distortion or dilation of the aortic root and ascending aorta.  
  


|  | Causes of AR due to valve disease | Causes of AR due to aortic root disease |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chronic presentation** | * rheumatic fever: the most common cause in the developing world * calcific valve disease * connective tissue diseases e.g. rheumatoid arthritis/SLE * bicuspid aortic valve (affects both the valves and the aortic root) | - bicuspid aortic valve (affects both the valves and the aortic root) - spondylarthropathies (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis) - hypertension - syphilis - Marfan's, Ehler\-Danlos syndrome |
| **Acute presentation** | * infective endocarditis | - aortic dissection |

  
Features  
* early diastolic murmur: intensity of the murmur is increased by the handgrip manoeuvre
* collapsing pulse
* wide pulse pressure
* Quincke's sign (nailbed pulsation)
* De Musset's sign (head bobbing)
* mid\-diastolic Austin\-Flint murmur in severe AR \- due to partial closure of the anterior mitral valve cusps caused by the regurgitation streams

  
Suspected AR should be investigated with echocardiography.  
  
Management  
* medical management of any associated heart failure
* surgery: aortic valve indications include
	+ symptomatic patients with severe AR
	+ asymptomatic patients with severe AR who have LV systolic dysfunction
