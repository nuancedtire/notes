Wolff\-Parkinson White (WPW) syndrome is caused by a congenital accessory conducting pathway between the atria and ventricles leading to atrioventricular re\-entry tachycardia (AVRT). As the accessory pathway does not slow conduction AF can degenerate rapidly to VF.

Possible ECG features include:  
* short PR interval
* wide QRS complexes with a slurred upstroke \- 'delta wave'
* left axis deviation if right\-sided accessory pathway
	+ in the majority of cases, or in a question without qualification, Wolff\-Parkinson\-White syndrome is associated with left axis deviation
* right axis deviation if left\-sided accessory pathway

Differentiating between type A and type B  
* type A (left\-sided pathway): dominant R wave in V1
* type B (right\-sided pathway): no dominant R wave in V1

  
Associations of WPW  
* HOCM
* mitral valve prolapse
* Ebstein's anomaly
* thyrotoxicosis
* secundum ASD

  
Management  
* definitive treatment: radiofrequency ablation of the accessory pathway
* medical therapy: sotalol\*\*\*, amiodarone, flecainide
	+ sotalol should be avoided if there is coexistent atrial fibrillation as prolonging the refractory period at the AV node may increase the rate of transmission through the accessory pathway, increasing the ventricular rate and potentially deteriorating into ventricular fibrillation
