The first heart sound (S1\) is caused by closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves whilst the second heart sound (S2\) is due to aortic and pulmonary valve closure  
  
S1  
* closure of mitral and tricuspid valves
* soft if long PR or mitral regurgitation
* loud in mitral stenosis

  
S2  
* closure of aortic and pulmonary valves
* soft in aortic stenosis
* splitting during inspiration is normal

  
S3 (third heart sound)  
* caused by diastolic filling of the ventricle
* considered normal if \< 30 years old (may persist in women up to 50 years old)
* heard in left ventricular failure (e.g. dilated cardiomyopathy), constrictive pericarditis (called a pericardial knock) and mitral regurgitation

  
S4 (fourth heart sound)  
* may be heard in aortic stenosis, HOCM, hypertension
* caused by atrial contraction against a stiff ventricle
	+ therefore coincides with the P wave on ECG
* in HOCM a double apical impulse may be felt as a result of a palpable S4

  
Sites of auscultation
---------------------

  


| **Valve** | **Site** |
| --- | --- |
| Pulmonary valve | Left second intercostal space, at the upper sternal border |
| Aortic valve | Right second intercostal space, at the upper sternal border |
| Mitral valve | Left fifth intercostal space, just medial to mid clavicular line |
| Tricuspid valve | Left fourth intercostal space, at the lower left sternal border |

  
The diagram below demonstrates where the various cardiac valves are best heard.
