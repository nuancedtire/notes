Types of heart block
--------------------

  
First degree heart block  
* PR interval \> 0\.2 seconds

  
Second degree heart block  
* type 1 (Mobitz I, Wenckebach): progressive prolongation of the PR interval until a dropped beat occurs
* type 2 (Mobitz II): PR interval is constant but the P wave is often not followed by a QRS complex

  
Third degree (complete) heart block  
* there is no association between the P waves and QRS complexes
