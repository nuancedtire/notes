Classification
--------------

  
Stanford classification  
* type A \- ascending aorta, 2/3 of cases
* type B \- descending aorta, distal to left subclavian origin, 1/3 of cases

  
DeBakey classification  
* type I \- originates in ascending aorta, propagates to at least the aortic arch and possibly beyond it distally
* type II \- originates in and is confined to the ascending aorta
* type III \- originates in descending aorta, rarely extends proximally but will extend distally

  
Investigation
-------------

  
It's important to remember that patients may present acutely and be clinically unstable. The choice of investigations will have to take account of this.  
  
Chest x\-ray  
* widened mediastinum

  
CT angiography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis is the investigation of choice  
* suitable for stable patients and for planning surgery
* a false lumen is a key finding in diagnosing aortic dissection

  
Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE)  
* more suitable for unstable patients who are too risky to take to CT scanner

  
Management
----------

  
Type A  
* surgical management, but blood pressure should be controlled to a target systolic of 100\-120 mmHg whilst awaiting intervention

  
Type B\*  
* conservative management
* bed rest
* reduce blood pressure IV labetalol to prevent progression

  
Complications
-------------

  
Complications of backward tear  
* aortic incompetence/regurgitation
* MI: inferior pattern is often seen due to right coronary involvement

  
Complications of a forward tear  
* unequal arm pulses and BP
* stroke
* renal failure

\*endovascular repair of type B aortic dissection may have a role in the future
