Syncope may be defined as a transient loss of consciousness due to global cerebral hypoperfusion with rapid onset, short duration and spontaneous complete recovery. Note how this definition excludes other causes of collapse such as epilepsy.  
  
The European Society of Cardiology published guidelines in 2009 on the investigation and management of syncope. They suggested the following classification:  
  
Reflex syncope (neurally mediated)  
* vasovagal: triggered by emotion, pain or stress. Often referred to as 'fainting'
* situational: cough, micturition, gastrointestinal
* carotid sinus syncope

  
Orthostatic syncope  
* primary autonomic failure: Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia
* secondary autonomic failure: e.g. Diabetic neuropathy, amyloidosis, uraemia
* drug\-induced: diuretics, alcohol, vasodilators
* volume depletion: haemorrhage, diarrhoea

  
Cardiac syncope  
* arrhythmias: bradycardias (sinus node dysfunction, AV conduction disorders) or tachycardias (supraventricular, ventricular)
* structural: valvular, myocardial infarction, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
* others: pulmonary embolism

   
Reflex syncope is the most common cause in all age groups although orthostatic and cardiac causes become progressively more common in older patients.  
  
Evaluation  
* cardiovascular examination
* postural blood pressure readings: a symptomatic fall in systolic BP \> 20 mmHg or diastolic BP \> 10 mmHg or decrease in systolic BP \< 90 mmHg is considered diagnostic
* ECG for all patients
* other tests depend on clinical features
	+ patients with typical features, no postural drop and a normal ECG do not require further investigations
