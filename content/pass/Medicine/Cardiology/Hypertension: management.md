NICE published updated guidelines for the management of hypertension in 2019\. Some of the key changes include:  
* lowering the threshold for treating stage 1 hypertension in patients \< 80 years from 20% to 10%
* angiotensin receptor blockers can be used instead of ACE\-inhibitors where indicated
* if a patient is already taking an ACE\-inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, then a calcium channel blocker OR a thiazide\-like diuretic can be used. Previously only a calcium channel blocker was recommended

  
Blood pressure classification
-----------------------------

  
This becomes relevant later in some of the management decisions that NICE advocates.  
  


| **Stage** | **Criteria** |
| --- | --- |
| **Stage 1 hypertension** | Clinic BP \>\= 140/90 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP \>\= 135/85 mmHg |
| **Stage 2 hypertension** | Clinic BP \>\= 160/100 mmHg and subsequent ABPM daytime average or HBPM average BP \>\= 150/95 mmHg |
| **Severe hypertension** | Clinic systolic BP \>\= 180 mmHg, or clinic diastolic BP \>\= 120 mmHg |

Managing hypertension
---------------------

  
Lifestyle advice should not be forgotten and is frequently tested in exams:  
* a low salt diet is recommended, aiming for less than 6g/day, ideally 3g/day. The average adult in the UK consumes around 8\-12g/day of salt. A recent BMJ paper\* showed that lowering salt intake can have a significant effect on blood pressure. For example, reducing salt intake by 6g/day can lower systolic blood pressure by 10mmHg
* caffeine intake should be reduced
* the other general bits of advice remain: stop smoking, drink less alcohol, eat a balanced diet rich in fruit and vegetables, exercise more, lose weight

  
ABPM/HBPM \>\= 135/85 mmHg (i.e. stage 1 hypertension)  
* treat if \< 80 years of age AND any of the following apply; target organ damage, established cardiovascular disease, renal disease, diabetes or a 10\-year cardiovascular risk equivalent to 10% or greater
* in 2019, NICE made a further recommendation, suggesting that we should *'consider antihypertensive drug treatment in addition to lifestyle advice for adults aged under 60 with stage 1 hypertension and an estimated 10\-year risk below 10%. '*. This seems to be due to evidence that QRISK may underestimate the lifetime probability of developing cardiovascular disease

  
ABPM/HBPM \>\= 150/95 mmHg (i.e. stage 2 hypertension)  
* offer drug treatment regardless of age

  
For patients \< 40 years consider specialist referral to exclude secondary causes.

Flow chart showing the management of hypertension as per current NICE guideliness  
  
Step 1 treatment  
* patients \< 55\-years\-old or a background of type 2 diabetes mellitus: **A**CE inhibitor or a **A**ngiotensin receptor blocker (**A**CE\-i or **A**RB): **(A)**
	+ angiotensin receptor blockers should be used where ACE inhibitors are not tolerated (e.g. due to a cough)
* patients \>\= 55\-years\-old or of black African or African\-Caribbean origin: **C**alcium channel blocker **(C)**
	+ ACE inhibitors have reduced efficacy in patients of black African or African\-Caribbean origin are therefore not used first\-line

  
Step 2 treatment  
* if already taking an **A**CE\-i or **A**RB add a **C**alcium channel blocker or a thiazide\-like **D**iuretic
* if already taking a **C**alcium channel blocker add an **A**CE\-i or **A**RB or a thiazide\-like **D**iuretic
	+ for patients of black African or African\-Caribbean origin taking a calcium channel blocker for hypertension, if they require a second agent consider an angiotensin receptor blocker in preference to an ACE inhibitor
* **(A \+ C) or (A \+ D)** or **(C \+ A) or (C \+ D)**

  
Step 3 treatment  
* add a third drug to make, i.e.:
	+ if already taking an **(A \+ C)** then add a **D**
	+ if already **(A \+ D)** then add a **C**
* **(A \+ C \+ D)**

  
Step 4 treatment  
* NICE define step 4 as resistant hypertension and suggest either adding a 4th drug (as below) or seeking specialist advice
* first, check for:
	+ confirm elevated clinic BP with ABPM or HBPM
	+ assess for postural hypotension.
	+ discuss adherence
* if potassium \< 4\.5 mmol/l add low\-dose spironolactone
* if potassium \> 4\.5 mmol/l add an alpha\- or beta\-blocker

  
Patients who fail to respond to step 4 measures should be referred to a specialist. NICE recommend:  
 **If blood pressure remains uncontrolled with the optimal or maximum tolerated doses of four drugs, seek expert advice if it has not yet been obtained.**
