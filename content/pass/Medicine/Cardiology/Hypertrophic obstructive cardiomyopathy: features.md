Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is an autosomal dominant disorder of muscle tissue caused by defects in the genes encoding contractile proteins. The estimated prevalence is 1 in 500\. HOCM is important as it is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young.  
  
Pathophysiology  
* the most common defects involve a mutation in the gene encoding β\-myosin heavy chain protein or myosin\-binding protein C
* results in predominantly diastolic dysfunction
	+ left ventricle hypertrophy → decreased compliance → decreased cardiac output
* characterized by myofibrillar hypertrophy with chaotic and disorganized fashion myocytes ('disarray') and fibrosis on biopsy

  
Features  
* often asymptomatic
* exertional dyspnoea
* angina
* syncope
	+ typically following exercise
	+ due to subaortic hypertrophy of the ventricular septum, resulting in functional aortic stenosis
* sudden death (most commonly due to ventricular arrhythmias), arrhythmias, heart failure
* jerky pulse, large 'a' waves, double apex beat
* systolic murmurs
	+ ejection systolic murmur: due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Increases with Valsalva manoeuvre and decreases on squatting
	+ pansystolic murmur: due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve → mitral regurgitation

  
Associations  
* Friedreich's ataxia
* Wolff\-Parkinson White

  
Echo findings \- mnemonic \- MR SAM ASH  
* mitral regurgitation (MR)
* systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior mitral valve leaflet
* asymmetric hypertrophy (ASH)

  
ECG  
* left ventricular hypertrophy
* non\-specific ST segment and T\-wave abnormalities, progressive T wave inversion may be seen
* deep Q waves
* atrial fibrillation may occasionally be seen
