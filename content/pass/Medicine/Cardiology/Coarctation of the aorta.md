Coarctation of the aorta describes a congenital narrowing of the descending aorta. It is more common in males, despite an association with Turner's syndrome.  
  
Associations  
* Turner's syndrome
* bicuspid aortic valve
* berry aneurysms
* neurofibromatosis

  
Features  
* infancy: heart failure
* adult: hypertension
* radio\-femoral delay
* mid systolic murmur, maximal over the back
* apical click from the aortic valve
* notching of the inferior border of the ribs (due to collateral vessels) is not seen in young children
