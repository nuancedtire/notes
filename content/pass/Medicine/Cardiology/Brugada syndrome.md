Brugada syndrome is a form of inherited cardiovascular disease with may present with sudden cardiac death. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and has an estimated prevalence of 1:5,000\-10,000\. Brugada syndrome is more common in Asians.  
  
Pathophysiology  
* a large number of variants exist
* around 20\-40% of cases are caused by a mutation in the SCN5A gene which encodes the myocardial sodium ion channel protein

  
ECG changes  
* convex ST segment elevation \> 2mm in \> 1 of V1\-V3 followed by a negative T wave
* partial right bundle branch block
* the ECG changes may be more apparent following the administration of flecainide or ajmaline \- this is the investigation of choice in suspected cases of Brugada syndrome

  
Management  
* implantable cardioverter\-defibrillator
