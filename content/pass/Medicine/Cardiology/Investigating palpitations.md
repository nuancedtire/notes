Palpitations are a common presenting symptom.   
  
Possible causes include  
* arrhythmias
* stress
* increased awareness of normal heart beat / extrasystoles

  
First\-line investigations include:  
* 12\-lead ECG: this will only capture the heart rhythm for a few seconds and hence is likely to miss episodic arrhythmias. However, other abnormalities linked to the underlying arrhythmia (for example a prolonged QT interval or PR interval, or changes suggesting recent myocardial ischaemia) may be seen.
* thyroid function tests: thyrotoxicosis may precipitate atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias
* urea and electrolytes: looking for disturbances such as a low potassium
* full blood count

  
Capturing episodic arrhythmias
------------------------------

  
First\-line investigations are often normal in patients complaining of palpitations. The next step is to exclude an episode arrhythmia.  
  
The most common investigation is Holter monitoring  
* portable battery operated device
* continuously records ECG from 2\-3 leads
* usually done for 24 hours but may be used for longer if symptoms are less than daily
* patients are asked to keep a diary to record any symptomatic palpitations. This can later be compared to the rhythm strip at the time of the symptoms
* at the end of the monitoring a report is generated summarising a number of parameters including heart rate, arrhythmias and changes in ECG waveform

  
If no abnormality is found on the Holter monitor, and symptoms continue, other options include:  
* external loop recorder
* implantable loop recorder
