NICE issued updated guidelines on management in 2018, key points are summarised here.  
  
Whilst loop diuretics play an important role in managing fluid overload it should be remembered that no long\-term reduction in mortality has been demonstrated for loop diuretics such as furosemide.  
  
First\-line therapy
-------------------

  
The first\-line treatment for all patients is both an **ACE\-inhibitor** and a **beta\-blocker**  
* generally, one drug should be started at a time. NICE advise that clinical judgement is used when determining which one to start first
* beta\-blockers licensed to treat heart failure in the UK include bisoprolol, carvedilol, and nebivolol.
* ACE\-inhibitors and beta\-blockers have no effect on mortality in heart failure with *preserved* ejection fraction

  
Second\-line therapy
--------------------

  
The standard second\-line treatment is an **aldosterone antagonist**  
* these are sometimes referred to as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Examples include spironolactone and eplerenone
* it should be remembered that both ACE inhibitors (which the patient is likely to already be on) and aldosterone antagonists both cause hyperkalaemia \- therefore potassium should be monitored

  
There is an increasing role for **SGLT\-2 inhibitors** in the management of heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction  
* these drugs reduce glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion
* examples include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin
* the evidence base shows SGLT\-2 inhibitors reduced hospitalisation secondary to heart failure and cardiovascular death
* international guidelines widely recommend their usage. In terms of NICE, a technology appraisal from 2021 support the use of dapagliflozin as an add\-on to optimised standard care

  
Third\-line therapy
-------------------

  
Third\-line treatment should be initiated by a specialist. Options include ivabradine, sacubitril\-valsartan, hydralazine in combination with nitrate, digoxin and cardiac resynchronisation therapy  
* ivabradine
	+ criteria: sinus rhythm \> 75/min and a left ventricular fraction \< 35%
* sacubitril\-valsartan
	+ criteria: left ventricular fraction \< 35%
	+ is considered in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction who are symptomatic on ACE inhibitors or ARBs
	+ should be initiated following ACEi or ARB wash\-out period
* digoxin
	+ digoxin has also not been proven to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure. It may however improve symptoms due to its inotropic properties
	+ it is strongly indicated if there is coexistent atrial fibrillation
* hydralazine in combination with nitrate
	+ this may be particularly indicated in Afro\-Caribbean patients
* cardiac resynchronisation therapy
	+ indications include a widened QRS (e.g. left bundle branch block) complex on ECG

  
Other treatments  
* offer **annual influenza vaccine**
* offer one\-off **pneumococcal vaccine**
	+ adults usually require just one dose but those with asplenia, splenic dysfunction or chronic kidney disease need a booster every 5 years
