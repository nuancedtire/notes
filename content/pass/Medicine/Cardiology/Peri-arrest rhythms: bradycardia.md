The 2021 Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines emphasise that the management of bradycardia depends on:  
* 1\. identifying the presence of signs indicating haemodynamic compromise \- 'adverse signs'
* 2\. identifying the potential risk of asystole

  
Adverse signs
-------------

  
The following factors indicate haemodynamic compromise and hence the need for treatment:  
* shock: hypotension (systolic blood pressure \< 90 mmHg), pallor, sweating, cold, clammy extremities, confusion or impaired consciousness
* syncope
* myocardial ischaemia
* heart failure

  
Atropine (500mcg IV) is the first line treatment in this situation.  
  
If there is an unsatisfactory response the following interventions may be used:  
* atropine, up to a maximum of 3mg
* transcutaneous pacing
* isoprenaline/adrenaline infusion titrated to response

  
Specialist help should be sought for consideration of transvenous pacing if there is no response to the above measures.

Potential risk of asystole
--------------------------

  
The following are risk factors for asystole. Even if there is a satisfactory response to atropine specialist help is indicated to consider the need for transvenous pacing:  
* complete heart block with broad complex QRS
* recent asystole
* Mobitz type II AV block
* ventricular pause \> 3 seconds
