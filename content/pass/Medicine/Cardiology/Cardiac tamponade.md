Cardiac tamponade is characterized by the accumulation of pericardial fluid under pressure.   
  
Classical features \- Beck's triad:  
* hypotension
* raised JVP
* muffled heart sounds

  
Other features:  
* dyspnoea
* tachycardia
* an absent Y descent on the JVP \- this is due to the limited right ventricular filling
* pulsus paradoxus \- an abnormally large drop in BP during inspiration
* Kussmaul's sign \- much debate about this
* ECG: electrical alternans

  
The key differences between constrictive pericarditis and cardiac tamponade are summarised in the table below:  
  


|  | **Cardiac tamponade** | **Constrictive pericarditis** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **JVP** | Absent Y descent | X \+ Y present |
| **Pulsus paradoxus** | Present | Absent |
| **Kussmaul's sign** | Rare | Present |
| **Characteristic features** |  | Pericardial calcification on CXR |

  
A commonly used mnemonic to remember the absent Y descent in cardiac tamponade is TAMponade \= TAMpaX  
  
Management  
* urgent pericardiocentesis

An ECG demonstrating electrical alternans. Note the alternation of QRS complex amplitude between beats.
