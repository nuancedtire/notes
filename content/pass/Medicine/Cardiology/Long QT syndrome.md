Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited condition associated with delayed repolarization of the ventricles. It is important to recognise as it may lead to ventricular tachycardia/torsade de pointes and can therefore cause collapse/sudden death. The most common variants of LQTS (LQT1 \& LQT2\) are caused by defects in the alpha subunit of the slow delayed rectifier potassium channel. A normal corrected QT interval is less than 430 ms in males and 450 ms in females.  
  
Causes of a prolonged QT interval:  
  


| **Congenital** | **Drugs\*** | **Other** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| * Jervell\-Lange\-Nielsen syndrome (includes deafness and is due to an abnormal potassium channel) * Romano\-Ward syndrome (no deafness) | - amiodarone, sotalol, class 1a antiarrhythmic drugs - tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (especially citalopram) - methadone - chloroquine - terfenadine\*\* - erythromycin - haloperidol - ondanestron | - electrolyte: hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia - acute myocardial infarction - myocarditis - hypothermia - subarachnoid haemorrhage |

  
Features  
* may be picked up on routine ECG or following family screening
* Long QT1 \- usually associated with exertional syncope, often swimming
* Long QT2 \- often associated with syncope occurring following emotional stress, exercise or auditory stimuli
* Long QT3 \- events often occur at night or at rest
* sudden cardiac death

  
Management  
* avoid drugs which prolong the QT interval and other precipitants if appropriate (e.g. Strenuous exercise)
* beta\-blockers\*\*\*
* implantable cardioverter defibrillators in high risk cases

  
\*the usual mechanism by which drugs prolong the QT interval is blockage of potassium channels. See the link for more details  
  
\*\*a non\-sedating antihistamine and classic cause of prolonged QT in a patient, especially if also taking P450 enzyme inhibitor, e.g. Patient with a cold takes terfenadine and erythromycin at the same time  
  
\*\*\*note sotalol may exacerbate long QT syndrome
