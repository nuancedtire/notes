NICE issued updated guidelines on diagnosis and management in 2018\. Previously the first\-line investigation was determined by whether the patient has previously had a myocardial infarction or not this is no longer the case \- all patients should have an N\-terminal pro\-B\-type natriuretic peptide (NT\-proBNP) blood test first\-line.  
  
Interpreting the test  
* if levels are 'high' arrange specialist assessment (including transthoracic echocardiography) within 2 weeks
* if levels are 'raised' arrange specialist assessment (including transthoracic echocardiography) echocardiogram within 6 weeks

  
Serum natriuretic peptides
--------------------------

  
B\-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a hormone produced mainly by the left ventricular myocardium in response to strain. Very high levels are associated with a poor prognosis.  
  


|  | **BNP** | **NTproBNP** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **High levels** | \> 400 pg/ml (116 pmol/litre) | \> 2000 pg/ml (236 pmol/litre) |
| **Raised levels** | 100\-400 pg/ml (29\-116 pmol/litre) | 400\-2000 pg/ml (47\-236 pmol/litre) |
| **Normal levels** | \< 100 pg/ml (29 pmol/litre) | \< 400 pg/ml (47 pmol/litre) |

  
Factors which alter the BNP level:  
  


| **Increase BNP levels** | **Decrease BNP levels** |
