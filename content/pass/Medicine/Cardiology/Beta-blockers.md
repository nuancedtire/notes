Beta\-blockers are an important class of drug used mainly in the management of cardiovascular disorders.  
  
Indications  
* angina
* post\-myocardial infarction
* heart failure: beta\-blockers were previously avoided in heart failure but there is now strong evidence that certain beta\-blockers improve both symptoms and mortality
* arrhythmias: beta\-blockers have now replaced digoxin as the rate\-control drug of choice in atrial fibrillation
* hypertension: the role of beta\-blockers has diminished in recent years due to a lack of evidence in terms of reducing stroke and myocardial infarction.
* thyrotoxicosis
* migraine prophylaxis
* anxiety

  
Examples  
* atenolol
* propranolol: one of the first beta\-blockers to be developed. Lipid soluble therefore crosses the blood\-brain barrier

  
Side\-effects  
* bronchospasm
* cold peripheries
* fatigue
* sleep disturbances, including nightmares
* erectile dysfunction

  
Contraindications  
* uncontrolled heart failure
* asthma
* sick sinus syndrome
* concurrent verapamil use: may precipitate severe bradycardia
