Angiotensin II receptor blockers are generally used in situations where patients have not tolerated an ACE inhibitor, usually due to the development of a cough.  
  
Examples  
* candesartan
* losartan
* irbesartan

  
Like ACE inhibitors they should be used with caution in patients with renovascular disease. Side\-effects include hypotension and hyperkalaemia.  
  
Mechanism  
* block effects of angiotensin II at the AT1 receptor

  
Evidence base  
* shown to reduce progression of renal disease in patients with diabetic nephropathy
* evidence base that losartan reduces CVA and IHD mortality in hypertensive patients
