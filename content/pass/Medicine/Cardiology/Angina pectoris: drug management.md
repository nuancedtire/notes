The management of stable angina comprises lifestyle changes, medication, percutaneous coronary intervention and surgery. NICE produced guidelines in 2011 covering the management of stable angina  
  
Medication  
* all patients should receive aspirin and a statin in the absence of any contraindication
* sublingual glyceryl trinitrate to abort angina attacks
* NICE recommend using either a beta\-blocker or a calcium channel blocker first\-line based on 'comorbidities, contraindications and the person's preference'
* if a calcium channel blocker is used as monotherapy a rate\-limiting one such as verapamil or diltiazem should be used
* if used in combination with a beta\-blocker then use a longer\-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (e.g. amlodipine, modified\-release nifedipine)
	+ remember that beta\-blockers should not be prescribed concurrently with verapamil (risk of complete heart block)
* if there is a poor response to initial treatment then medication should be increased to the maximum tolerated dose (e.g. for atenolol 100mg od)
* if a patient is still symptomatic after monotherapy with a beta\-blocker add a calcium channel blocker and vice versa
* if a patient is on monotherapy and cannot tolerate the addition of a calcium channel blocker or a beta\-blocker then consider one of the following drugs:
	+ a long\-acting nitrate
	+ ivabradine
	+ nicorandil
	+ ranolazine
* if a patient is taking both a beta\-blocker and a calcium\-channel blocker then only add a third drug whilst a patient is awaiting assessment for PCI or CABG

  
Nitrate tolerance  
* many patients who take nitrates develop tolerance and experience reduced efficacy
* NICE advises that patients who take standard\-release isosorbide mononitrate should use an asymmetric dosing interval to maintain a daily nitrate\-free time of 10\-14 hours to minimise the development of nitrate tolerance
* this effect is not seen in patients who take once\-daily modified\-release isosorbide mononitrate
