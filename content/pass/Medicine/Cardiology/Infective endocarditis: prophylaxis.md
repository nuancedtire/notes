The 2008 guidelines from NICE have radically changed the list of procedures for which antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended  
  
NICE recommends the following procedures do not require prophylaxis:  
* dental procedures
* upper and lower gastrointestinal tract procedures
* genitourinary tract; this includes urological, gynaecological and obstetric procedures and childbirth
* upper and lower respiratory tract; this includes ear, nose and throat procedures and bronchoscopy

  
The guidelines do however suggest:  
* any episodes of infection in people at risk of infective endocarditis should be investigated and treated promptly to reduce the risk of endocarditis developing
* if a person at risk of infective endocarditis is receiving antimicrobial therapy because they are undergoing a gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedure at a site where there is a suspected infection they should be given an antibiotic that covers organisms that cause infective endocarditis

  
It is important to note that these recommendations are not in keeping with the American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology guidelines which still advocate antibiotic prophylaxis for high\-risk patients who are undergoing dental procedures.
