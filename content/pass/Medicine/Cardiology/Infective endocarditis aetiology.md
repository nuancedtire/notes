The strongest risk factor for developing infective endocarditis is a previous episode of endocarditis. The following types of patients are affected:  
* previously normal valves (50%, typically acute presentation)
	+ the mitral valve is most commonly affected
* rheumatic valve disease (30%)
* prosthetic valves
* congenital heart defects
* intravenous drug users (IVDUs)
	+ e.g. typically causing tricuspid lesion)
* others: recent piercings

  
Causes  
* *Staphylococcus aureus*
	+ now the most common cause of infective endocarditis
	+ particularly common in acute presentation and IVDUs
* *Streptococcus viridans*
	+ historically *Streptococcus viridans* was the most common cause of infective endocarditis. This is no longer the case, except in developing countries
	+ technically *Streptococcus viridans* is a pseudotaxonomic term, referring to viridans streptococci, rather than a particular organism. The two most notable viridans streptococci are *Streptococcus mitis* and *Streptococcus sanguinis*
	+ they are both commonly found in the mouth and in particular dental plaque so endocarditis caused by these organisms is linked with poor dental hygiene or following a dental procedure
* coagulase\-negative Staphylococci such as *Staphylococcus epidermidis*
	+ commonly colonize indwelling lines and are the most cause of endocarditis in patients following prosthetic valve surgery, usually the result of perioperative contamination.
	+ after 2 months the spectrum of organisms which cause endocarditis return to normal (i.e. *Staphylococcus aureus* is the most common cause)
* *Streptococcus bovis*
	+ associated with colorectal cancer
	+ the subtype *Streptococcus gallolyticus* is most linked with colorectal cancer
* non\-infective
	+ systemic lupus erythematosus (Libman\-Sacks)
	+ malignancy: marantic endocarditis

  
Culture negative causes  
* prior antibiotic therapy
* *Coxiella burnetii*
* *Bartonella*
* *Brucella*
* HACEK: *Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella*)
