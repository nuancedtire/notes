Ejection systolic  
* louder on expiration
	+ aortic stenosis
	+ hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
* louder on inspiration
	+ pulmonary stenosis
	+ atrial septal defect
* also: tetralogy of Fallot

  
Holosystolic (pansystolic)  
* mitral/tricuspid regurgitation (high\-pitched and 'blowing' in character)
	+ tricuspid regurgitation becomes louder during inspiration, unlike mitral reguritation
	+ during inspiration, the venous blood flow into the right atrium and ventricle are increased → increases the stroke volume of the right ventricle during systole
* ventricular septal defect ('harsh' in character)

  
Late systolic  
* mitral valve prolapse
* coarctation of aorta

  
Early diastolic  
* aortic regurgitation (high\-pitched and 'blowing' in character)
* Graham\-Steel murmur (pulmonary regurgitation, again high\-pitched and 'blowing' in character)

  
Mid\-late diastolic  
* mitral stenosis ('rumbling' in character)
* Austin\-Flint murmur (severe aortic regurgitation, again is 'rumbling' in character)

  
Continuous machine\-like murmur  
* patent ductus arteriosus

  
RILE  
**R**ight\-sided murmur → heard best on **I**nspiration  
**L**eft\-sided murmur → heard best on **E**xpiration
