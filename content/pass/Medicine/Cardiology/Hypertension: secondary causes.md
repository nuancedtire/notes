It is thought that between 5\-10% of patients diagnosed with hypertension have **primary hyperaldosteronism**, including Conn's syndrome. This makes it the single most common cause of secondary hypertension.  
  
Renal disease accounts for a large percentage of the other cases of secondary hypertension. Conditions which may increase the blood pressure include:  
* glomerulonephritis
* pyelonephritis
* adult polycystic kidney disease
* renal artery stenosis

  
Endocrine disorders (other than primary hyperaldosteronism) may also result in increased blood pressure:  
* phaeochromocytoma
* Cushing's syndrome
* Liddle's syndrome
* congenital adrenal hyperplasia (11\-beta hydroxylase deficiency)
* acromegaly

  
Drug causes:  
* steroids
* monoamine oxidase inhibitors
* the combined oral contraceptive pill
* NSAIDs
* leflunomide

  
Other causes include:  
* pregnancy
* coarctation of the aorta
