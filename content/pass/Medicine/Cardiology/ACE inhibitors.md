Angiotensin\-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are now the established first\-line treatment in younger patients with hypertension and are also extensively used to treat heart failure. They are known to be less effective in treating hypertensive Afro\-Caribbean patients. ACE inhibitors are also used to treat diabetic nephropathy and have a role in the secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease.  
  
Mechanism of action:  
* inhibits the conversion angiotensin I to angiotensin II
	+ → decrease in angiotensin II levels → to vasodilation and reduced blood pressure
	+ → decrease in angiotensin II levels → reduced stimulation for aldosterone release → decrease in sodium and water retention by the kidneys
* renoprotective mechanism
	+ angiotensin II constricts the efferent glomerular arterioles
	+ ACE inhibitors therefore lead to dilation of the efferent arterioles → reduced glomerular capillary pressure → decreased mechanical stress on the delicate filtration barriers of the glomeruli
	+ this is particularly important in diabetic nephropathy
* ACE inhibitors are activated by phase 1 metabolism in the liver

  
Side\-effects:  
* cough
	+ occurs in around 15% of patients and may occur up to a year after starting treatment
	+ thought to be due to increased bradykinin levels
* angioedema: may occur up to a year after starting treatment
* hyperkalaemia
* first\-dose hypotension: more common in patients taking diuretics

  
Cautions and contraindications  
* pregnancy and breastfeeding \- avoid
* renovascular disease \- may result in renal impairment
* aortic stenosis \- may result in hypotension
* hereditary of idiopathic angioedema
* specialist advice should be sought before starting ACE inhibitors in patients with a potassium \>\= 5\.0 mmol/L

  
Interactions  
* patients receiving high\-dose diuretic therapy (more than 80 mg of furosemide a day)
	+ significantly increases the risk of hypotension

  
Monitoring  
* urea and electrolytes should be checked before treatment is initiated and after increasing the dose
	+ a rise in the creatinine and potassium may be expected after starting ACE inhibitors
	+ acceptable changes are an increase in serum creatinine, up to 30% from baseline and an increase in potassium up to 5\.5 mmol/l.
	+ significant renal impairment may occur in patients who have undiagnosed bilateral renal artery stenosis

  
Examples of common ACE inhibitors  
* ramipril
* enalapril
* lisinopril
