Aortic dissection is a rare but serious cause of chest pain.   
  
Pathophysiology  
* tear in the tunica intima of the wall of the aorta

  
Associations  
* hypertension: the most important risk factor
* trauma
* bicuspid aortic valve
* collagens: Marfan's syndrome, Ehlers\-Danlos syndrome
* Turner's and Noonan's syndrome
* pregnancy
* syphilis

  
Features:  
* chest/back pain
	+ typically severe and 'sharp', 'tearing' in nature
	+ pain is typically maximal at onset
	+ classically chest pain is more common in type A dissection and upper back pain is more common in type B dissection. However, there is considerable overlap and both chest and back pain are present in many patients
* pulse deficit
	+ weak or absent carotid, brachial, or femoral pulse
	+ variation (\>20 mmHg) in systolic blood pressure between the arms
* aortic regurgitation
* hypertension
* other features may result from the involvement of specific arteries. For example:
	+ coronary arteries → angina
	+ spinal arteries → paraplegia
	+ distal aorta → limb ischaemia
* the majority of patients have no or non\-specific ECG changes. In a minority of patients, ST\-segment elevation may be seen in the inferior leads

  
Classification
--------------

  
Stanford classification  
* type A \- ascending aorta, 2/3 of cases
* type B \- descending aorta, distal to left subclavian origin, 1/3 of cases

  
DeBakey classification  
* type I \- originates in ascending aorta, propagates to at least the aortic arch and possibly beyond it distally
* type II \- originates in and is confined to the ascending aorta
* type III \- originates in descending aorta, rarely extends proximally but will extend distally
