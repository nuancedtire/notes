Acute pericarditis is a condition referring to inflammation of the pericardial sac, lasting for less than 4\-6 weeks.  
  
Aetiology  
* viral infections (Coxsackie)
* tuberculosis
* uraemia
* post\-myocardial infarction
	+ early (1\-3 days): fibrinous pericarditis
	+ late (weeks to months): autoimmune pericarditis (Dressler's syndrome)
* radiotherapy
* connective tissue disease
	+ systemic lupus erythematosus
	+ rheumatoid arthritis
* hypothyroidism
* malignancy
	+ lung cancer
	+ breast cancer
* trauma

  
Features  
* chest pain: may be pleuritic. Is often relieved by sitting forwards
* other symptoms include a non\-productive cough, dyspnoea and flu\-like symptoms
* pericardial rub

  
Investigations  
* ECG changes
	+ the changes in pericarditis are often global/widespread, as opposed to the 'territories' seen in ischaemic events
	+ 'saddle\-shaped' ST elevation
	+ PR depression: most specific ECG marker for pericarditis
* all patients with suspected acute pericarditis should have transthoracic echocardiography
* bloods
	+ inflammatory markers
	+ troponin: around 30% of patients may have an elevated troponin \- this indicates possible myopericarditis

Management  
* the majority of patients can be managed as outpatients
	+ patients who have high\-risk features such as fever \> 38Â°C or elevated troponin should be managed as an inpatient
* treat any underlying cause
	+ most patients however will have pericarditis secondary to viral infection, meaning no specific treatment is indicated
* strenuous physical activity should be avoided until symptom resolution and normalisation of inflammatory markers
* a combination of NSAIDs and colchicine is now generally used for first\-line for patients with acute idiopathic or viral pericarditis
	+ until symptom resolution and normalisation of inflammatory markers (usually 1\-2 weeks) followed by tapering of dose recommended over
