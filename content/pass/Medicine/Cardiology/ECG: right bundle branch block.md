One of the most common ways to remember the difference between LBBB and RBBB is WiLLiaM MaRRoW   
* in LBBB there is a 'W' in V1 and a 'M' in V6
* in RBBB there is a 'M' in V1 and a 'W' in V6

Causes of RBBB  
* normal variant \- more common with increasing age
* right ventricular hypertrophy
* chronically increased right ventricular pressure \- e.g. cor pulmonale
* pulmonary embolism
* myocardial infarction
* atrial septal defect (ostium secundum)
* cardiomyopathy or myocarditis
