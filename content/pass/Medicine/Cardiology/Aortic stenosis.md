Clinical features of symptomatic disease  
* chest pain
* dyspnoea
* syncope / presyncope (e.g. exertional dizziness)
* murmur
	+ an **ejection systolic murmur** (ESM) is classically seen in aortic stenosis
	+ classically radiates to the carotids
	+ this is decreased following the Valsalva manoeuvre

  
Features of severe aortic stenosis  
* narrow pulse pressure
* slow rising pulse
* delayed ESM
* soft/absent S2
* S4
* thrill
* duration of murmur
* left ventricular hypertrophy or failure

  
Causes of aortic stenosis  
* degenerative calcification (most common cause in older patients \> 65 years)
* bicuspid aortic valve (most common cause in younger patients \< 65 years)
* William's syndrome (supravalvular aortic stenosis)
* post\-rheumatic disease
* subvalvular: HOCM

  
Management  
* if asymptomatic then observe the patient is a general rule
* if symptomatic then valve replacement
* if asymptomatic but valvular gradient \> 40 mmHg and with features such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction then consider surgery
* options for aortic valve replacement (AVR) include:
	+ surgical AVR is the treatment of choice for young, low/medium operative risk patients. Cardiovascular disease may coexist. For this reason, an angiogram is often done prior to surgery so that the procedures can be combined
	+ transcatheter AVR (TAVR) is used for patients with a high operative risk
* balloon valvuloplasty
	+ may be used in children with no aortic valve calcification
	+ in adults limited to patients with critical aortic stenosis who are not fit for valve replacement
