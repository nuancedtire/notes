Furosemide and bumetanide are loop diuretics that act by inhibiting the Na\-K\-Cl cotransporter (NKCC) in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, reducing the absorption of NaCl. There are two variants of NKCC; loop diuretics act on NKCC2, which is more prevalent in the kidneys.  
  
As loop diuretics work on the apical membrane they must first be filtered into the tubules by the glomerulus before they can have an effect. Therefore patients with poor renal function may require escalating doses to ensure a sufficient concentration is achieved within the tubules.  
  
Indications  
* heart failure: both acute (usually intravenously) and chronic (usually orally)
* resistant hypertension, particularly in patients with renal impairment

  
Adverse effects  
* hypotension
* hyponatraemia
* hypokalaemia, hypomagnesaemia
* hypochloraemic alkalosis
* ototoxicity
* hypocalcaemia
* renal impairment (from dehydration \+ direct toxic effect)
* hyperglycaemia (less common than with thiazides)
* gout
