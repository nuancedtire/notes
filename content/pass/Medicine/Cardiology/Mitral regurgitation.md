Also known as mitral insufficiency, mitral regurgitation (MR) occurs when blood leaks back through the mitral valve on systole. It is the second most common valve disease after aortic stenosis. The mitral valve is located between the left atrium and ventricle, and regurgitation leads to a less efficient heart as less blood is pumped through the body with each contraction. This said, MR is common in otherwise healthy patients to a trivial degree and does not need treatment.   
  
As the degree of regurgitation becomes more severe, the body's oxygen demands may exceed what the heart can supply and as a result, the myocardium can thicken over time. While this may be benign initially, patients may find themselves increasingly fatigued as a thicker myocardium becomes less efficient, and eventually go into irreversible heart failure.  
  
Risk factors  
* Female sex
* Lower body mass
* Age
* Renal dysfunction
* Prior myocardial infarction
* Prior mitral stenosis or valve prolapse
* Collagen disorders e.g. Marfan's Syndrome and Ehlers\-Danlos syndrome

  
Causes  
* Following coronary artery disease or post\-MI: if the papillary muscles or chordae tendinae are affected by a cardiac insult, mitral valve disease may ensue as a result of damage to its supporting structures.
* Mitral valve prolapse: Occurs when the leaflets of the mitral valve is deformed so the valve does not close properly and allows for backflow. Most patients with this have a trivial degree of mitral regurgitation.
* Infective endocarditis: When vegetations from the organisms colonising the heart grow on the mitral valve, it is prevented from closing properly. Patients with abnormal valves are more likely to develop endocarditis as opposed to their peers.
* Rheumatic fever: While this is uncommon in developed countries, rheumatic fever can cause inflammation of the valves and therefore result in mitral regurgitation.
* Congenital

  
Symptoms  
* Most patients with MR are asymptomatic, and patients suffering from mild to moderate MR may stay largely asymptomatic indefinitely. Symptoms tend to be due to failure of the left ventricle, arrhythmias or pulmonary hypertension. This may present as fatigue, shortness of breath and oedema.

  
Signs  
* The murmur heard on auscultation of the chest is typically a pansystolic murmur described as 'blowing'. It is heard best at the apex and radiating into the axilla. S1 may be quiet as a result of incomplete closure of the valve. Severe MR may cause a widely split S2

   
Investigations  
* ECG may show a broad P wave, indicative of atrial enlargement
* Cardiomegaly may be seen on chest x\-ray, with an enlarged left atrium and ventricle
* Echocardiography is crucial to diagnosis and to assess severity

  
Treatment options  
* Medical management in acute cases involves nitrates, diuretics, positive inotropes and an intra\-aortic balloon pump to increase cardiac output
* If patients are in heart failure, ACE inhibitors may be considered along with beta\-blockers and spironolactone
* In acute, severe regurgitation, surgery is indicated
* The evidence for repair over replacement is strong in degenerative regurgitation, and is demonstrated through lower mortality and higher survival rates
* When this is not possible, valve replacement with either an artificial valve or a pig valve is considered
