Whilst strictly speaking the term supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) refers to any tachycardia that is not ventricular in origin the term is generally used in the context of paroxysmal SVT. Episodes are characterised by the sudden onset of a narrow complex tachycardia, typically an atrioventricular nodal re\-entry tachycardia (AVNRT). Other causes include atrioventricular re\-entry tachycardias (AVRT) and junctional tachycardias.

Management
----------

  
Acute management  
* vagal manoeuvres:
	+ Valsalva manoeuvre: e.g. trying to blow into an empty plastic syringe
	+ carotid sinus massage
* intravenous adenosine
	+ rapid IV bolus of  6mg → if unsuccessful give 12 mg → if unsuccessful give further 18 mg
	+ contraindicated in asthmatics \- verapamil is a preferable option
* electrical cardioversion

  
Prevention of episodes  
* beta\-blockers
* radio\-frequency ablation
