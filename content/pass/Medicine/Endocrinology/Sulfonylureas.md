Sulfonylureas are oral hypoglycaemic drugs used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. They work by increasing pancreatic insulin secretion and hence are only effective if functional B\-cells are present. On a molecular level they bind to an ATP\-dependent K\+(KATP) channel on the cell membrane of pancreatic beta cells.  
  
Common adverse effects  
* hypoglycaemic episodes (more common with long\-acting preparations such as chlorpropamide)
* weight gain

  
Rarer adverse effects  
* hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion
* bone marrow suppression
* hepatotoxicity (typically cholestatic)
* peripheral neuropathy

  
Sulfonylureas should be avoided in breastfeeding and pregnancy.
