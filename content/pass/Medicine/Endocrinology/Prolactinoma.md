Prolactinomas are a type of pituitary adenoma, a benign tumour of the pituitary gland.   
  
Pituitary adenomas can be classified according to:  
* **size** (a microadenoma is \<1cm and a macroadenoma is \>1cm)
* **hormonal status** (a secretory/functioning adenoma produces and excess of a particular hormone and a non\-secretory/functioning adenoma does not produce a hormone to excess)

  
Prolactinomas are the most common type and they produce an excess of prolactin.  
  
Features   
* excess prolactin in women
	+ amenorrhoea
	+ infertility
	+ galactorrhoea
	+ osteoporosis
* excess prolactin in men
	+ impotence
	+ loss of libido
	+ galactorrhoea
* other symptoms may be seen with macroadenomas
	+ headache.
	+ visual disturbances (classically, a bitemporal hemianopia (lateral visual fields) or upper temporal quadrantanopia)
	+ symptoms and signs of hypopituitarism

  
Diagnosis  
* MRI

  
Management  
* in the majority of cases, symptomatic patients are treated medically with dopamine agonists (e.g. cabergoline, bromocriptine) which inhibit the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland
* surgery is performed for patients who cannot tolerate or fail to respond to medical therapy. A trans\-sphenoidal approach is generally preferred unless there is a significant extra\-pituitary extension
