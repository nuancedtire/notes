The interpretation of thyroid function tests is usually straightforward:  
  


| **Diagnosis** | **TSH** | **Free T4** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Thyrotoxicosis (e.g. Graves' disease) | Low | High | In T3 thyrotoxicosis the free T4 will be normal |
| Primary hypothyroidism (primary atrophic hypothyroidism) | High | Low |  |
| Secondary hypothyroidism | Low | Low | Replacement steroid therapy is required prior to thyroxine |
| Sick euthyroid syndrome\* | Low\*\* | Low | Common in hospital inpatientsT3 is particularly low in these patients |
| Subclinical hypothyroidism | High | Normal |  |
| Poor compliance with thyroxine | High | Normal |  |
| Steroid therapy | Low | Normal |  |
