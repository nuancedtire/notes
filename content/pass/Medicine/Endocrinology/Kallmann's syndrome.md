Kallmann's syndrome is a recognised cause of delayed puberty secondary to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. It is usually inherited as an X\-linked recessive trait. Kallmann's syndrome is thought to be caused by failure of GnRH\-secreting neurons to migrate to the hypothalamus.  
  
The clue given in many questions is lack of smell (anosmia) in a boy with delayed puberty.
