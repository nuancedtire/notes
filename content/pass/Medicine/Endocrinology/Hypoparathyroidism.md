Primary hypoparathyroidism  
* decrease PTH secretion
* e.g. secondary to thyroid surgery\*
* low calcium, high phosphate
* treated with alfacalcidol

  
The main symptoms of hypoparathyroidism are secondary to hypocalcaemia:  
* tetany: muscle twitching, cramping and spasm
* perioral paraesthesia
* Trousseau's sign: carpal spasm if the brachial artery occluded by inflating the blood pressure cuff and maintaining pressure above systolic
* Chvostek's sign: tapping over parotid causes facial muscles to twitch
* if chronic: depression, cataracts
* ECG: prolonged QT interval

  
Pseudohypoparathyroidism  
* target cells being insensitive to PTH
* due to abnormality in a G protein
* associated with low IQ, short stature, shortened 4th and 5th metacarpals
* low calcium, high phosphate, high PTH
* diagnosis is made by measuring urinary cAMP and phosphate levels following an infusion of PTH. In hypoparathyroidism this will cause an increase in both cAMP and phosphate levels. In pseudohypoparathyroidism type I neither cAMP nor phosphate levels are increased whilst in pseudohypoparathyroidism type II only cAMP rises.

   
Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism  
* similar phenotype to pseudohypoparathyroidism but normal biochemistry

  
\*this may seem an oxymoron, but most medical textbooks classify hypoparathyroidism which is secondary to surgery as being 'primary hypoparathyroidism'
