Causes  
* insulinoma \- increased ratio of proinsulin to insulin
* self\-administration of insulin/sulphonylureas
* liver failure
* Addison's disease
* alcohol
	+ causes exaggerated insulin secretion
	+ mechanism is thought to be due to the effect of alcohol on the pancreatic microcirculation → redistribution of pancreatic blood flow from the exocrine into the endocrine parts → increased insulin secretion
* nesidioblastosis \- beta cell hyperplasia

  
Physiological response to hypoglycaemia  
* hormonal response: the first response of the body is decreased insulin secretion. This is followed by increased glucagon secretion. Growth hormone and cortisol are also released but later
* sympathoadrenal response: increased catecholamine\-mediated (adrenergic) and acetylcholine\-mediated (cholinergic) neurotransmission in the peripheral autonomic nervous system and in the central nervous system

  
Features  
* blood glucose levels and the severity of symptoms are not always correlated, especially in patients with diabetes.
* blood glucose concentrations \<3\.3 mmol/L cause autonomic symptoms due to the release of glucagon and adrenaline (average frequency in brackets):
	+ Sweating
	+ Shaking
	+ Hunger
	+ Anxiety
	+ Nausea
* blood glucose concentrations below \<2\.8 mmol/L cause neuroglycopenic symptoms due to inadequate glucose supply to the brain:
	+ Weakness
	+ Vision changes
	+ Confusion
	+ Dizziness
* Severe and uncommon features of hypoglycaemia include:
	+ Convulsion
	+ Coma

  
Management of hypoglycaemia  
* the following guidelines are based on the BNF hypoglycaemia treatment summary.
* in the community (for example, diabetes mellitus patients who inject insulin):
	+ Initially, oral glucose 10\-20g should be given in liquid, gel or tablet form
	+ Alternatively, a propriety quick\-acting carbohydrate may be given: GlucoGel or Dextrogel.
	+ A 'HypoKit' may be prescribed which contains a syringe and vial of glucagon for IM or SC injection at home
* in a hospital setting:
	+ If the patient is alert, a quick\-acting carbohydrate may be given (as above)
	+ If the patient is unconscious or unable to swallow, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection glucagon may be given.
	+ Alternatively, intravenous 20% glucose solution may be given through a large vein
