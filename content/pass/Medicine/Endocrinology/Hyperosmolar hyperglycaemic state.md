Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) is a medical emergency that can be difficult to manage and has a significant associated mortality (up to 20%). Hyperglycaemia results in osmotic diuresis, severe dehydration, and electrolyte deficiencies. HHS typically presents in the elderly with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).  
  
Pathophysiology  
* hyperglycaemia → ↑ serum osmolality → osmotic diuresis → severe volume depletion

  
Precipitating factors  
* intercurrent illness
* dementia
* sedative drugs

  
Clinical features  
* whilst DKA presents within hours of onset, HHS comes on over many days, and consequently, the dehydration and metabolic disturbances may be more extreme
* consequences of volume loss
	+ clinical signs of dehydration
	+ polyuria
	+ polydipsia
* systemic
	+ lethargy
	+ nausea and vomiting
* neurological
	+ altered level of consciousness
	+ focal neurological deficits
* haematological
	+ hyperviscosity (may result in myocardial infarctions, stroke and peripheral arterial thrombosis)

  
There are no precise **diagnostic criteria** but the following are typically seen  
* hypovolaemia
* marked hyperglycaemia (\>30 mmol/L)
* significantly raised serum osmolarity (\> 320 mosmol/kg)
	+ can be calculated by: 2 \* Na\+ \+ glucose \+ urea
* no significant hyperketonaemia (\<3 mmol/L)
* no significant acidosis (bicarbonate \> 15 mmol/l or pH \> 7\.3 \- acidosis can occur due to lactic acidosis or renal impairment)

  
Management  
* fluid replacement
	+ fluid losses in HHS are estimated to be between 100 \- 220 ml/kg
	+ IV 0\.9% sodium chloride solution
	+ typically given at 0\.5 \- 1 L/hour depending on clinical assessment
	+ potassium levels should be monitored and added to fluids depending on the level
* insulin
	+ should not be given unless blood glucose stops falling while giving IV fluids
* venous thromboembolism prophylaxis
	+ patients are at risk of thrombosis due to hyperviscosity

  
Complications  
* vascular complications may occur due to hyperviscosity:
	+ such as myocardial infarction
	+ stroke
