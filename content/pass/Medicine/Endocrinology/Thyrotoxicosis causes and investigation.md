Graves' disease accounts for around 50\-60% of cases of thyrotoxicosis.  
  
Causes  
* Graves' disease
* toxic nodular goitre
* acute phase of subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis
* acute phase of post\-partum thyroiditis
* acute phase of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (later results in hypothyroidism)
* amiodarone therapy
* contrast
	+ rare, more commonly occurs in elderly patients with pre\-existing thyroid disease (e.g. multinodular goitre, Graves')
	+ patients with existing thyrotoxicosis should not receive iodinated contrast medium
	+ administration of iodinated contrast results in a large iodine load to the thyroid â†’ hyperthyroidism developing over 2\-12 weeks

  
Investigation  
* TSH down, T4 and T3 up
* thyroid autoantibodies
* other investigations are not routinely done but includes isotope scanning
