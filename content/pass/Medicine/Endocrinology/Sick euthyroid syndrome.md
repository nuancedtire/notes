In sick euthyroid syndrome (now referred to as non\-thyroidal illness) it is often said that everything (TSH, thyroxine and T3\) is low. In the majority of cases however the TSH level is within the \>normal range (inappropriately normal given the low thyroxine and T3\).  
  
Changes are reversible upon recovery from the systemic illness and hence no treatment is usually needed.
