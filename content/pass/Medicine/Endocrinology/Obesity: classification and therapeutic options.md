Management
----------

  
The management of obesity consists of a step\-wise approach:  
* conservative: diet, exercise
* medical
	+ orlistat
	+ liraglutide
* surgical

  
Orlistat is a pancreatic lipase inhibitor used in the management of obesity. Adverse effects include faecal urgency/incontinence and flatulence. A lower dose version is now available without prescription ('Alli'). NICE have defined criteria for the use of orlistat. It should only be prescribed as part of an overall plan for managing obesity in adults who have:  
* BMI of 28 kg/m^2 or more with associated risk factors, or
* BMI of 30 kg/m^2 or more
* continued weight loss e.g. 5% at 3 months
* orlistat is normally used for \< 1 year

  
Liraglutide  
* a glucagon\-like peptide\-1 (GLP\-1\) mimetic that is used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
* given as a once daily subcutaneous injection
* when used in the management of T2DM it was noted to cause weight loss in a significant proportion leading to research interest in its use in obesity
* current NICE criteria for use (see link for full criteria):
	+ person has a BMI of at least 35 kg/m²
	+ prediabetic hyperglycaemia (e.g. HbA1c 42 \- 47 mmol/mol)
