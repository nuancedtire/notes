Thiazolidinediones are a class of agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. They are agonists to the PPAR\-gamma receptor and reduce peripheral insulin resistance. Rosiglitazone was withdrawn in 2010 following concerns about the cardiovascular side\-effect profile.  
  
The PPAR\-gamma receptor is an intracellular nuclear receptor. It's natural ligands are free fatty acids and it is thought to control adipocyte differentiation and function.  
  
Adverse effects  
* weight gain
* liver impairment: monitor LFTs
* fluid retention \- therefore contraindicated in heart failure. The risk of fluid retention is increased if the patient also takes insulin
* recent studies have indicated an increased risk of fractures
* bladder cancer: recent studies have shown an increased risk of bladder cancer in patients taking pioglitazone (hazard ratio 2\.64\)
