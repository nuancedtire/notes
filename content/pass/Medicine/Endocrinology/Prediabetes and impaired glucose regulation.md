Prediabetes is a term which is increasingly used where there is impaired glucose levels which are above the normal range but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. The term includes patients who have been labelled as having either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Diabetes UK estimate that around 1 in 7 adults in the UK have prediabetes. Many individuals with prediabetes will progress on to developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and they are therefore at greater risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications.  
  
Terminology  
* Diabetes UK currently recommend using the term prediabetes when talking to patients and impaired glucose regulation when talking to other healthcare professionals
* research has shown that the term 'prediabetes' has the most impact and is most easily understood

  
Identification of patients with prediabetes  
* NICE recommend using a validated computer based risk assessment tool for all adults aged 40 and over, people of South Asian and Chinese descent aged 25\-39, and adults with conditions that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes
* patients identified at high risk should have a blood sample taken
* a fasting plasma glucose of 6\.1\-6\.9 mmol/l or an HbA1c level of 42\-47 mmol/mol (6\.0\-6\.4%) indicates high risk

Management  
* lifestyle modification: weight loss, increased exercise, change in diet
* at least yearly follow\-up with blood tests is recommended
* NICE recommend metformin for adults at high risk *'whose blood glucose measure (fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c) shows they are still progressing towards type 2 diabetes, despite their participation in an intensive lifestyle\-change programme'*

  
Impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance
-------------------------------------------------------

  
There are two main types of IGR:  
* impaired fasting glucose (IFG) \- due to hepatic insulin resistance
* impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) \- due to muscle insulin resistance
* patients with IGT are more likely to develop T2DM and cardiovascular disease than patients with IFG

  
Definitions  
* a fasting glucose greater than or equal to 6\.1 but less than 7\.0 mmol/l implies impaired fasting glucose (IFG)
* impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is defined as fasting plasma glucose less than 7\.0 mmol/l and OGTT 2\-hour value greater than or equal to 7\.8 mmol/l but less than 11\.1 mmol/l
* people with IFG should then be offered an oral glucose tolerance test to rule out a diagnosis of diabetes. A result below 11\.1 mmol/l but above 7\.8 mmol/l indicates that the person doesn't have diabetes but does have IGT
