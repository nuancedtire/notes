Diabetic foot disease is an important complication of diabetes mellitus which should be screen for on a regular basis. NICE produced guidelines relating to diabetic foot disease in 2015\.  
  
It occurs secondary to two main factors:  
* neuropathy: resulting in loss of protective sensation (e.g. not noticing a stone in the shoe), Charcot's arthropathy, dry skin
* peripheral arterial disease: diabetes is a risk factor for both macro and microvascular ischaemia

  
Presentations  
* neuropathy: loss of sensation
* ischaemia: absent foot pulses, reduced ankle\-brachial pressure index (ABPI), intermittent claudication
* complications: calluses, ulceration, Charcot's arthropathy, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, gangrene

  
All patients with diabetes should be screened for diabetic foot disease on at least an annual basis  
* screening for ischaemia: done by palpating for both the dorsalis pedis pulse and posterial tibial artery pulse
* screening for neuropathy: a 10 g monofilament is used on various parts of the sole of the foot

  
NICE recommend that we risk stratify patients:  
  


| Low risk | Moderate risk | High risk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • no risk factors except callus alone | • deformity or• neuropathy or• non\-critical limb ischaemia. | • previous ulceration or• previous amputation or• on renal replacement therapy or• neuropathy and non\-critical limb ischaemia together or• neuropathy in combination with callus and/or deformity or• non\-critical limb ischaemia in combination with callus and/or deformity. |

  
All patients who are moderate or high risk (I.e. any problems other than simple calluses) should be followed up regularly by the local diabetic foot centre.
