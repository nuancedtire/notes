Autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands is the most common cause of primary hypoadrenalism in the UK, accounting for 80% of cases. This is termed Addison's disease and results in reduced cortisol and aldosterone being produced.  
  
Features  
* lethargy, weakness, anorexia, nausea \& vomiting, weight loss, 'salt\-craving'
* hyperpigmentation (especially palmar creases)
	+ ACTH is derived from a larger precursor molecule called proopiomelanocortin (POMC). When POMC is cleaved to produce ACTH, other melanocyte\-stimulating hormones (MSH) are also produced. These MSHs have the effect of stimulating melanocytes in the skin to produce more melanin, the pigment responsible for skin colour
	+ primary Addison's is associated with hyperpigmentation whereas secondary adrenal insufficiency is not
* vitiligo
* loss of pubic hair in women
* hypotension
* hypoglycaemia
* hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia may be seen
* crisis: collapse, shock, pyrexia

  
Other causes of hypoadrenalism
------------------------------

  
Primary causes  
* tuberculosis
* metastases (e.g. bronchial carcinoma)
* meningococcal septicaemia (Waterhouse\-Friderichsen syndrome)
* HIV
* antiphospholipid syndrome

  
Secondary causes  
* pituitary disorders (e.g. tumours, irradiation, infiltration)

  
Exogenous glucocorticoid therapy
