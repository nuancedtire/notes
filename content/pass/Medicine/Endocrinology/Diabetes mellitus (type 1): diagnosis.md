The symptoms and signs in a new diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are typically those seen in diabetic ketoacidosis although the diagnosis is usually over a longer time frame.  
  
Features of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)  
* abdominal pain
* polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration
* Kussmaul respiration (deep hyperventilation)
* acetone\-smelling breath ('pear drops' smell)

  
Investigations  
* urine should be dipped for glucose and ketones
* fasting glucose and random glucose (see below for diagnostic thresholds)
* HbA1c is not as useful for patients with a possible or suspected diagnosis of T1DM as it may not accurately reflect a recent rapid rise in serum glucose
* C\-peptide levels are typically low in patients with T1DM
* diabetes\-specific autoantibodies are useful to distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes (see below)

  


| Antibody | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Antibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti\-GAD) | Present in around 80% of patients with T1DM |
| Islet cell antibodies (ICA, against cytoplasmic proteins in the beta cell) | Present in around 70\-80% of patients with T1DM |
| Insulin autoantibodies (IAA) | Presence in T1DM correlates strongly with age, found in over 90% of young children with T1DM but only 60% of older patients |
| Insulinoma\-associated\-2 autoantibodies (IA\-2A) |  |

  
  
Diagnostic criteria for type 1 diabetes mellitus
------------------------------------------------

  
If the patient is symptomatic:  
* fasting glucose greater than or equal to 7\.0 mmol/l
* random glucose greater than or equal to 11\.1 mmol/l (or after 75g oral glucose tolerance test)

  
If the patient is asymptomatic the above criteria apply but must be demonstrated on two separate occasions.  
  
  
Distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 diabetes meliitus
----------------------------------------------------------

  
The major differences are shown in the table below:  
  


|  | Type 1 diabetes | Type 2 diabetes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Age of onset** | Typically \< 20 years* however, 40% \> 30 years | Typically \> 40 years- however, may occur in younger, obese patients |
| **Speed of onset** | More acute, hours\-days | Slower, weeks\-months |
| **Weight of patient** | Recent weight loss typical | Obesity is strong risk factor and recent weight loss is rare |
| **Features** | Features of DKA as above | Milder symptoms e.g. polyuria, polydipsia |
| **Ketonuria** | Common | Rare |

  
NICE state the following:  
  
 *Diagnose type 1 diabetes on clinical grounds in adults presenting with hyperglycaemia, bearing in mind that people with type 1 diabetes typically (but not always) have one or more of:  
* ketosis
* rapid weight loss
* age of onset below 50 years
* BMI below 25 kg/m²
* personal and/or family history of autoimmune disease*  
In terms of diagnosing T1DM, NICE recommend the following on who may need further tests:   
  
 *Consider further investigation in adults that involves measurement of C\-peptide and/or diabetes\-specific autoantibody titres if:  
* type 1 diabetes is suspected but the clinical presentation includes some atypical features (for example, age 50 years or above, BMI of 25 kg/m² or above, slow evolution of hyperglycaemia or long prodrome)*  
Conversely, for patients suspected of type 2 diabetes, if they over the age of 40 years and respond well to oral hypoglycaemic agents do not need to undergo further testing for type 1 diabetes. For those in whom there is a doubt, C\-peptide levels and diabetes\-specific autoantibodies are the investigations of choice.  
  
Example scenarios  
* a 15\-year\-old presents with weight loss, lethargy. Ketones and glucose found in the urine. A random serum glucose is 14 mmol/L → T1DM, no need for further investigations
* a 38\-year\-old obese man presents with polyuria. A random glucose is 12\.5 mmol/L → Intermediate age for T1DM/T2DM, a risk factor for T2DM (obesity) but not clear cut \- do C\-peptide levels and diabetes\-specific autoantibodies
* a 52\-year\-old woman (body mass index 23 kg/m²) presents with polyuria and polydipsia. Ketones are present in the urine → age atypical for T1DM but other features consistent \- do C\-peptide levels and diabetes\-specific autoantibodies
* a 59\-year\-old obese man presents with polyuria. A random serum glucose is 12\.0 mmol/L → T2DM, no need for further investigations
