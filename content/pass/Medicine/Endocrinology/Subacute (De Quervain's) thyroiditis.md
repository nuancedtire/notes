Subacute thyroiditis (also known as De Quervain's thyroiditis and subacute granulomatous thyroiditis) is thought to occur following viral infection and typically presents with hyperthyroidism.  
  
There are typically 4 phases;  
* phase 1 (lasts 3\-6 weeks): hyperthyroidism, painful goitre, raised ESR
* phase 2 (1\-3 weeks): euthyroid
* phase 3 (weeks \- months): hypothyroidism
* phase 4: thyroid structure and function goes back to normal

  
Investigations  
* thyroid scintigraphy: globally reduced uptake of iodine\-131

  
Management  
* usually self\-limiting \- most patients do not require treatment
* thyroid pain may respond to aspirin or other NSAIDs
* in more severe cases steroids are used, particularly if hypothyroidism develops
