Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) may be a complication of existing type 1 diabetes mellitus or be the first presentation, accounting for around 6% of cases. Rarely, under conditions of extreme stress, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may also develop DKA.  
  
Whilst DKA remains a serious condition mortality rates have decreased from 8% to under 1% in the past 20 years.  
  
Pathophysiology  
* DKA is caused by uncontrolled lipolysis (not proteolysis) which results in an excess of free fatty acids that are ultimately converted to ketone bodies

  
The most common precipitating factors of DKA are infection, missed insulin doses and myocardial infarction.  
  
Features  
* abdominal pain
* polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration
* Kussmaul respiration (deep hyperventilation)
* Acetone\-smelling breath ('pear drops' smell)

  
Diagnostic criteria
-------------------

  


| American Diabetes Association (2009\) | Joint British Diabetes Societies (2013\) |
| --- | --- |
| Key points* glucose \> 13\.8 mmol/l * pH \< 7\.30 * serum bicarbonate \<18 mmol/l * anion gap \> 10 * ketonaemia | Key points* glucose \> 11 mmol/l or known diabetes mellitus * pH \< 7\.3 * bicarbonate \< 15 mmol/l * ketones \> 3 mmol/l or urine ketones \+\+ on dipstick |

  
Management
----------

  
Main principles of management  
* fluid replacement
	+ most patients with DKA are deplete around 5\-8 litres
	+ isotonic saline is used initially, even if the patient is severely acidotic
	+ please see an example fluid regime below.
* insulin
	+ an intravenous infusion should be started at 0\.1 unit/kg/hour
	+ once blood glucose is \< 14 mmol/l an infusion of 10% dextrose should be started at 125 mls/hr *in addition* to the 0\.9% sodium chloride regime
* correction of electrolyte disturbance
	+ serum potassium is often high on admission despite total body potassium being low
	+ this often falls quickly following treatment with insulin resulting in hypokalaemia
	+ potassium may therefore need to be added to the replacement fluids
	+ if the rate of potassium infusion is greater than 20 mmol/hour then cardiac monitoring may be required
* long\-acting insulin should be continued, short\-acting insulin should be stopped

  
### JBDS example of fluid replacement regime for patient with a systolic BP on admission 90mmHg and over

  


| Fluid | Volume |
| --- | --- |
| 0\.9% sodium chloride 1L | 1000ml over 1st hour |
| 0\.9% sodium chloride 1L with potassium chloride | 1000ml over next 2 hours |
| 0\.9% sodium chloride 1L with potassium chloride | 1000ml over next 2 hours |
| 0\.9% sodium chloride 1L with potassium chloride | 1000ml over next 4 hours |
| 0\.9% sodium chloride 1L with potassium chloride | 1000ml over next 4 hours |
| 0\.9% sodium chloride 1L with potassium chloride | 1000ml over next 6 hours |

  
Please note that slower infusion may be indicated in young adults (aged 18\-25 years) as they are at greater risk of cerebral oedema.  
  
### JBDS potassium guidelines

  


| Potassium level in first 24 hours (mmol/L) | Potassium replacement in mmol/L of infusion solution |
| --- | --- |
| Over 5\.5 | Nil |
| 3\.5\-5\.5 | 40 |
| Below 3\.5 | Senior review as additional potassium needs to be given |

  
Resolution
----------

  
DKA resolution is defined as:  
* pH \>7\.3 and
* blood ketones \< 0\.6 mmol/L and
* bicarbonate \> 15\.0mmol/L

   
Further points  
* both the ketonaemia and acidosis should have been resolved within 24 hours. If this hasn't happened the patient requires senior review from an endocrinologist
* if the above criteria are met and the patient is eating and drinking switch to subcutaneous insulin
* the patient should be reviewed by the diabetes specialist nurse prior to discharge

  
Complications
-------------

  
Complications may occur from DKA itself or the treatment:  
* gastric stasis
* thromboembolism
* arrhythmias secondary to hyperkalaemia/iatrogenic hypokalaemia
* iatrogenic due to incorrect fluid therapy: cerebral oedema\*, hypokalaemia, hypoglycaemia
* acute respiratory distress syndrome
* acute kidney injury

  
\* children/young adults are particularly vulnerable to cerebral oedema following fluid resuscitation in DKA and often need 1:1 nursing to monitor neuro\-observations, headache, irritability, visual disturbance, focal neurology etc. It usually occurs 4\-12 hours following commencement of treatment but can present at any time. If there is any suspicion a CT head and senior review should be sought
