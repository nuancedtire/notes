This section will consider:  
* the general lab findings consistent with Cushing's syndrome
* tests to confirm whether a patient indeed has Cushing's syndrome
* tests to find the underlying cause of Cushing's syndrome

  
It is useful to bear in mind the possible causes:  
* iatrogenic: corticosteroid therapy
* ACTH\-dependent causes
	+ Cushing's disease (a pituitary adenoma → ACTH secretion)
	+ ectopic ACTH secretion secondary to a malignancy
* ACTH\-independent causes
	+ adrenal adenoma

  
General findings consistent with Cushing's syndrome
---------------------------------------------------

  
A hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis may be seen, along with impaired glucose tolerance.  
  
Ectopic ACTH secretion (e.g. secondary to small cell lung cancer) is characteristically associated with very low potassium levels.   
  
Tests to confirm Cushing's syndrome
-----------------------------------

  
The three most commonly used tests are:  
* overnight (low\-dose) dexamethasone suppression test
	+ this is the most sensitive test and is now used first\-line to test for Cushing's syndrome
	+ patients with Cushing's syndrome do not have their morning cortisol spike suppressed
* 24 hr urinary free cortisol
	+ two measurements are required
* bedtime salivary cortisol
	+ two measurements are required

  
Localisation tests
------------------

  
The first\-line localisation is 9am and midnight plasma ACTH (and cortisol) levels. If ACTH is suppressed then a non\-ACTH dependent cause is likely such as an adrenal adenoma  
  
### High\-dose dexamethasone suppression test

  
The high\-dose dexamethasone suppression test may be used to localise the pathology resulting in Cushing's syndrome. This test may be interpreted as follows:  
  


| Cortisol | ACTH | Interpretation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Not suppressed | Suppressed | Cushing's syndrome due to other causes (e.g. adrenal adenomas) |
| Suppressed | Suppressed | Cushing's disease (i.e. pituitary adenoma → ACTH secretion) |
| Not suppressed | Not suppressed | Ectopic ACTH syndrome |

  
### Other tests

  
CRH stimulation  
* if pituitary source then cortisol rises
* if ectopic/adrenal then no change in cortisol

  
Petrosal sinus sampling of ACTH may be needed to differentiate between pituitary and ectopic ACTH secretion.  
  
An insulin stress test is used to differentiate between true Cushing's and pseudo\-Cushing's.
