Carbimazole is used in the management of thyrotoxicosis. It is typically given in high doses for 6 weeks until the patient becomes euthyroid before being reduced.  
  
Mechanism of action  
* blocks thyroid peroxidase from coupling and iodinating the tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin â†’ reducing thyroid hormone production
* in contrast propylthiouracil as well as this central mechanism of action also has a peripheral action by inhibiting 5'\-deiodinase which reduces peripheral conversion of T4 to T3

  
Adverse effects  
* agranulocytosis
* crosses the placenta, but may be used in low doses during pregnancy
