Patients who have Addison's disease are usually given both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy.  
  
This usually means that patients take a combination of:  
* hydrocortisone: usually given in 2 or 3 divided doses. Patients typically require 20\-30 mg per day, with the majority given in the first half of the day
* fludrocortisone

  
Patient education is important:  
* emphasise the importance of not missing glucocorticoid doses
* consider MedicAlert bracelets and steroid cards
* patients should be provided with hydrocortisone for injection with needles and syringes to treat an adrenal crisis
* discuss how to adjust the glucocorticoid dose during an intercurrent illness (see below)

  
Management of intercurrent illness  
* in simple terms the glucocorticoid dose should be doubled, with the fludrocortisone dose staying the same
* the Addison's Clinical Advisory Panel have produced guidelines detailing particular scenarios \- please see the CKS link for more details
