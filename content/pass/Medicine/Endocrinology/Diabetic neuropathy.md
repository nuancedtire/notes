Peripheral neuropathy
---------------------

  
Diabetes typically leads to sensory loss and not motor loss. Sensory loss typically results in a 'glove and stocking' distribution, with the lower legs affected first due to the length of the sensory neurons supplying this area. Painful diabetic neuropathy is also a common problem in clinical practice.  
  
NICE updated it's guidance on the management of neuropathic pain in 2013\. Diabetic neuropathy is now managed in the same way as other forms of neuropathic pain:  
* first\-line treatment: amitriptyline, duloxetine, gabapentin or pregabalin
* if the first\-line drug treatment does not work try one of the other 3 drugs
* tramadol may be used as 'rescue therapy' for exacerbations of neuropathic pain
* topical capsaicin may be used for localised neuropathic pain (e.g. post\-herpetic neuralgia)
* pain management clinics may be useful in patients with resistant problems

  
Gastrointestinal autonomic neuropathy
-------------------------------------

  
Gastroparesis  
* occurs secondary to autonomic neuropathy
* symptoms include erratic blood glucose control, bloating and vomiting
* management options include metoclopramide, domperidone or erythromycin (prokinetic agents)

  
Chronic diarrhoea  
* often occurs at night

  
Gastro\-oesophageal reflux disease  
* caused by decreased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure
