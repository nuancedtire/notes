Growth hormone (GH) levels vary during the day and are therefore not diagnostic.   
  
**Serum IGF\-1 levels** have now overtaken the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with serial GH measurements as the first\-line test. The OGTT test is recommended to confirm the diagnosis if IGF\-1 levels are raised.  
  
The Endocrine Society guidelines suggest the following:  
  
 **1\.1 We recommend measurement of IGF\-1 levels in patients with typical clinical manifestations of acromegaly, especially those with acral and facial features.   
...  
1\.5 In patients with elevated or equivocal serum IGF\-1 levels, we recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by finding lack of suppression of GH to \< 1 Âµg/L following documented hyperglycemia during an oral glucose load.**  
Serum IGF\-1 may also be used to monitor disease  
  
Oral glucose tolerance test  
* in normal patients GH is suppressed to \< 2 mu/L with hyperglycaemia
* in acromegaly there is no suppression of GH
* may also demonstrate impaired glucose tolerance which is associated with acromegaly

  
A pituitary MRI may demonstrate a pituitary tumour.
