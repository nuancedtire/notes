NICE updated its guidance on the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in 2022\. This update reflected the advances in drug therapy and improved evidence regarding newer therapies such as SGLT\-2 inhibitors.  
  
It's worthwhile thinking of the average patient who is taking metformin for T2DM, you can titrate up metformin and encourage lifestyle changes to aim for a HbA1c of 48 mmol/mol (6\.5%), but should only add a second drug if the HbA1c rises to 58 mmol/mol (7\.5%)  
  
  
Dietary advice  
* encourage high fibre, low glycaemic index sources of carbohydrates
* include low\-fat dairy products and oily fish
* control the intake of foods containing saturated fats and trans fatty acids
* limited substitution of sucrose\-containing foods for other carbohydrates is allowable, but care should be taken to avoid excess energy intake
* discourage the use of foods marketed specifically at people with diabetes
* initial target weight loss in an overweight person is 5\-10%

  
  
HbA1c targets
-------------

  
This is an area which has changed in 2015  
* individual targets should be agreed with patients to encourage motivation
* HbA1c should be checked every 3\-6 months until stable, then 6 monthly
* NICE encourage us to consider relaxing targets on *'a case\-by\-case basis, with particular consideration for people who are older or frail, for adults with type 2 diabetes'*
* in 2015 the guidelines changed so HbA1c targets are now dependent on treatment:

  
### Lifestyle or single\-drug treatment

  


| Management of T2DM | HbA1c target |
| --- | --- |
| Lifestyle | 48 mmol/mol (6\.5%) |
| Lifestyle \+ metformin | 48 mmol/mol (6\.5%) |
| Includes any drug which may cause hypoglycaemia (e.g. lifestyle \+ sulfonylurea) | 53 mmol/mol (7\.0%) |

  
Practical examples  
* a patient is newly diagnosed with HbA1c and wants to try lifestyle treatment first. You agree on a target of 48 mmol/mol (6\.5%)
* you review a patient 6 months after starting metformin. His HbA1c is 51 mmol/mol (6\.8%). You increase his metformin from 500mg bd to 500mg tds and reinforce lifestyle factors

  
### Patient already on treatment

  


| Management of T2DM | HbA1c target |
| --- | --- |
| Already on one drug, but HbA1c has risen to 58 mmol/mol (7\.5%) | 53 mmol/mol (7\.0%) |

  
Initial drug therapy

Simplified initial management of type 2 diabetes mellitus  
Metformin remains the first\-line drug of choice in type 2 diabetes mellitus.  
* metformin should be titrated up slowly to minimise the possibility of gastrointestinal upset
* if standard\-release metformin is not tolerated then modified\-release metformin should be trialled

  
SGLT\-2 inhibitors  
* should also be given in addition to metformin if any of the following apply:
	+ the patient has a high risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD, e.g. QRISK ≥ 10%)
	+ the patient has established CVD
	+ the patient has chronic heart failure
* metformin should be established and titrated up before introducing the SGLT\-2 inhibitor
* SGLT\-2 inhibitors should also be started at any point if a patient develops CVD (e.g. is diagnosed with ischaemic heart disease), a QRISK ≥ 10% or chronic heart failure

  
If metformin is contraindicated  
* if the patient has a risk of CVD, established CVD or chronic heart failure:
	+ SGLT\-2 monotherapy
* if the patient doesn't have a risk of CVD, established CVD or chronic heart failure:
	+ DPP\-4 inhibitor or pioglitazone or a sulfonylurea
	+ SGLT\-2 may be used if certain NICE criteria are met

  
  
Further drug therapy if HbA1c targets are not met
-------------------------------------------------

Simplified further management of type 2 diabetes mellitus if HbA1c targets are not met  
If the HbA1c has risen to 58 mmol/mol (7\.5%) then further treatment is indicated. Given the large number of drug therapy options, medication choices depend on individual clinical circumstances (comorbidities, contraindications, weight) and patient preference.  
  
### Second\-line therapy

  
Dual therapy \- add one of the following:  
* metformin \+ DPP\-4 inhibitor
* metformin \+ pioglitazone
* metformin \+ sulfonylurea
* metformin \+ SGLT\-2 inhibitor (if NICE criteria met)

  
### Third\-line therapy

  
If a patient does not achieve control on dual therapy then the following options are possible:  
* metformin \+ DPP\-4 inhibitor \+ sulfonylurea
* metformin \+ pioglitazone \+ sulfonylurea
* metformin \+ (pioglitazone or sulfonylurea or DPP\-4 inhibitor) \+ SGLT\-2 if certain NICE criteria are met
* insulin\-based treatment

  
### Further therapy

  
If triple therapy is not effective or tolerated consider switching one of the drugs for a GLP\-1 mimetic:  
* BMI ≥ 35 kg/m² and specific psychological or other medical problems associated with obesity or
* BMI \< 35 kg/m² and for whom insulin therapy would have significant occupational implications or weight loss would benefit other significant obesity\-related comorbidities
* only continue if there is a reduction of at least 11 mmol/mol \[1\.0%] in HbA1c and a weight loss of at least 3% of initial body weight in 6 months

  
GLP\-1 mimetics should only be added to insulin under specialist care  
  
Starting insulin  
* metformin should be continued. In terms of other drugs NICE advice: *'Review the continued need for other blood glucose\-lowering therapies'*
* NICE recommend starting with human NPH insulin (isophane, intermediate\-acting) taken at bed\-time or twice daily according to need

  
Practical examples  
* you review an established type 2 diabetic on maximum dose metformin. Her HbA1c is 55 mmol/mol (7\.2%). You do not add another drug as she has not reached the threshold of 58 mmol/mol (7\.5%)
* a type 2 diabetic is found to have an HbA1c of 62 mmol/mol (7\.8%) at annual review. They are currently on maximum dose metformin. You elect to add a sulfonylurea

Risk factor modification
------------------------

  
Hypertension  
* **blood pressure targets are the same as for patients without type 2 diabetes** (see table below)
* ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are first\-line
	+ an ARB is preferred if the patient has a black African or African\-Caribbean family origin

  


|  | **Clinic BP** | **ABPM / HBPM** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Age \< 80 years** | 140/90 mmHg | 135/85 mmHg |
| **Age \> 80 years** | 150/90 mmHg | 145/85 mmHg |

  
Antiplatelets  
* should not be offered unless a patient has existing cardiovascular disease

  
Lipids  
* following the 2014 NICE lipid modification guidelines only patients with a 10\-year cardiovascular risk \> 10% (using QRISK2\) should be offered a statin. The first\-line statin of choice is atorvastatin 20mg on
