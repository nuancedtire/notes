Despite many trials, there is no clear guidance on the optimal management of Graves' disease. Treatment options include anti\-thyroid drugs (ATDs, for example carbimazole), radioiodine treatment and surgery.   
  
Anti\-thyroid drugs have emerged as the most popular first\-line therapy for Graves' disease in recent years. Factors that particularly support their use include anti\-thyroid drugs significant symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, or patients with a significant risk of hyperthyroid complications (e.g. elderly patients, cardiovascular disease).  
  
Initial treatment to control symptoms  
* propranolol is used to help block the adrenergic effects

  
NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries recommended that patients with Graves' disease are referred to secondary care for ongoing treatment.  
* NICE suggest carbimazole should be considered in primary care if patients symptoms are not controlled with propanolol

  
ATD therapy  
* carbimazole is started at 40mg and reduced gradually to maintain euthyroidism
* typically continued for 12\-18 months
* the major complication of carbimazole therapy is agranulocytosis
* an alternative regime is termed 'block\-and\-replace'
	+ carbimazole is started at 40mg
	+ thyroxine is added when the patient is euthyroid
	+ treatment typically lasts for 6\-9 months
	+ patients following an ATD titration regime have been shown to suffer fewer side\-effects than those on a block\-and\-replace regime

  
Radioiodine treatment  
* often used in patients who relapse following ATD therapy or are resistant to primary ATD treatment
* contraindications include pregnancy (should be avoided for 4\-6 months following treatment) and age \< 16 years. Thyroid eye disease is a relative contraindication, as it may worsen the condition
* the proportion of patients who become hypothyroid depends on the dose given, but as a rule the majority of patient will require thyroxine supplementation after 5 years
