SGLT\-2 inhibitors reversibly inhibit sodium\-glucose co\-transporter 2 (SGLT\-2\) in the renal proximal convoluted tubule to reduce glucose reabsorption and increase urinary glucose excretion.  
  
Examples include canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin.  
  
Important adverse effects include  
* urinary and genital infection (secondary to glycosuria). Fournier's gangrene has also been reported
* normoglycaemic ketoacidosis
* increased risk of lower\-limb amputation: feet should be closely monitored

  
Patients taking SGLT\-2 drugs often lose weight, which can be beneficial in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
