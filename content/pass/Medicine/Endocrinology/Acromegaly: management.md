Trans\-sphenoidal surgery is the first\-line treatment for acromegaly in the majority of patients.  
  
If a pituitary tumour is inoperable or surgery unsuccessful then medication may be indicated:  
* somatostatin analogue
	+ directly inhibits the release of growth hormone
	+ for example octreotide
	+ effective in 50\-70% of patients
* pegvisomant
	+ GH receptor antagonist \- prevents dimerization of the GH receptor
	+ once daily s/c administration
	+ very effective \- decreases IGF\-1 levels in 90% of patients to normal
	+ doesn't reduce tumour volume therefore surgery still needed if mass effect
* dopamine agonists
	+ for example bromocriptine
	+ the first effective medical treatment for acromegaly, however now superseded by somatostatin analogues
	+ effective only in a minority of patients

  
External irradiation is sometimes used for older patients or following failed surgical/medical treatment
