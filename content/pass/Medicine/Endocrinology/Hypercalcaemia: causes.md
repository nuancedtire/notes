Two conditions account for 90% of cases of hypercalcaemia:  
* 1\. Primary hyperparathyroidism: commonest cause in non\-hospitalised patients
* 2\. Malignancy: the commonest cause in hospitalised patients. This may be due to a number of processes, including;
	+ PTHrP from the tumour e.g. squamous cell lung cancer
	+ bone metastases
	+ myeloma,: due primarily to increased osteoclastic bone resorption caused by local cytokines (e.g. IL\-1, tumour necrosis factor) released by the myeloma cells
* for this reason, measuring parathyroid hormone levels is the key investigation for patients with hypercalcaemia

  
Other causes include  
* sarcoidosis
	+ other causes of granulomas may lead to hypercalcaemia e.g. tuberculosis and histoplasmosis
* vitamin D intoxication
* acromegaly
* thyrotoxicosis
* Milk\-alkali syndrome
* drugs:
	+ thiazides
	+ calcium\-containing antacids
* dehydration
* Addison's disease
* Paget's disease of the bone
	+ usually normal in this condition but hypercalcaemia may occur with prolonged immobilisation
