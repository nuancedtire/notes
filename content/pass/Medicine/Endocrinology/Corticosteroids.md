Corticosteroids are amongst the most commonly prescribed therapies in clinical practice. They are used both systemically (oral or intravenous) or locally (skin creams, inhalers, eye drops, intra\-articular). They augment and in some cases replace the natural glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity of endogenous steroids.  
  
The relative glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid activity of commonly used steroids is shown below:  
  


| **Minimal glucocorticoid activity, very high mineralocorticoid activity,** | **Glucocorticoid activity, high mineralocorticoid activity,** | **Predominant glucocorticoid activity, low mineralocorticoid activity** | **Very high glucocorticoid activity, minimal mineralocorticoid activity** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fludrocortisone | Hydrocortisone | Prednisolone | DexamethasoneBetmethasone |

  
Side\-effects
-------------

  
The side effects of corticosteroids are numerous and represent the single greatest limitation on their usage. Side\-effects are more common with systemic and prolonged therapy.  
  
Glucocorticoid side\-effects  
* endocrine
	+ impaired glucose regulation
	+ increased appetite/weight gain
	+ hirsutism
	+ hyperlipidaemia
* Cushing's syndrome
	+ moon face
	+ buffalo hump
	+ striae
* musculoskeletal
	+ osteoporosis
	+ proximal myopathy
	+ avascular necrosis of the femoral head
* immunosuppression
	+ increased susceptibility to severe infection
	+ reactivation of tuberculosis
* psychiatric
	+ insomnia
	+ mania
	+ depression
	+ psychosis
* gastrointestinal
	+ peptic ulceration
	+ acute pancreatitis
* ophthalmic
	+ glaucoma
	+ cataracts
* suppression of growth in children
* intracranial hypertension
* neutrophilia

  
Mineralocorticoid side\-effects  
* fluid retention
* hypertension

  
Selected points on the use of corticosteroids:  
* patients on long\-term steroids should have their doses doubled during intercurrent illness
* longer\-term systemic corticosteroids suppress the natural production of endogenous steroids. They should therefore not be withdrawn abruptly, as this may precipitate an Addisonian crisis
* the BNF suggests gradual withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids if patients have:
	+ received more than 40mg prednisolone daily for more than one week
	+ received more than 3 weeks of treatment
	+ recently received repeated courses
