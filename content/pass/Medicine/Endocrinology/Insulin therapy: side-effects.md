Hypoglycaemia  
* patients should be taught the signs of hypoglycaemia: sweating, anxiety, blurred vision, confusion, aggression
* conscious patients should take 10\-20g of a short\-acting carbohydrate (e.g. a glass of Lucozade or non\-diet drink, three or more glucose tablets, glucose gel)
* every person treated with insulin should have a glucagon kit for emergencies where the patient is not able to orally ingest a short\-acting carbohydrate
* patients who have frequent hypoglycaemic episodes may develop reduced awareness. If this develops then allowing glycaemic control to slip for a period of time may restore their awareness
* beta\-blockers reduce hypoglycaemic awareness

  
Lipodystrophy  
* typically presents as atrophy/lumps of subcutaneous fat
* can be prevented by rotating the injection site
* may cause erractic insulin absorption
