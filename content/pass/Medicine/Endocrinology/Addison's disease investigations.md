In a patient with suspected Addison's disease the definite investigation is an ACTH stimulation test (short Synacthen test). Plasma cortisol is measured before and 30 minutes after giving Synacthen 250ug IM. Adrenal autoantibodies such as anti\-21\-hydroxylase may also be demonstrated.  
  
If an ACTH stimulation test is not readily available (e.g. in primary care) then sending a 9 am serum cortisol can be useful:  
* \> 500 nmol/l makes Addison's very unlikely
* \< 100 nmol/l is definitely abnormal
* 100\-500 nmol/l should prompt a ACTH stimulation test to be performed

  
Associated electrolyte abnormalities are seen in around one\-third of undiagnosed patients:  
* hyperkalaemia
* hyponatraemia
* hypoglycaemia
* metabolic acidosis
