A number of drugs to treat diabetes mellitus have become available in recent years. Much research has focused around the role of glucagon\-like peptide\-1 (GLP\-1\), a hormone released by the small intestine in response to an oral glucose load  
  
Whilst it is well known that insulin resistance and insufficient B\-cell compensation occur other effects are also seen in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In normal physiology an oral glucose load results in a greater release of insulin than if the same load is given intravenously \- this known as the incretin effect. This effect is largely mediated by GLP\-1 and is known to be decreased in T2DM.  
  
Increasing GLP\-1 levels, either by the administration of an analogue (glucagon\-like peptide\-1, GLP\-1 mimetics, e.g. exenatide) or inhibiting its breakdown (dipeptidyl peptidase\-4 ,DPP\-4 inhibitors \- the gliptins), is therefore the target of two recent classes of drug.  
  
  
Glucagon\-like peptide\-1 (GLP\-1\) mimetics (e.g. exenatide)
-------------------------------------------------------------

  
Exenatide is an example of a glucagon\-like peptide\-1 (GLP\-1\) mimetic. These drugs increase insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon secretion. One of the major advances of GLP\-1 mimetics is that they typically result in weight loss, in contrast to many medications such as insulin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. They are sometimes used in combination with insulin in T2DM to minimise weight gain.  
  
Exenatide must be given by subcutaneous injection within 60 minutes before the morning and evening meals. It should not be given after a meal.  
  
Liraglutide is the other GLP\-1 mimetic currently available. One the main advantages of liraglutide over exenatide is that it only needs to be given once a day.  
  
Both exenatide and liraglutide may be combined with metformin and a sulfonylurea. Standard release exenatide is also licensed to be used with basal insulin alone or with metformin. Please see the BNF for a more complete list of licensed indications.  
  
NICE state the following:  
  
 **Consider adding exenatide to metformin and a sulfonylurea if:  
* BMI \>\= 35 kg/m² in people of European descent and there are problems associated with high weight, or
* BMI \< 35 kg/m² and insulin is unacceptable because of occupational implications or weight loss would benefit other comorbidities.**  
NICE like patients to have achieved a \> 11 mmol/mol (1%) reduction in HbA1c and 3% weight loss after 6 months to justify the ongoing prescription of GLP\-1 mimetics.  
  
The major adverse effect of GLP\-1 mimetics is nausea and vomiting. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency has issued specific warnings on the use of exenatide, reporting that is has been linked to severe pancreatitis in some patients.  
  
  
Dipeptidyl peptidase\-4 (DPP\-4\) inhibitors (e.g. Vildagliptin, sitagliptin)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Key points  
* dipeptidyl peptidase\-4, DPP\-4 inhibitors increase levels of incretins (GLP\-1 and GIP) by decreasing their peripheral breakdown
* oral preparation
* trials to date show that the drugs are relatively well tolerated with no increased incidence of hypoglycaemia
* do not cause weight gain

  
NICE guidelines on DPP\-4 inhibitors  
* NICE suggest that a DPP\-4 inhibitor might be preferable to a thiazolidinedione if further weight gain would cause significant problems, a thiazolidinedione is contraindicated or the person has had a poor response to a thiazolidinedione
