It should be noted that exogenous causes of Cushing's syndrome (e.g. glucocorticoid therapy) are far more common than endogenous ones.  
  
ACTH dependent causes  
* Cushing's disease (80%): pituitary tumour secreting ACTH producing adrenal hyperplasia
* ectopic ACTH production (5\-10%): e.g. small cell lung cancer is the most common causes

  
ACTH independent causes  
* iatrogenic: steroids
* adrenal adenoma (5\-10%)
* adrenal carcinoma (rare)
* Carney complex: syndrome including cardiac myxoma
* micronodular adrenal dysplasia (very rare)

  
Pseudo\-Cushing's  
* mimics Cushing's
* often due to alcohol excess or severe depression
* causes false positive dexamethasone suppression test or 24 hr urinary free cortisol
* insulin stress test may be used to differentiate
