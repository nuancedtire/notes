The long\-term management of type 1 diabetics is an important and complex process requiring the input of many different clinical specialties and members of the healthcare team. A diagnosis of type 1 diabetes can still reduce the life expectancy of patients by 13 years and the micro and macrovascular complications are well documented.  
  
NICE released guidelines on the diagnosis and management of type 1 diabetes in 2015\. We've only highlighted a very select amount of the guidance here which will be useful for any clinician looking after a patient with type 1 diabetes.  
  
HbA1c  
* should be monitored every 3\-6 months
* adults should have a target of HbA1c level of 48 mmol/mol (6\.5%) or lower. NICE do however recommend taking into account factors such as the person's daily activities, aspirations, likelihood of complications, comorbidities, occupation and history of hypoglycaemia

  
Self\-monitoring of blood glucose  
* recommend testing at least 4 times a day, including before each meal and before bed
* more frequent monitoring is recommended if frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes increases; during periods of illness; before, during and after sport; when planning pregnancy, during pregnancy and while breastfeeding

  
Blood glucose targets  
* 5\-7 mmol/l on waking and
* 4\-7 mmol/l before meals at other times of the day

  
Type of insulin  
* offer multiple daily injection basal\-bolus insulin regimens, rather than twice\-daily mixed insulin regimens, as the insulin injection regimen of choice for all adults
* twice\-daily insulin detemir is the regime of choice. Once\-daily insulin glargine or insulin detemir is an alternative
* offer rapid\-acting insulin analogues injected before meals, rather than rapid\-acting soluble human or animal insulins, for mealtime insulin replacement for adults with type 1 diabetes

  
Metformin  
* NICE recommend considering adding metformin if the BMI \>\= 25 kg/m²
