There are many possible causes of a red eye. It is important to be able to recognise the causes which require urgent referral to an ophthalmologist. Below is a brief summary of the key distinguishing features  
  
Acute angle closure glaucoma  
* severe pain (may be ocular or headache)
* decreased visual acuity, patient sees haloes
* semi\-dilated pupil
* hazy cornea

  
Anterior uveitis  
* acute onset
* pain
* blurred vision and photophobia
* small, fixed oval pupil, ciliary flush

  
Scleritis  
* severe pain (may be worse on movement) and tenderness
* may be underlying autoimmune disease e.g. rheumatoid arthritis

  
Conjunctivitis  
* purulent discharge if bacterial, clear discharge if viral

  
Subconjunctival haemorrhage  
* history of trauma or coughing bouts

  
Endophthalmitis  
* typically red eye, pain and visual loss following intraocular surgery
