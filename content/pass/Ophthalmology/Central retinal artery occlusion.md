Central retinal artery occlusion is a relatively rare cause of sudden unilateral visual loss. It is due to thromboembolism (from atherosclerosis) or arteritis (e.g. temporal arteritis)  
  
Features  
* sudden, painless unilateral visual loss
* relative afferent pupillary defect
* 'cherry red' spot on a pale retina

Management is difficult and the prognosis is poor  
* any underlying conditions should be identified and treated (e.g. intravenous steroids for temporal arteritis)
* if a patient presents acutely then Intraarterial thrombolysis may be attempted but currently, trials show mixed results.
