Anterior uveitis is one of the important differentials of a red eye. It is also referred to as iritis. Anterior uveitis describes inflammation of the anterior portion of the uvea \- iris and ciliary body. It is associated with HLA\-B27 and may be seen in association with other HLA\-B27 linked conditions (see below).  
  
Features  
* acute onset
* ocular discomfort \& pain (may increase with use)
* pupil may be small \+/\- irregular due to sphincter muscle contraction
* photophobia (often intense)
* blurred vision
* red eye
* lacrimation
* ciliary flush: a ring of red spreading outwards
* hypopyon; describes pus and inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber, often resulting in a visible fluid level
* visual acuity initially normal â†’ impaired

  
Associated conditions  
* ankylosing spondylitis
* reactive arthritis
* ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease
* Behcet's disease
* sarcoidosis: bilateral disease may be seen

  
Management  
* urgent review by ophthalmology
* cycloplegics (dilates the pupil which helps to relieve pain and photophobia) e.g. Atropine, cyclopentolate
* steroid eye drops
