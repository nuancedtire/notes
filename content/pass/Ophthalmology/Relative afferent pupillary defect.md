Also known as the Marcus\-Gunn pupil, a relative afferent pupillary defect is found by the 'swinging light test'. It is caused by a lesion anterior to the optic chiasm i.e. optic nerve or retina  
  
Finding  
* the affected and normal eye appears to dilate when light is shone on the affected

  
Causes  
* retina: detachment
* optic nerve: optic neuritis e.g. multiple sclerosis

  
Pathway of pupillary light reflex  
* afferent: retina → optic nerve → lateral geniculate body → midbrain
* efferent: Edinger\-Westphal nucleus (midbrain) → oculomotor nerve
