Distinguishing between causes  
* heterochromia (difference in iris colour) is seen in congenital Horner's
* anhidrosis: see below
* pharmacologic tests
	+ can be useful to confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome and localise the lesion
	+ apraclonidine drops (an alpha\-adrenergic agonist) can be used: causes pupillary dilation in Horner's syndrome due to denervation supersensitivity but produces mild pupillary constriction in the normal pupil by down\-regulating the norepinephrine release at the synaptic cleft

\*in reality the appearance is due to a narrow palpebral aperture rather than true enophthalmos
