Orbital cellulitis is the result of an infection affecting the fat and muscles posterior to the orbital septum, within the orbit but not involving the globe. It is usually caused by a spreading upper respiratory tract infection from the sinuses and carries a high mortality rate. Orbital cellulitis is a medical emergency requiring hospital admission and urgent senior review.   
  
Periorbital (preseptal) cellulitis is a less serious superficial infection anterior to the orbital septum, resulting from a superficial tissue injury (chalazion, insect bite etc...). Periorbital cellulitis can progress to orbital cellulitis.  
  
Risk factors  
* Childhood
	+ Mean age of hospitalisation 7\-12 years
* Previous sinus infection
* Lack of *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib) vaccination
* Recent eyelid infection/ insect bite on eyelid (periorbital cellulitis)
* Ear or facial infection

  
Presentation  
* Redness and swelling around the eye
* Severe ocular pain
* Visual disturbance
* Proptosis
* Ophthalmoplegia/pain with eye movements
* Eyelid oedema and ptosis
* Drowsiness \+/\- Nausea/vomiting in meningeal involvement (Rare)

  
Differentiating orbital from preseptal cellulitis  
* reduced visual acuity, proptosis, ophthalmoplegia/pain with eye movements are NOT consistent with preseptal cellulitis

  
Investigations  
* Full blood count \- WBC elevated, raised inflammatory markers.
* Clinical examination involving complete ophthalmological assessment \- Decreased vision, afferent pupillary defect, proptosis, dysmotility, oedema, erythema.
* CT with contrast \- Inflammation of the orbital tissues deep to the septum, sinusitis.
* Blood culture and microbiological swab to determine the organism. Most common bacterial causes \- *Streptococcus*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Haemophilus influenzae B*.

  
Management  
* admission to hospital for IV antibiotics
