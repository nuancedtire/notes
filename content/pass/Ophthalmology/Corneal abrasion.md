Corneal abrasions refer to any defect of the corneal epithelium and most commonly come about from a recent history of local trauma (e.g. fingernails, branches).   
  
Features  
* eye pain
* lacrimation
* photophobia
* foreign body sensation and conjunctival injection
* decreased visual acuity in the affected eye

  
Investigation  
* fluorescein staining
	+ examination typically reveals a yellow\-stained abrasion (representative of the de\-epithelialized surface) which is usually visible to the naked eye
	+ visualisation is enhanced by the use of a cobalt blue filter (available on an ophthalmoscope) or a Wood's lamp

  
Management  
* a topical antibiotic is recommended for these patients in order to prevent secondary bacterial infection.
