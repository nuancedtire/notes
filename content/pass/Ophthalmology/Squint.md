Squint (strabismus) is characterised by misalignment of the visual axes. Squints may be divided into concomitant (common) and paralytic (rare). It is important to detect as uncorrected may lead to amblyopia (the brain fails to fully process inputs from one eye and over time favours the other eye).

Detection of a squint may be made by the corneal light reflection test \- holding a light source 30cm from the child's face to see if the light reflects symmetrically on the pupils  
  
The cover test is used to identify the nature of the squint  
* ask the child to focus on an object
* cover one eye
* observe movement of uncovered eye
* cover other eye and repeat test

  
Management  
* referral to secondary care
	+ eye patches may help prevent amblyopia
