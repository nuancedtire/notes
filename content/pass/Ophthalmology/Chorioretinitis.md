Chorioretinitis is an inflammatory condition affecting the choroid and retina of the eye. This dual inflammation can be precipitated by infectious or autoimmune aetiologies, leading to the potential for significant visual impairment if not promptly and effectively managed.  
  
Causes  
* infectious
	+ toxoplasmosis: most prevalent cause worldwide
	+ cytomegalovirus: particularly in immunocompromised individuals such as HIV patients
	+ syphilis
	+ tuberculosis
* autoimmune
	+ sarcoidosis
	+ Behçet's disease
	+ systemic lupus erythematosus

  
Pathophysiology  
* infectious agents
	+ may reach the choroid and retina through haematogenous spread or direct extension from adjacent structures
	+ once established, these pathogens → inflammatory response, characterized by the infiltration of inflammatory cells → disruption of the normal choroidal and retinal architecture
* autoimmune conditions
	+ an inappropriate immune response against self\-antigens in the choroid and retina → similar inflammatory changes

  
Clinical features  
* patients with chorioretinitis often present with unilateral vision changes
* blurred vision
* scotomas (blind spots)
* floaters
* ophthalmoscopic finding
	+ focal or diffuse areas of retinal whitening
	+ 'pizza pie' fundus: retinal spots (superficial retinal infarction \+ flame\-shaped haemorrhages

  
Management  
* infectious
	+ pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for toxoplasmosis
	+ ganciclovir or valganciclovir for CMV
* autoimmune
	+ systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment, often in combination with other immunosuppressive agents like methotrexate or azathioprine for more severe or refractory cases
