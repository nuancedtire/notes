Glaucomas are optic neuropathies associated with raised intraocular pressure (IOP). They can be classified based on whether the peripheral iris is covering the trabecular meshwork, which is important in the drainage of aqueous humour from the anterior chamber of the eye. In open\-angle glaucoma, the iris is clear of the meshwork. The trabecular network functionally offers an increased resistance to aqueous outflow, causing increased IOP.  
  
The aim of treatment is to lower intra\-ocular pressure which in turn has been shown to prevent progressive loss of visual field.  
  
NICE guidelines  
* offer 360° selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) first\-line to people with an IOP of ≥ 24 mmHg [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng81/chapter/Recommendations#treatment:~:text=Offer%20360%C2%B0%20selective%20laser%20trabeculoplasty%20(SLT) "NICE - 2017 Glaucoma guidelines")
	+ 360° SLT can delay the need for eye drops and can reduce but does not remove the chance they will be needed at all
	+ a second 360° SLT procedure may be needed at a later date
* prostaglandin analogue (PGA) eyedrops should be used next\-line [NICE](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng81/chapter/Recommendations#treatment:~:text=Offer%20a%20generic%20prostaglandin%20analogue%20(PGA) "NICE - 2017 Glaucoma guidelines")
* the next line of treatments includes:
	+ beta\-blocker eye drops
	+ carbonic anhydrase inhibitor eye drops
	+ sympathomimetic eye drops
* surgery in the form of a trabeculectomy may be considered in refractory cases.

  


| **Medication** | **Mode of action** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Prostaglandin analogues (e.g. latanoprost) | Increases uveoscleral outflow | Once daily administrationAdverse effects include brown pigmentation of the iris, increased eyelash length |
| Beta\-blockers (e.g. timolol, betaxolol) | Reduces aqueous production | Should be avoided in asthmatics and patients with heart block |
| Sympathomimetics (e.g. brimonidine, an alpha2\-adrenoceptor agonist) | Reduces aqueous production and increases outflow | Avoid if taking MAOI or tricyclic antidepressantsAdverse effects include hyperaemia |
| Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g. Dorzolamide) | Reduces aqueous production | Systemic absorption may cause sulphonamide\-like reactions |
| Miotics (e.g. pilocarpine, a muscarinic receptor agonist) | Increases uveoscleral outflow | Adverse effects included a constricted pupil, headache and blurred vision |
