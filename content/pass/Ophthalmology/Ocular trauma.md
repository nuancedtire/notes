Hyphema (blood in the anterior chamber of the eye) \- especially in the context of trauma warrants urgent referral to an ophthalmic specialist for assessment and management. The main risk to sight comes from raised intraocular pressure which can develop due to the blockage of the angle and trabecular meshwork with erythrocytes. Strict bed rest is required as excessive movement can redisperse blood that had previously settled; therefore high\-risk cases are often admitted. Even isolated hyphema will require daily ophthalmic review and pressure checks initially as an outpatient.  
  
An assessment should also be made for orbital compartment syndrome, e.g. secondary to retrobulbar haemorrhage. This is true ophthalmic emergency
