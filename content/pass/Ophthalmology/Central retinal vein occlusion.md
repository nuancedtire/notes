Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a differential for sudden painless loss of vision.  
  
Risk factors  
* increasing age
* hypertension
* cardiovascular disease
* glaucoma
* polycythaemia

  
Features  
* sudden, painless reduction or loss of visual acuity, usually unilaterally
* fundoscopy
	+ widespread hyperaemia
	+ severe retinal haemorrhages \- 'stormy sunset'

  
A key differential is branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) \- this occurs when a vein in the distal retinal venous system is occluded and is thought to occur due to blockage of retinal veins at arteriovenous crossings. It results in a more limited area of the fundus being affected.

Management  
* the majority of patients are managed conservatively
* indications for treatment in patients with CRVO include:
	+ macular oedema \- intravitreal anti\-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents
	+ retinal neovascularization \- laser photocoagulation
