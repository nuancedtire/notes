Papilloedema describes optic disc swelling that is caused by increased intracranial pressure. It is almost always bilateral.  
  
The following features may be observed during fundoscopy:  
* venous engorgement: usually the first sign
* loss of venous pulsation: although many normal patients do not have normal pulsation
* blurring of the optic disc margin
* elevation of optic disc
* loss of the optic cup
* Paton's lines: concentric/radial retinal lines cascading from the optic disc
