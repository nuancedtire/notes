Sudden loss is a frightening symptom for patients. It may represent an ongoing issue or only be temporary. The term transient monocular visual loss (TMVL) describes a sudden, transient loss of vision that lasts less than 24 hours.   
  
The most common causes of a sudden painless loss of vision are as follows:  
* ischaemic/vascular (e.g. thrombosis, embolism, temporal arteritis etc). This includes recognised syndromes e.g. occlusion of central retinal vein and occlusion of central retinal artery
* vitreous haemorrhage
* retinal detachment
* retinal migraine

  
Ischaemic/vascular  
* often referred to as 'amaurosis fugax'
* wide differential including large artery disease (atherothrombosis, embolus, dissection), small artery occlusive disease (anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, vasculitis e.g. temporal arteritis), venous disease and hypoperfusion
* may represent a form of transient ischaemic attack (TIA). It should therefore be treated in a similar fashion, with aspirin 300mg being given
* altitudinal field defects are often seen: 'curtain coming down'
* ischaemic optic neuropathy is due to occlusion of the short posterior ciliary arteries, causing damage to the optic nerve

  
Central retinal vein occlusion  
* incidence increases with age, more common than arterial occlusion
* causes: glaucoma, polycythaemia, hypertension
* severe retinal haemorrhages are usually seen on fundoscopy

  
Central retinal artery occlusion  
* due to thromboembolism (from atherosclerosis) or arteritis (e.g. temporal arteritis)
* features include afferent pupillary defect, 'cherry red' spot on a pale retina

  
Vitreous haemorrhage  
* causes: diabetes, bleeding disorders, anticoagulants
* features may include sudden visual loss, dark spots

  
Retinal detachment  
* features of vitreous detachment, which may precede retinal detachment, include flashes of light or floaters (see below)

| **Posterior vitreous detachment** | **Retinal detachment** | **Vitreous haemorrhage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Flashes of light (photopsia) \- in the peripheral field of vision Floaters, often on the temporal side of the central vision | Dense shadow that starts peripherally progresses towards the central vision A veil or curtain over the field of vision Straight lines appear curved Central visual loss | Large bleeds cause sudden visual loss Moderate bleeds may be described as numerous dark spots Small bleeds may cause floaters |
