Subconjunctival haemorrhages result from the bleeding of blood vessels into the subconjunctival space. The vessels that bleed are usually the ones responsible for supplying the conjunctiva or episclera. The cause is most commonly traumatic followed by spontaneous idiopathic cases, Valsalva manoeuvres and several systemic diseases. Subconjunctival haemorrhages can look dramatic and cause worry to patients, however they are rarely an indicator of anything sinister.  
  
Epidemiology:
-------------

  
* Subconjunctival haemorrhages are more common in women than in men when there has been no history of trauma
* The annual incidence of non\-traumatic subconjunctival haemorrhages is 0\.6%, the risk increases with age as the risk factors are more common in elderly patients. Newborns are also more susceptible
* The incidence of both traumatic and non\-traumatic subconjunctival haemorrhages is 2\.6%

  
Risk factors:
-------------

  
* Trauma and contact lens usage (68%): these are the most common causes generally, as well as being often the sole risk factor in younger patients
* Idiopathic
* Valsalva manoeuvre e.g. coughing, straining
* Hypertension
* Bleeding disorders
* Drugs such as aspirin, NSAIDs and anticoagulants
* Diabetes
* Arterial disease and hyperlipidaemia

  
Symptoms:
---------

  
* Red\-eye, usually unilateral
* Subconjunctival haemorrhages are mostly asymptomatic, however mild irritation may be present

   
Signs:
------

  
* Flat, red patch on the conjunctiva. It will have well\-defined edges and normal conjunctiva surrounding it. Patches can vary in size depending on the size of the bleed, and can involve the whole conjunctiva
* Traumatic haemorrhages are most common in the temporal region (40\.5%), with the inferior conjunctiva as the next most commonly affected area
* Vision should be normal, including acuity, visual fields and range of eye movements
* On examination, the fundus should be normal

  
**Investigations:**  
* The diagnosis of a subconjunctival haemorrhage is a clinical one
* If there is no obvious traumatic cause, check the patient's blood pressure. If raised, refer the patient appropriately
* If the patient is taking warfarin, check the INR. If raised, refer for appropriate adjustments to the dose to bring the INR back into the target range
* If you cannot see the whole border of the haemorrhage i.e. the full extent of the haemorrhage is unclear, it may be associated with an intracranial bleed or an orbital roof fracture. This is often corroborated with a history of trauma and a black eye. Further appropriate investigations should then be done, including a full cranial nerve exam looking for neurological signs as well as a CT head, after discussion with a senior
* Recurrent or spontaneous, bilateral subconjunctival haemorrhages warrant investigations for bleeding disorders or other pathology

  
**Management:**  
* Reassure the patient that whilst a subconjunctival haemorrhage may look alarming, it is a benign condition that will resolve on its own in 2 to 3 weeks. If the patient presents to services immediately after the haemorrhage occurs, it can spread over a couple of days until it begins to resolve. The colour of the patch may change to yellow/ green, like a bruise, but preparing the patient for this will prevent any alarm if this happens.
* If the cause is traumatic consider a referral to the ophthalmologist to ensure no other damage has been caused to the eye
* Advise the patient to consult their GP if this happens again because, as previously mentioned, recurrent subconjunctival haemorrhages warrant investigations for bleeding disorders or other potential pathology
* Artificial tears can be used for a couple of weeks if there is any mild irritation

  
Prognosis:
----------

  
* This is a mild, self\-limiting illness and should resolve on it's own in 2\-3 weeks
