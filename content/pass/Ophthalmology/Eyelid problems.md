Eyelid problems commonly encountered include:  
* blepharitis: inflammation of the eyelid margins typically leading to a red eye

Different types of stye are recognised:  
* external (hordeolum externum): infection (usually staphylococcal) of the glands of Zeis (sebum producing) or glands of Moll (sweat glands).
* internal (hordeolum internum): infection of the Meibomian glands. May leave a residual chalazion (Meibomian cyst)
* management includes hot compresses and analgesia. CKS only recommend topical antibiotics if there is an associated conjunctivitis

  
A **chalazion (Meibomian cyst)** is a retention cyst of the Meibomian gland. It presents as a firm painless lump in the eyelid. The majority of cases resolve spontaneously but some require surgical drainage
