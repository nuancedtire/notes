Episcleritis is describes the acute onset of inflammation in the episclera of one or both eyes.  
  
The majority of cases are idiopathic, associated conditions include:  
* inflammatory bowel disease
* rheumatoid arthritis

  
Features  
* red eye
* classically not painful (in comparison to scleritis), but mild pain/irritation is common
* watering and mild photophobia may be present
* in episcleritis, the injected vessels are mobile when gentle pressure is applied on the sclera
	+ in scleritis, vessels are deeper, hence do not move
* phenylephrine drops may be used to differentiate between episcleritis and scleritis
	+ phenylephrine blanches the conjunctival and episcleral vessels but not the scleral vessels
	+ if the eye redness improves after phenylephrine a diagnosis of episcleritis can be made
* approximately 50% of cases are bilateral
