Keratitis describes inflammation of the cornea. Microbial keratitis is not like conjunctivitis \- it is potentially sight threatening and should therefore be urgently evaluated and treated.  
  
  
Aetiology
---------

  
Causes  
* bacterial
	+ typically *Staphylococcus aureus*
	+ *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is seen in contact lens wearers
* fungal
* amoebic
	+ acanthamoebic keratitis
	+ accounts for around 5% of cases
	+ increased incidence if eye exposure to soil or contaminated water
	+ pain is classically out of proportion to the findings
* parasitic: onchocercal keratitis ('river blindness')

  
Remember, other factors may causes keratitis:  
* viral: herpes simplex keratitis
* environmental
	+ photokeratitis: e.g. welder's arc eye
	+ exposure keratitis
	+ contact lens acute red eye (CLARE)

  
  
Clinical features
-----------------

  
Features  
* red eye: pain and erythema
* photophobia
* foreign body, gritty sensation
* hypopyon may be seen

  
  
Evaluation and management
-------------------------

  
Referral  
* contact lens wearers
	+ assessing contact lens wearers who present with a painful red eye is difficult
	+ an accurate diagnosis can only usually be made with a slit\-lamp, meaning same\-day referral to an eye specialist is usually required to rule out microbial keratitis

  
Management  
* stop using contact lens until the symptoms have fully resolved
* topical antibiotics
	+ typically quinolones are used first\-line
* cycloplegic for pain relief
	+ e.g. cyclopentolate

  
Complications may include:  
* corneal scarring
* perforation
* endophthalmitis
* visual loss
