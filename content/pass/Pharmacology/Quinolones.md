Quinolones are a group of antibiotics which work by inhibiting DNA synthesis and are bactericidal in nature. Examples include:  
* ciprofloxacin
* levofloxacin

  
Mechanism of action  
* inhibit topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV

  
Mechanism of resistance  
* mutations to DNA gyrase, efflux pumps which reduce intracellular quinolone concentration

  
Adverse effects  
* lower seizure threshold in patients with epilepsy
* tendon damage (including rupture) \- the risk is increased in patients also taking steroids
* cartilage damage has been demonstrated in animal models and for this reason quinolones are generally avoided (but not necessarily contraindicated) in children
* lengthens QT interval

  
Contraindications  
* Quinolones should generally be avoided in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding
* avoid in G6PD
