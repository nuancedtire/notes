Erythromycin was the first macrolide used clinically. Newer examples include clarithromycin and azithromycin.  
  
Macrolides act by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis by blocking translocation. If pushed to give an answer they are bacteriostatic in nature, but in reality this depends on the dose and type of organism being treated.  
  
Mechanism of resistance  
* post\-transcriptional methylation of the 23S bacterial ribosomal RNA

  
Adverse effects  
* prolongation of the QT interval
* gastrointestinal side\-effects are common. Nausea is less common with clarithromycin than erythromycin
* cholestatic jaundice: risk may be reduced if erythromycin stearate is used
* P450 inhibitor (see below)
* azithromycin is associated with hearing loss and tinnitus

  
Common interactions  
* statins should be stopped whilst taking a course of macrolides. Macrolides inhibit the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4 that metabolises statins. Taking macrolides concurrently with statins significantly increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.
