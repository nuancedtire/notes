Drugs which are known to cause impaired glucose tolerance include:  
* thiazides, furosemide (less common)
* steroids
* tacrolimus, ciclosporin
* interferon\-alpha
* nicotinic acid
* antipsychotics

  
Beta\-blockers cause a slight impairment of glucose tolerance. They should also be used with caution in diabetics as they can interfere with the metabolic and autonomic responses to hypoglycaemia
