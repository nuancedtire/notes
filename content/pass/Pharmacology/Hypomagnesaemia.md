Cause of low magnesium  
* drugs
	+ diuretics
	+ proton pump inhibitors
* total parenteral nutrition
* diarrhoea
	+ may occur with acute or chronic diarrhoea
* alcohol
* hypokalaemia
* hypercalcaemia
	+ e.g. secondary to hyperparathyroidism
	+ calcium and magnesium functionally compete for transport in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle
* metabolic disorders
	+ Gitleman's and Bartter's

  
Features may be similar to hypocalcaemia:  
* paraesthesia
* tetany
* seizures
* arrhythmias
* decreased PTH secretion â†’ hypocalcaemia
* ECG features similar to those of hypokalaemia
* exacerbates digoxin toxicity

  
Treatment
---------

  
\<0\.4 mmol/L or tetany, arrhythmias, or seizures  
* intravenous magnesium replacement is commonly given.
* an example regime would be 40 mmol of magnesium sulphate over 24 hours

  
\>0\.4 mmol/l  
* oral magnesium salts (10\-20 mmol orally per day in divided doses)
* diarrhoea can occur with oral magnesium salts
