There are two main types of heparin \- unfractionated, 'standard' heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). Heparins generally act by activating antithrombin III. Unfractionated heparin forms a complex which inhibits thrombin, factors Xa, IXa, XIa and XIIa. LMWH however only increases the action of antithrombin III on factor Xa  
  
Adverse effects of heparins include:  
* bleeding
* thrombocytopenia \- see below
* osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures
* hyperkalaemia \- this is thought to be caused by inhibition of aldosterone secretion

  
The table below shows the differences between standard heparin and LMWH:  
  


|  | **Standard heparin** | **Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Administration** | Intravenous | Subcutaneous |
| **Duration of action** | Short | Long |
| **Mechanism of action** | Activates antithrombin III. Forms a complex that inhibits thrombin, factors Xa, IXa, Xia and XIIa | Activates antithrombin III. Forms a complex that inhibits factor Xa |
| **Side\-effects** | BleedingHeparin\-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT)Osteoporosis | BleedingLower risk of HIT and osteoporosis with LMWH |
| **Monitoring** | Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) | Anti\-Factor Xa (although routine monitoring is not required) |
| **Notes** | Useful in situations where there is a high risk of bleeding as anticoagulation can be terminated rapidly. Also useful in renal failure | Now standard in the management of venous thromboembolism treatment and prophylaxis and acute coronary syndromes |

  
Heparin\-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT)  
* immune mediated \- antibodies form against complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4\) and heparin
* these antibodies bind to the PF4\-heparin complexes on the platelet surface and induce platelet activation by cross\-linking FcÎ³IIA receptors
* usually does not develop until after 5\-10 days of treatment
* despite being associated with low platelets HIT is actually a prothrombotic condition
* features include a greater than 50% reduction in platelets, thrombosis and skin allergy
* address need for ongoing anticoagulation:
	+ direct thrombin inhibitor e.g. argatroban
	+ danaparoid

  
Heparin overdose may be reversed by protamine sulphate, although this only partially reverses the effect of LMWH.
