Gentamicin is a type of aminoglycoside antibiotic. It is poorly lipid\-soluble and is therefore given parentally (e.g. for infective endocarditis) or topically (e.g. for otitis externa).  
  
Adverse effects  
* ototoxicity
	+ due to auditory or vestibular nerve damage
	+ irreversible
* nephrotoxicity
	+ accumulates in renal failure
	+ gentamicin is preferentially taken up by the proximal renal tubular cells. Once inside these cells, it can accumulate to toxic levels
	+ the toxicity is secondary to acute tubular necrosis
	+ concomitant use of furosemide increases the risk
	+ lower doses and more frequent monitoring is required

  
Contraindications  
* myasthenia gravis

  
Dosing  
* due to the significant ototoxic and nephrotoxic potential of gentamicin it is important to monitor plasma concentrations
* both peak (1 hour after administration) and trough levels (just before the next dose) are measured
* if the trough (pre\-dose) level is high the interval between the doses should be increased
* if the peak (post\-dose) level is high the dose should be decreased
