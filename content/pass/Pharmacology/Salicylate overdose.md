A key concept for the exam is to understand that salicylate overdose leads to a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. Early stimulation of the respiratory centre leads to a respiratory alkalosis whilst later the direct acid effects of salicylates (combined with acute renal failure) may lead to an acidosis. In children metabolic acidosis tends to predominate.  
  
Features  
* hyperventilation (centrally stimulates respiration)
* tinnitus
* lethargy
* sweating, pyrexia\*
* nausea/vomiting
* hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia
* seizures
* coma

  
Treatment  
* general (ABC, charcoal)
* urinary alkalinization with intravenous sodium bicarbonate \- enhances elimination of aspirin in the urine
* haemodialysis

  
Indications for haemodialysis in salicylate overdose  
* serum concentration \> 700mg/L
* metabolic acidosis resistant to treatment
* acute renal failure
* pulmonary oedema
* seizures
* coma

  
\*salicylates cause the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation leading to decreased adenosine triphosphate production, increased oxygen consumption and increased carbon dioxide and heat production
