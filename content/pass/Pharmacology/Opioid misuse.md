Opioids are substances which bind to opioid receptors. This includes both naturally occurring opiates such as morphine and synthetic opioids such as buprenorphine and methadone.  
  
Features of opioid misuse  
* rhinorrhoea
* needle track marks
* pinpoint pupils
* drowsiness
* watering eyes
* yawning

  
Complications of opioid misuse  
* viral infection secondary to sharing needles: HIV, hepatitis B \& C
* bacterial infection secondary to injection: infective endocarditis, septic arthritis, septicaemia, necrotising fasciitis
* venous thromboembolism
* overdose may lead to respiratory depression and death
* psychological problems: craving
* social problems: crime, prostitution, homelessness

  
Emergency management of opioid overdose  
* IV or IM naloxone: has a rapid onset and relatively short duration of action

  
Harm reduction interventions may include  
* needle exchange
* offering testing for HIV, hepatitis B \& C

  
Management of opioid dependence  
* patients are usually managed by specialist drug dependence clinics although some GPs with a specialist interest offer similar services
* patients may be offered maintenance therapy or detoxification
* NICE recommend methadone or buprenorphine as the first\-line treatment in opioid detoxification
	+ methadone is a full agonist of the mu\-opioid receptor \- binds to these receptors in the brain and fully activates them. This action can relieve withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Has a long half\-life
	+ buprenorphine is a partial agonist of the mu\-opioid receptor and an antagonist of the kappa\-opioid. It binds to the mu\-opioid receptors in the brain but only partially activates them. This partial activation is enough to alleviate cravings and withdrawal symptoms in individuals with opioid dependence. Furthermore, the binding of buprenorphine to the mu\-opioid receptor is very strong, or 'high affinity,' meaning it can displace other opioids from these receptors and prevent them from exerting their effects. As a kappa\-opioid receptor antagonist, buprenorphine may contribute to its ability to reduce symptoms of opioid withdrawal and potentially reduce depressive and dysphoric states.
* compliance is monitored using urinalysis
* detoxification should normally last up to 4 weeks in an inpatient/residential setting and up to 12 weeks in the community
