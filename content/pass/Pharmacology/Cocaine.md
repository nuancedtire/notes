Cocaine is an alkaloid derived from the coca plant. It is widely used as a recreational stimulant. The price of cocaine has fallen sharply in the past decade resulting in cocaine toxicity becoming a much more frequent clinical problem. This increase has made cocaine a favourite topic of question writers.  
  
Mechanism of action  
* cocaine blocks the uptake of dopamine, noradrenaline and serotonin

  
Adverse effects  
* cardiovascular
	+ coronary artery spasm â†’ myocardial ischaemia/infarction
	+ both tachycardia and bradycardia may occur
	+ hypertension
	+ QRS widening and QT prolongation
	+ aortic dissection
* neurological
	+ seizures
	+ mydriasis
	+ hypertonia
	+ hyperreflexia
* psychiatric effects
	+ agitation
	+ psychosis
	+ hallucinations
* others
	+ ischaemic colitis is recognised in patients following cocaine ingestion. This should be considered if patients complain of abdominal pain or rectal bleeding
	+ hyperthermia
	+ metabolic acidosis
	+ rhabdomyolysis

  
Management of cocaine toxicity  
* in general, benzodiazepines are generally first\-line for most cocaine\-related problems
* chest pain:
	+ benzodiazepines \+ glyceryl trinitrate
	+ if myocardial infarction develops then primary percutaneous coronary intervention
* hypertension: benzodiazepines \+ sodium nitroprusside
* the use of beta\-blockers in cocaine\-induced cardiovascular problems is a controversial issue
	+ the American Heart Association issued a statement in 2008 warning against the use of beta\-blockers (due to the risk of unopposed alpha\-mediated coronary vasospasm) but many cardiologists since have questioned whether this is valid
	+ if a reasonable alternative is given in an exam it is probably wise to choose it
