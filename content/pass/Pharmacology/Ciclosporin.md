Ciclosporin is an immunosuppressant which decreases clonal proliferation of T cells by reducing IL\-2 release. It acts by binding to cyclophilin forming a complex which inhibits calcineurin, a phosphatase that activates various transcription factors in T cells  
  
Adverse effects of ciclosporin (note how everything is increased \- fluid, BP, K\+, hair, gums, glucose)  
* nephrotoxicity
* hepatotoxicity
* fluid retention
* hypertension
* hyperkalaemia
* hypertrichosis
* gingival hyperplasia
* tremor
* impaired glucose tolerance
* hyperlipidaemia
* increased susceptibility to severe infection

  
Interestingly for an immunosuppressant, ciclosporin is noted by the BNF to be 'virtually non\-myelotoxic'.  
  
Notable interactions  
* cannabidiol: may increase the concentration of ciclosporin [BNF](https://bnf.nice.org.uk/interactions/ciclosporin/#:~:text=Cannabidiol-,Cannabidiol,-is%20predicted%20to "BNF - Ciclosporin")

  
Indications  
* following organ transplantation
* rheumatoid arthritis
* psoriasis (has a direct effect on keratinocytes as well as modulating T cell function)
* ulcerative colitis
* pure red cell aplasia
