Lithium is a mood stabilising drug used most commonly prophylactically in bipolar disorder but also as an adjunct in refractory depression. It has a very narrow therapeutic range (0\.4\-1\.0 mmol/L) and a long plasma half\-life being excreted primarily by the kidneys. Lithium toxicity generally occurs following concentrations \> 1\.5 mmol/L.   
  
Toxicity may be precipitated by:  
* dehydration
* renal failure
* drugs: diuretics (especially thiazides), ACE inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers, NSAIDs and metronidazole.

  
Features of toxicity  
* coarse tremor (a fine tremor is seen in therapeutic levels)
* hyperreflexia
* acute confusion
* polyuria
* seizure
* coma

  
Management  
* mild\-moderate toxicity may respond to volume resuscitation with normal saline
* haemodialysis may be needed in severe toxicity
* sodium bicarbonate is sometimes used but there is limited evidence to support this. By increasing the alkalinity of the urine it promotes lithium excretion
