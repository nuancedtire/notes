One of the effects of organophosphate poisoning is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase leading to upregulation of nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic neurotransmission. In warfare, sarin gas is a highly toxic synthetic organophosphorus compound that has similar effects.  
  
Features can be predicted by the accumulation of acetylcholine (mnemonic \= SLUD)   
* Salivation
* Lacrimation
* Urination
* Defecation/diarrhoea
* cardiovascular: hypotension, bradycardia
* also: small pupils, muscle fasciculation

  
Management  
* atropine
* the role of pralidoxime is still unclear \- meta\-analyses to date have failed to show any clear benefit
