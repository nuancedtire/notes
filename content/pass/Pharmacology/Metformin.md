Metformin is a biguanide used mainly in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It has a number of actions which improves glucose tolerance (see below). Unlike sulphonylureas it does not cause hypoglycaemia and weight gain and is therefore first\-line, particularly if the patient is overweight. Metformin is also used in polycystic ovarian syndrome and non\-alcoholic fatty liver disease  
  
Mechanism of action  
* acts by activation of the AMP\-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
* increases insulin sensitivity
* decreases hepatic gluconeogenesis
* may also reduce gastrointestinal absorption of carbohydrates

  
Adverse effects   
* gastrointestinal upsets are common (nausea, anorexia, diarrhoea), intolerable in 20%
* reduced vitamin B12 absorption \- rarely a clinical problem
* lactic acidosis with severe liver disease or renal failure
	+ it is now increasingly recognised that lactic acidosis secondary to metformin is rare, although it remains important in the context of exams

  
Contraindications  
* chronic kidney disease: NICE recommend that the dose should be reviewed if the creatinine is \> 130 µmol/l (or eGFR \< 45 ml/min) and stopped if the creatinine is \> 150 µmol/l (or eGFR \< 30 ml/min)
* metformin may cause lactic acidosis if taken during a period where there is tissue hypoxia. Examples include a recent myocardial infarction, sepsis, acute kidney injury and severe dehydration
* iodine\-containing x\-ray contrast media: examples include peripheral arterial angiography, coronary angiography, intravenous pyelography (IVP); there is an increasing risk of provoking renal impairment due to contrast nephropathy; metformin should be discontinued on the day of the procedure and for 48 hours thereafter
* alcohol abuse is a relative contraindication

  
Starting metformin  
* metformin should be titrated up slowly to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side\-effects
* if patients develop unacceptable side\-effects then modified\-release metformin should be considered
