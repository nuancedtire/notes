Rifampicin  
* mechanism of action: inhibits bacterial DNA dependent RNA polymerase preventing transcription of DNA into mRNA
* potent liver enzyme inducer
* hepatitis, orange secretions
* flu\-like symptoms

  
Isoniazid  
* mechanism of action: inhibits mycolic acid synthesis
* peripheral neuropathy: prevent with pyridoxine (Vitamin B6\)
* hepatitis, agranulocytosis
* liver enzyme inhibitor

  
Pyrazinamide  
* mechanism of action: converted by pyrazinamidase into pyrazinoic acid which in turn inhibits fatty acid synthase (FAS) I
* hyperuricaemia causing gout
* arthralgia, myalgia
* hepatitis

  
Ethambutol  
* mechanism of action: inhibits the enzyme arabinosyl transferase which polymerizes arabinose into arabinan
* optic neuritis: check visual acuity before and during treatment
* dose needs adjusting in patients with renal impairment
