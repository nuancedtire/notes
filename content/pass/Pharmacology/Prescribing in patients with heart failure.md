The following medications may exacerbate heart failure:  
* thiazolidinediones
	+ pioglitazone is contraindicated as it causes fluid retention
* verapamil
	+ negative inotropic effect
* NSAIDs/glucocorticoids
	+ should be used with caution as they cause fluid retention
	+ low\-dose aspirin is an exception \- many patients will have coexistent cardiovascular disease and the benefits of taking aspirin easily outweigh the risks
* class I antiarrhythmics
	+ flecainide (negative inotropic and proarrhythmic effect)
