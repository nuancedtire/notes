Allopurinol is used in the prevention of gout. It works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase.  
  
Initiating allopurinol prophylaxis  
* it has traditionally been taught that urate\-lowering therapy (ULT) should not be started until 2 weeks after an acute attack, as starting too early may precipitate a further attack. The evidence base to support this however looks weak
* in 2017 the BSR updated their guidelines. They still support a delay in starting urate\-lowering therapy because it is better for a patient to make long\-term drug decisions whilst not in pain
	+ the key passage is: *'Commencement of ULT is best delayed until inflammation has settled as ULT is better discussed when the patient is not in pain'*
* initial dose of 100 mg od, with the dose titrated every few weeks to aim for a serum uric acid of \< 300 Âµmol/l. Lower initial doses should be given if the patient has a reduced eGFR
* colchicine cover should be considered when starting allopurinol. NSAIDs can be used if colchicine cannot be tolerated. The BSR guidelines suggest this may need to be continued for 6 months

  
Indications for allopurinol  
* the British Society of Rheumatology Guidelines now advocate offering urate\-lowering therapy to all patients after their **first attack of gout**
* ULT is *particularly* recommended if:
	+ \>\= 2 attacks in 12 months
	+ tophi
	+ renal disease
	+ uric acid renal stones
	+ prophylaxis if on cytotoxics or diuretics
* patients with Lesch\-Nyhan syndrome often take allopurinol for life

  
  
Adverse effects
---------------

  
The most significant adverse effects are dermatological and patients should be warned to stop allopurinol immediately if they develop a rash:  
* severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR)
* drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)
* Stevens\-Johnson syndrome

  
Certain ethnic groups such as the Chinese, Korean and Thai people seem to be at an increased risk of these dermatological reactions.  
  
Patients at a high risk of severe cutaneous adverse reaction should be screened for the HLA\-B \*5801 allele.  
  
  
Interactions
------------

  
Azathioprine  
* metabolised to active compound 6\-mercaptopurine
* xanthine oxidase is responsible for the oxidation of 6\-mercaptopurine to 6\-thiouric acid
* allopurinol can therefore lead to high levels of 6\-mercaptopurine
* a much reduced dose (e.g. 25%) must therefore be used if the combination cannot be avoided

  
Cyclophosphamide  
* allopurinol reduces renal clearance, therefore may cause marrow toxicity

  
Theophylline  
* allopurinol causes an increase in plasma concentration of theophylline by inhibiting its breakdown
