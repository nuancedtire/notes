Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) involves the use of a small dose of oestrogen, combined with a progestogen (in women with a uterus), to help alleviate menopausal symptoms.   
  
The indications for HRT have changed significantly over the past ten years as the long\-term risks became apparent, primarily as a result of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study.   
  
Indications  
* vasomotor symptoms such as flushing, insomnia and headaches
	+ this is considered the most important factor in choosing whether to start HRT, rather than other possible health benefits such as increased bone mineral density
	+ other indications such as reversal of vaginal atrophy should be treated with other agents as first\-line therapies
* premature menopause
	+ should be continued until the age of 50 years
	+ the most important reason in giving HRT to younger women is preventing the development of osteoporosis

  
Other benefits include a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer.  
  
Types of HRT
------------

  
HRT generally consists of an oestrogenic compound, which replaces the diminished levels that occur in the perimenopausal period. This is normally combined with a progestogen if a woman has a uterus to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer.  
  
Choice of hormone  
* oestrogens
	+ 'natural' oestrogens such as estradiol, estrone and conjugated oestrogen are generally used rather than synthetic oestrogens such as ethinylestradiol (which is used in the combined oral contraceptive pill)
* progestogens
	+ 'synthetic' progestogens such as medroxyprogesterone, norethisterone, levonorgestrel, and drospirenone are usually used
	+ a levonorgestrel\-releasing intrauterine system (e.g. Mirena) may be used as the progestogen component of HRT, i.e. a woman could take an oral oestrogen and have endometrial protection using a Mirena coil
* tibolone
	+ synthetic compound with both oestrogenic, progestogenic, and androgenic activity

  
Route  
* HRT can be taken orally or transdermally (via a patch or gel)
* transdermal is preferred if the woman is at risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), as the rates of VTE do not appear to rise with transdermal preparations
