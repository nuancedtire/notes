Potassium\-sparing diuretics may be divided into the epithelial sodium channel blockers (amiloride and triamterene) and aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone and eplerenone).  
  
They should be used with caution in patients taking ACE inhibitors as they precipitate hyperkalaemia.  
  
**Amiloride**   
* blocks the epithelial sodium channel in the distal convoluted tubule
* weak diuretic, usually given with thiazides or loop diuretics as an alternative to potassium supplementation (remember that thiazides and loop diuretics often cause hypokalaemia)

  
**Aldosterone antagonists** e.g. spironolactone  
* acts in the cortical collecting duct
* indications
	+ ascites: patients with cirrhosis develop a secondary hyperaldosteronism. Relatively large doses such as 100 or 200mg are often used
	+ heart failure
	+ nephrotic syndrome
	+ Conn's syndrome
