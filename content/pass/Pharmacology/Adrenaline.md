Adrenaline is a sympathomimetic amine with both alpha and beta adrenergic stimulating properties  
  
Indications  
* anaphylaxis
* cardiac arrest

  
Recommend Adult Life Support (ALS) adrenaline doses  
* anaphylaxis: 0\.5ml 1:1,000 IM
* cardiac arrest: 10ml 1:10,000 IV or 1ml of 1:1000 IV

  
Management of accidental injection e.g. resulting in digital ischaemia  
* local infiltration of phentolamine

  
Background  
* responsible for the fight or flight response
* released by the adrenal glands
* acts on α 1 and 2, β 1 and 2 receptors
* acts on β 2 receptors in skeletal muscle vessels\-causing vasodilation
* increases cardiac output and total peripheral resistance
* causes vasoconstriction in the skin and kidneys causing a **narrow pulse pressure**

   
Actions on α adrenergic receptors:   
* inhibits insulin secretion by the pancreas
* stimulates glycogenolysis in the liver and muscle
* stimulates glycolysis in muscle

  
Actions onβ adrenergic receptors:  
* stimulates glucagon secretion in the pancreas
* stimulates ACTH
* stimulates lipolysis by adipose tissue
