Around 1 in 6 patients taking amiodarone develop thyroid dysfunction  
  
Amiodarone\-induced hypothyroidism
----------------------------------

  
The pathophysiology of amiodarone\-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) is thought to be due to the high iodine content of amiodarone causing a Wolff\-Chaikoff effect\*  
  
Amiodarone may be continued if this is desirable  
  
Amiodarone\-induced thyrotoxicosis
----------------------------------

  
Amiodarone\-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may be divided into two types:  
  


|  | **AIT type 1** | **AIT type 2** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pathophysiology | Excess iodine\-induced thyroid hormone synthesis | Amiodarone\-related destructive thyroiditis |
| Goitre | Present | Absent |
| Management | Carbimazole or potassium perchlorate | Corticosteroids |

  
Unlike in AIH, amiodarone should be stopped if possible in patients who develop AIT  
  
\*an autoregulatory phenomenon where thyroxine formation is inhibited due to high levels of circulating iodide
