The following is based on 2012 Commission on Human Medicines (CHM) review of paracetamol overdose management. The big change in these guidelines was the removal of the 'high\-risk' treatment line on the normogram. All patients are therefore treated the same regardless of risk factors for hepatotoxicity. The National Poisons Information Service/TOXBASE should always be consulted for situations outside of the normal parameters.  
  
The minority of patients who present within 1 hour may benefit from activated charcoal to reduce absorption of the drug.  
  
Acetylcysteine should be given if:  
* the plasma paracetamol concentration is on or above a single treatment line joining points of 100 mg/L at 4 hours and 15 mg/L at 15 hours, regardless of risk factors of hepatotoxicity
* there is a staggered overdose\* or there is doubt over the time of paracetamol ingestion, regardless of the plasma paracetamol concentration; or
* patients who present 8\-24 hours after ingestion of an acute overdose of more than 150 mg/kg of paracetamol even if the plasma\-paracetamol concentration is not yet available
* patients who present \> 24 hours if they are clearly jaundiced or have hepatic tenderness, their ALT is above the upper limit of normal
	+ acetylcysteine should be continued if the paracetamol concentration or ALT remains elevated whilst seeking specialist advice

  
Acetylcysteine is now infused over 1 hour (rather than the previous 15 minutes) to reduce the number of adverse effects. Acetylcysteine commonly causes an anaphylactoid reaction (non\-IgE mediated mast cell release). Anaphylactoid reactions to IV acetylcysteine are generally treated by stopping the infusion, then restarting at a slower rate.
