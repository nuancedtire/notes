Mefloquine (brand name Lariam) is used for both the prophylaxis and treatment of certain types of malaria. There has long been a concern about the neuropsychiatric side\-effects of mefloquine. A recent review has however led to 'strengthened warnings' about the potential risks.  
  
The following advice is therefore given:  
* certain side\-effects such nightmares or anxiety may be 'prodromal' of a more serious neuropsychiatric event
* suicide and deliberate self harm have been reported in patients taking mefloquine
* adverse reactions may continue for several months due to the long half\-life or mefloquine
* mefloquine should not be used in patients with a history of anxiety, depression schizophrenia or other psychiatric disorders
* patients who experience neuropsychiatric sife\-effects should stop mefloquine and seek medical advice
