Overdose of tricyclic antidepressants is a common presentation to emergency departments. Amitriptyline and dosulepin (dothiepin) are particularly dangerous in overdose.  
  
Early features relate to anticholinergic properties: dry mouth, dilated pupils, agitation, sinus tachycardia, blurred vision.  
  
Features of severe poisoning include:  
* arrhythmias
* seizures
* metabolic acidosis
* coma

  
ECG changes include:  
* sinus tachycardia
* widening of QRS
* prolongation of QT interval

  
Widening of QRS \> 100ms is associated with an increased risk of seizures whilst QRS \> 160ms is associated with ventricular arrhythmias

Management  
* IV bicarbonate
	+ first\-line therapy for hypotension or arrhythmias
	+ indications include widening of the QRS interval \>100 msec or a ventricular arrhythmia
* other drugs for arrhythmias

 \+ class 1a (e.g. quinidine) and class Ic antiarrhythmics (e.g. Flecainide) are contraindicated as they prolong depolarisation  
* class III drugs such as amiodarone should also be avoided as they prolong the QT interval
* response to lignocaine is variable and it should be emphasized that correction of acidosis is the first line in the management of tricyclic\-induced arrhythmias

- intravenous lipid emulsion is increasingly used to bind free drug and reduce toxicity
- dialysis is ineffective in removing tricyclics
