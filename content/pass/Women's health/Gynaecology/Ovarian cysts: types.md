Benign ovarian cysts are extremely common. They may be divided into physiological cysts, benign germ cell tumours, benign epithelial tumours and benign sex cord stromal tumours.  
  
Complex (i.e. multi\-loculated) ovarian cysts should be biopsied to exclude malignancy.  
  
Physiological cysts (functional cysts)
--------------------------------------

  
Follicular cysts  
* commonest type of ovarian cyst
* due to non\-rupture of the dominant follicle or failure of atresia in a non\-dominant follicle
* commonly regress after several menstrual cycles

  
Corpus luteum cyst  
* during the menstrual cycle if pregnancy doesn't occur the corpus luteum usually breaks down and disappears. If this doesn't occur the corpus luteum may fill with blood or fluid and form a corpus luteal cyst
* more likely to present with intraperitoneal bleeding than follicular cysts

  
Benign germ cell tumours
------------------------

  
Dermoid cyst  
* also called mature cystic teratomas. Usually lined with epithelial tissue and hence may contain skin appendages, hair and teeth
* most common benign ovarian tumour in woman under the age of 30 years
* median age of diagnosis is 30 years old
* bilateral in 10\-20%
* usually asymptomatic. Torsion is more likely than with other ovarian tumours

  
Benign epithelial tumours
-------------------------

  
Arise from the ovarian surface epithelium  
  
Serous cystadenoma  
* the most common benign epithelial tumour which bears a resemblance to the most common type of ovarian cancer (serous carcinoma)
* bilateral in around 20%

  
Mucinous cystadenoma  
* second most common benign epithelial tumour
* they are typically large and may become massive
* if ruptures may cause pseudomyxoma peritonei
