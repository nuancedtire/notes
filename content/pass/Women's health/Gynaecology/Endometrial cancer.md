Endometrial cancer is classically seen in post\-menopausal women but around 25% of cases occur before the menopause. It usually carries a good prognosis due to early detection  
  
Aetiology
---------

  
Risk factors  
* excess oestrogen
	+ nulliparity
	+ early menarche
	+ late menopause
	+ unopposed oestrogen. The addition of a progestogen to oestrogen reduces this risk (e.g. In HRT). The BNF states that the additional risk is eliminated if a progestogen is given continuously
* metabolic syndrome
	+ obesity
	+ diabetes mellitus
	+ polycystic ovarian syndrome
* tamoxifen
* hereditary non\-polyposis colorectal carcinoma

  
Protective factors  
* multiparity
* combined oral contraceptive pill
* smoking (the reasons for this are unclear)

  
Features
--------

  
The classic symptom is **postmenopausal bleeding**  
* usually slight and intermittent initially before becoming heavier

  
Other features  
* premenopausal women may develop menorrhagia or intermenstrual bleeding
* pain is not common and typically signifies extensive disease
* vaginal discharge is unusual

  
Investigations
--------------

  
All women \>\= 55 years who present with postmenopausal bleeding should be referred using the suspected cancer pathway  
* first\-line investigation is trans\-vaginal ultrasound \- a normal endometrial thickness (\< 4 mm) has a high negative predictive value
* hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy

  
Management
----------

  
The mainstay of management for endometrial cancer is **surgery.**  
* localised disease is treated with total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo\-oophorectomy
* patients with high\-risk disease may have postoperative radiotherapy

  
Progestogen therapy is sometimes used in frail elderly women not considered suitable for surgery.
