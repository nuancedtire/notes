Implantation of a fertilized ovum outside the uterus results in an ectopic pregnancy  
  
A typical history is a female with a history of 6\-8 weeks amenorrhoea who presents with lower abdominal pain and later develops vaginal bleeding  
* lower abdominal pain
	+ due to tubal spasm
	+ typically the first symptom
	+ pain is usually constant and may be unilateral.
* vaginal bleeding
	+ usually less than a normal period
	+ may be dark brown in colour
* history of recent amenorrhoea
	+ typically 6\-8 weeks from the start of last period
	+ if longer (e.g. 10 wks) this suggest another causes e.g. inevitable abortion
* peritoneal bleeding can cause shoulder tip pain and pain on defecation / urination
* dizziness, fainting or syncope may be seen
* symptoms of pregnancy such as breast tenderness may also be reported

  
Examination findings  
* abdominal tenderness
* cervical excitation (also known as cervical motion tenderness)
* adnexal mass: NICE advise NOT to examine for an adnexal mass due to an increased risk of rupturing the pregnancy. A pelvic examination to check for cervical excitation is however recommended

  
In the case of pregnancy of unknown location, serum bHCG levels \>1,500 points toward a diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy
