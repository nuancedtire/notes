In the 2023 NICE guidelines, 3 types of management for miscarriage were discussed:  
  
Expectant management  
* 'Waiting for a spontaneous miscarriage'
* First\-line and involves waiting for 7\-14 days for the miscarriage to complete spontaneously
* If expectant management is unsuccessful then medical or surgical management may be offered

  
Some situations are better managed medically or surgically. NICE list the following:  
* increased risk of haemorrhage
	+ she is in the late first trimester
	+ if she has coagulopathies or is unable to have a blood transfusion
* previous adverse and/or traumatic experience associated with pregnancy (for example, stillbirth, miscarriage or antepartum haemorrhage)
* evidence of infection

  
Medical management:  
* missed miscarriage
	+ oral mifepristone. Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist → weakening of attachment to the endometrial wall \+ cervical softening and dilation \+ induction of uterine contractions
	+ 48 hours later, misoprostol (vaginal, oral or sublingual) unless the gestational sac has already been passed. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analogue, binds to myometrial cells → strong myometrial contractions → expulsion of products of conception
	+ if bleeding has not started within 48 hours after misoprostol treatment, they should contact their healthcare professional
* incomplete miscarriage
	+ a single dose of misoprostol (vaginal, oral or sublingual)
* women should be offered antiemetics and pain relief
* a pregnancy test should be performed at 3 weeks

  
Surgical management  
* 'Undergoing a surgical procedure under local or general anaesthetic'
* The two main options are vacuum aspiration (suction curettage) or surgical management in theatre
* Vacuum aspiration is done under local anaesthetic as an outpatient

 \- Surgical management is done in theatre under general anaesthetic. This was previously referred to as 'Evacuation of retained products of conception'
