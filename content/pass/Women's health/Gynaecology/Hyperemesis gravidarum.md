Whilst the majority of women experience nausea (previously termed 'morning sickness') during the early stages of pregnancy it can become problematic in a minority of cases. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) now use the term 'nausea and vomiting of pregnancy' (NVP) to describe troublesome symptoms, with hyperemesis gravidarum being the extreme form of this condition.   
  
It occurs in around 1% of pregnancies and is thought to be related to raised beta hCG levels. Hyperemesis gravidarum is most common between 8 and 12 weeks but may persist up to 20 weeks.  
  
Risk factors  
* increased levels of beta\-hCG
	+ multiple pregnancies
	+ trophoblastic disease
* nulliparity
* obesity
* family or personal history of NVP

  
Smoking is associated with a decreased incidence of hyperemesis.  
  
  
Referral criteria for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy
------------------------------------------------------

  
NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries recommend considering admission in the following situations: [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/management/management/#:~:text=When%20should%20I%20arrange%20admission%20or%20referral%3F "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - CKS - NICE vomiting in pregnancy guidance summary")   
* Continued nausea and vomiting and is unable to keep down liquids or oral antiemetics
* Continued nausea and vomiting with ketonuria and/or weight loss (greater than 5% of body weight), despite treatment with oral antiemetics
* A confirmed or suspected comorbidity (for example she is unable to tolerate oral antibiotics for a urinary tract infection)

  
They also recommend having a lower threshold for admission to hospital if the woman has a co\-existing condition (for example diabetes) that may be adversely affected by nausea and vomiting.   
  
  
Hyperemesis gravidarum
----------------------

  
The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) recommend that the following triad is present before diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum: [RCOG](https://www.rcog.org.uk/media/y3fen1x1/gtg69-hyperemesis.pdf#page=2 "Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists - 2016 The Management of Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy and Hyperemesis Gravidarum")   
* 5% pre\-pregnancy weight loss
* dehydration
* electrolyte imbalance

  
Validated scoring systems such as the Pregnancy\-Unique Quantification of Emesis (PUQE) score can be used to classify the severity of NVP.  
  
Management  
* simple measures
	+ rest and avoid triggers e.g. odours
	+ bland, plain food, particularly in the morning
	+ ginger
	+ P6 (wrist) acupressure
* first\-line medications [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/management/management/#:~:text=Which%20drug%20treatments%20should%20I%20offer%3F "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - CKS - NICE vomiting in pregnancy guidance summary")
	+ antihistamines: oral cyclizine or promethazine
	+ phenothiazines: oral prochlorperazine or chlorpromazine
	+ combination drug doxylamine/pyridoxine: pyridoxine (vitamin B6\) monotherapy is actually used commonly outside of the UK as a first\-line treatment for NVP. However, pyridoxine monotherapy is specifically not recommended in the RCOG guidelines
* second\-line medications
	+ oral ondansetron: ondansetron during the first trimester is associated with a small increased risk of the baby having a cleft lip/palate. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advise that if ondansetron is used then these risks should be discussed with the pregnant woman
	+ oral metoclopramide or domperidone: metoclopramide may cause extrapyramidal side effects. It should therefore not be used for more than 5 days
* admission may be needed for IV hydration
	+ see criteria above for referral/admission
	+ normal saline with added potassium is used to rehydrate

  
Women with hyperemesis gravidarum may develop dehydration, weight loss and electrolyte imbalances. Other complications include:  
* acute kidney injury
* Wernicke's encephalopathy
* oesophagitis, Mallory\-Weiss tear
* venous thromboembolism
* fetal outcome [CKS](https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/nausea-vomiting-in-pregnancy/background-information/complications/#:~:text=ACOG%2C%202018%5D.-,Fetal%20complications,-Women%20with%20mild "Clinical Knowledge Summaries - CKS - NICE vomiting in pregnancy guidance summary")
	+ studies generally show little evidence of adverse outcomes for birth weight/other markers for mild\-moderate symptoms
	+ severe NVP resulting in multiple admissions and failure to 'catch\-up' weight gain may be linked to a small increase in preterm birth and low birth weight
