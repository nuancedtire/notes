Premature ovarian insufficiency is defined as the onset of menopausal symptoms and elevated gonadotrophin levels before the age of 40 years. It occurs in around 1 in 100 women.  
  
Causes of premature menopause include:  
* idiopathic
	+ the most common cause
	+ there may be a family history
* bilateral oophorectomy
	+ having a hysterectomy with preservation of the ovaries has also been shown to advance the age of menopause
* radiotherapy
* chemotherapy
* infection: e.g. mumps
* autoimmune disorders
* resistant ovary syndrome: due to FSH receptor abnormalities

  
Features are similar to those of the normal climacteric but the actual presenting problem may differ  
* climacteric symptoms: hot flushes, night sweats
* infertility
* secondary amenorrhoea
* raised FSH, LH levels
	+ e.g. FSH \> 30 IU/L
	+ elevated FSH levels should be demonstrated on 2 blood samples taken 4\-6 weeks apart
* low oestradiol
	+ e.g. \< 100 pmol/l

  
Management  
* hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or a combined oral contraceptive pill should be offered to women until the age of the average menopause (51 years)
	+ it should be noted that HRT does not provide contraception, in case spontaneous ovarian activity resumes
