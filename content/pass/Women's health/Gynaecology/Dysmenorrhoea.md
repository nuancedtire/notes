Dysmenorrhoea is characterised by excessive pain during the menstrual period. It is traditionally divided into primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea.  
  
Primary dysmenorrhoea
---------------------

  
In primary dysmenorrhoea there is no underlying pelvic pathology. It affects up to 50% of menstruating women and usually appears within 1\-2 years of the menarche. Excessive endometrial prostaglandin production is thought to be partially responsible.  
  
Features  
* pain typically starts just before or within a few hours of the period starting
* suprapubic cramping pains which may radiate to the back or down the thigh

  
Management  
* NSAIDs such as mefenamic acid and ibuprofen are effective in up to 80% of women. They work by inhibiting prostaglandin production
* combined oral contraceptive pills are used second line

  
Secondary dysmenorrhoea
-----------------------

  
Secondary dysmenorrhoea typically develops many years after the menarche and is the result of an underlying pathology. In contrast to primary dysmenorrhoea the pain usually starts 3\-4 days before the onset of the period. Causes include:  
* endometriosis
* adenomyosis
* pelvic inflammatory disease
* intrauterine devices\*
* fibroids

  
Clinical Knowledge Summaries recommend referring all patients with secondary dysmenorrhoea to gynaecology for investigation.
