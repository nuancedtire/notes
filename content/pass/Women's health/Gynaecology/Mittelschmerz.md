Mittelschmerz literally translates to 'middle pain' and refers to abdominal pain associated with ovulation. This mid\-cyclical pain is experienced by 20% of women and there are several theories as to why it occurs. One explanation is that is occurs due to a leakage of follicular fluid containing prostaglandins at the time of ovulation, which causes the pain. Another explanation is that the growth of the follicle stretches the surface of the ovary, causing pain.
