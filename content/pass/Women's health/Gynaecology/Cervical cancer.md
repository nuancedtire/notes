Around 50% of cases of cervical cancer occur in women under the age of 45 years, with incidence rates for cervical cancer in the UK are highest in people aged 25\-29 years, according to Cancer Research UK. It may be divided into:  
* squamous cell cancer (80%)
* adenocarcinoma (20%)

  
Features  
* may be detected during routine cervical cancer screening
* abnormal vaginal bleeding: postcoital, intermenstrual or postmenopausal bleeding
* vaginal discharge

  
**Human papillomavirus (HPV)**, particularly serotypes 16,18 \& 33 is by far the most important factor in the development of cervical cancer. Other risk factors include:  
* smoking
* human immunodeficiency virus
* early first intercourse, many sexual partners
* high parity
* lower socioeconomic status
* combined oral contraceptive pill\*

  
Mechanism of HPV causing cervical cancer  
* HPV 16 \& 18 produces the oncogenes E6 and E7 genes respectively
* E6 inhibits the p53 tumour suppressor gene
* E7 inhibits RB suppressor gene

  
\*the strength of this association is sometimes debated but a large study published in the Lancet (2007 Nov 10;370(9599\):1609\-21\) confirmed the link
