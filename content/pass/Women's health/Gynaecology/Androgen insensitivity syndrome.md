Androgen insensitivity syndrome is an X\-linked recessive condition due to end\-organ resistance to testosterone causing genotypically male children (46XY) to have a female phenotype. Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome is the new term for testicular feminisation syndrome  
  
Features  
* 'primary amenorrhoea'
* little or no axillary and pubic hair
* undescended testes causing groin swellings
* breast development may occur as a result of the conversion of testosterone to oestradiol

  
Diagnosis  
* buccal smear or chromosomal analysis to reveal 46XY genotype
* after puberty, testosterone concentrations are in the high\-normal to slightly elevated reference range for postpubertal boys

  
Management  
* counselling \- raise the child as female
* bilateral orchidectomy (increased risk of testicular cancer due to undescended testes)
* oestrogen therapy
