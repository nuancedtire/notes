Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex condition of ovarian dysfunction thought to affect between 5\-20% of women of reproductive age. The aetiology of PCOS is not fully understood. Both hyperinsulinaemia and high levels of luteinizing hormone are seen in PCOS and there appears to be some overlap with the metabolic syndrome.  
  
Features  
* subfertility and infertility
* menstrual disturbances: oligomenorrhoea and amenorrhoea
* hirsutism, acne (due to hyperandrogenism)
* obesity
* acanthosis nigricans (due to insulin resistance)

  
Investigations  
* pelvic ultrasound: multiple cysts on the ovaries
* NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries recommend the following baseline investigatons: FSH, LH, prolactin, TSH, testosterone, sex hormone\-binding globulin (SHBG) are useful investigations
	+ raised LH:FSH ratio is a 'classical' feature but is no longer thought to be useful in diagnosis
	+ prolactin may be normal or mildly elevated
	+ testosterone may be normal or mildly elevated \- however, if markedly raised consider other causes
	+ SHBG is normal to low in women with PCOS
* check for impaired glucose tolerance

  
Diagnostic criteria  
* a formal diagnosis should only be made after performing investigations to exclude other conditions
* the Rotterdam criteria state that a diagnosis of PCOS can be made if 2 of the following 3 are present:
	+ infrequent or no ovulation (usually manifested as infrequent or no menstruation)
	+ clinical and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism (such as hirsutism, acne, or elevated levels of total or free testosterone)
	+ polycystic ovaries on ultrasound scan (defined as the presence of ≥ 12 follicles (measuring 2\-9 mm in diameter) in one or both ovaries and/or increased ovarian volume \> 10 cm³)
