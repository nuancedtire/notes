Fibroids are benign smooth muscle tumours of the uterus. They are thought to occur in around 20% of white and around 50% of black women in the later reproductive years.  
  
Associations  
* more common in Afro\-Caribbean women
* rare before puberty, develop in response to oestrogen

  
Features  
* may be asymptomatic
* menorrhagia
	+ may result in iron\-deficiency anaemia
* bulk\-related symptoms
	+ lower abdominal pain: cramping pains, often during menstruation
	+ bloating
	+ urinary symptoms, e.g. frequency, may occur with larger fibroids
* subfertility
* rare features:
	+ polycythaemia secondary to autonomous production of erythropoietin

  
Diagnosis  
* transvaginal ultrasound

  
Management
----------

  
Asymptomatic fibroids  
* no treatment is needed other than periodic review to monitor size and growth

  
Management of menorrhagia secondary to fibroids  
* levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG\-IUS)
	+ useful if the woman also requires contraception
	+ cannot be used if there is distortion of the uterine cavity
* NSAIDs e.g. mefenamic acid
* tranexamic acid
* combined oral contraceptive pill
* oral progestogen
* injectable progestogen

  
Treatment to shrink/remove fibroids  
* medical
	+ GnRH agonists may reduce the size of the fibroid but are typically used more for short\-term treatment due to side\-effects such as menopausal symptoms (hot flushes, vaginal dryness) and loss of bone mineral density
	+ ulipristal acetate has been in the past but not currently due to concerns about rare but serious liver toxicity
* surgical
	+ myomectomy: this may be performed abdominally, laparoscopically or hysteroscopically
	+ hysteroscopic endometrial ablation
	+ hysterectomy
* uterine artery embolization

  
Prognosis and complications
---------------------------

  
Fibroids generally regress after the menopause.  
  
Some of the complications such as subfertility and iron\-deficiency anaemia have been mentioned previously.  
  
Other complications  
* red degeneration \- haemorrhage into tumour \- commonly occurs during pregnancy
