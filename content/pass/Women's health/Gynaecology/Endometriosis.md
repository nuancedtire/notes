Endometriosis is a common condition characterised by the growth of ectopic endometrial tissue outside of the uterine cavity. Around 10% of women of reproductive age have a degree of endometriosis.  
  
Clinical features  
* chronic pelvic pain
* secondary dysmenorrhoea
	+ pain often starts days before bleeding
* deep dyspareunia
* subfertility
* non\-gynaecological: urinary symptoms e.g. dysuria, urgency, haematuria. Dyschezia (painful bowel movements)
* on pelvic examination reduced organ mobility, tender nodularity in the posterior vaginal fornix and visible vaginal endometriotic lesions may be seen

  
Investigation  
* **laparoscopy is the gold\-standard investigation**
* there is little role for investigation in primary care (e.g. ultrasound)\- if the symptoms are significant the patient should be referred for a definitive diagnosis

  
Management depends on clinical features \- there is poor correlation between laparoscopic findings and severity of symptoms. NICE published guidelines in 2017:  
* **NSAIDs and/or paracetamol** are the recommended first\-line treatments for symptomatic relief
* if analgesia doesn't help then hormonal treatments such as the **combined oral contraceptive pill or progestogens** e.g. medroxyprogesterone acetate should be tried

  
If analgesia/hormonal treatment does not improve symptoms, or if fertility is a priority, the patient should be referred to secondary care. Secondary treatments include:  
* GnRH analogues \- said to induce a 'pseudomenopause' due to the low oestrogen levels
* drug therapy unfortunately does not seem to have a significant impact on fertility rates
* surgery
	+ this may be an option for women who have not responded to conventional medical treatment
	+ for women who are trying to conceive, NICE recommend laparoscopic excision or ablation of endometriosis plus adhesiolysis as this has been shown to improve the chances of conception. Ovarian cystectomy (for endometriomas) is also recommended
