| Expectant management involves closely monitoring the patient over 48 hours and if B\-hCG levels rise again or symptoms manifest intervention is performed. | Medical management involves giving the patient methotrexate and can only be done if the patient is willing to attend follow\-up. | Surgical management can involve salpingectomy or salpingotomySalpingectomy is first\-line for women with no other risk factors for infertilitySalpingotomy should be considered for women with risk factors for infertility such as contralateral tube damage* around 1 in 5 women who undergo a salpingotomy require further treatment (methotrexate and/or a salpingectomy) |
