Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) involves the use of a small dose of oestrogen (combined with a progestogen in women with a uterus) to help alleviate menopausal symptoms.  
  
Side\-effects  
* nausea
* breast tenderness
* fluid retention and weight gain

  
Potential complications  
* increased risk of breast cancer
	+ increased by the addition of a progestogen
	+ in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study there was a relative risk of 1\.26 at 5 years of developing breast cancer
	+ the increased risk relates to the duration of use
	+ the risk of breast cancer begins to decline when HRT is stopped and by 5 years it reaches the same level as in women who have never taken HRT
* increased risk of endometrial cancer
	+ oestrogen by itself should not be given as HRT to women with a womb
	+ reduced by the addition of a progestogen but not eliminated completely
	+ the BNF states that the additional risk is eliminated if a progestogen is given continuously
* increased risk of venous thromboembolism
	+ increased by the addition of a progestogen
	+ transdermal HRT does not appear to increase the risk of VTE
	+ NICE state women requesting HRT who are at high risk for VTE should be referred to haematology before starting any treatment (even transdermal)
* increased risk of stroke
* increased risk of ischaemic heart disease if taken more than 10 years after menopause
