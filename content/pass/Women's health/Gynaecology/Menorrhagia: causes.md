Menorrhagia was previously defined as total blood loss \> 80 ml per menses, but it is obviously difficult to quantify. The assessment and management of heavy periods has therefore shifted towards what the woman considers to be excessive and aims to improve quality of life measures.   
  
Causes  
* dysfunctional uterine bleeding: this describes menorrhagia in the absence of underlying pathology. This accounts for approximately half of patients
* anovulatory cycles: these are more common at the extremes of a women's reproductive life
* uterine fibroids
* hypothyroidism
* intrauterine devices\*
* pelvic inflammatory disease
* bleeding disorders, e.g. von Willebrand disease
