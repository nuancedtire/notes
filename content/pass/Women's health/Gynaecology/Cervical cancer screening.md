The UK has a well\-established cervical cancer screening program which is estimated to prevent 1,000\-4,000 deaths per year. The main aim of cervical screening is to detect pre\-malignant changes rather than to detect cancer. It should be noted that cervical adenocarcinomas, which account for around 15% of cases, are frequently undetected by screening  
  
The programme has undergone a significant evolution in recent years. For many years the smears were examined for signs of dyskaryosis which may indicate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia \- management was based solely on the degree of dyskaryosis. The introduction of HPV testing allowed patients with mild dyskaryosis to be further risk\-stratified, i.e. as HPV is such a strong risk factor patients who were HPV negative could be treated as having normal results.  
  
The NHS has now moved to an **HPV first system**, i.e. a sample is tested for high\-risk strains of human papillomavirus (hrHPV) first and cytological examination is only performed if this is positive.  
  
Who is screened and how often?
------------------------------

  
A smear test is offered to all women between the ages of 25\-64 years  
* 25\-49 years: 3\-yearly screening
* 50\-64 years: 5\-yearly screening
* cervical screening cannot be offered to women over 64 (unlike breast screening, where patients can self\-refer once past screening age)
* in Scotland, it is offered from 25\-64 every 5 years

  
Special situations  
* cervical screening in pregnancy is usually delayed until 3 months post\-partum unless missed screening or previous abnormal smears.
* women who have never been sexually active have a very low risk of developing cervical cancer therefore they may wish to opt out of screening

  
It is said that the best time to take a cervical smear is around mid\-cycle. Whilst there is limited evidence to support this it is still the current advice given out by the NHS.
