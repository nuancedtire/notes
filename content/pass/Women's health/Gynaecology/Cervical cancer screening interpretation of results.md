The cervical cancer screening programme has undergone a significant evolution in recent years. For many years the smears were examined for signs of dyskaryosis which may indicate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia \- management was based solely on the degree of dyskaryosis. The introduction of HPV testing allowed patients with mild dyskaryosis to be further risk\-stratified, i.e. as HPV is such a strong risk factor patients who were HPV negative could be treated as having normal results.  
  
The NHS has now moved to an **HPV first system**, i.e. a sample is tested for high\-risk strains of human papillomavirus (hrHPV) first and cytological examination is only performed if this is positive.  
  
Management of results
---------------------

  
Negative hrHPV  
* return to normal recall, unless
	+ the test of cure (TOC) pathway: individuals who have been treated for CIN1, CIN2, or CIN3 should be invited 6 months after treatment for a test of cure repeat cervical sample in the community
	+ the untreated CIN1 pathway
	+ follow\-up for incompletely excised cervical glandular intraepithelial neoplasia (CGIN) / stratified mucin producing intraepithelial lesion (SMILE) or cervical cancer
	+ follow\-up for borderline changes in endocervical cells

  
Positive hrHPV  
* samples are examined cytologically
* if the cytology is abnormal → colposcopy
	+ this includes the following results:
	+ borderline changes in squamous or endocervical cells.
	+ low\-grade dyskaryosis.
	+ high\-grade dyskaryosis (moderate).
	+ high\-grade dyskaryosis (severe).
	+ invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
	+ glandular neoplasia
* if the cytology is normal (i.e. hrHPV \+ve but cytologically normal) the test is repeated at 12 months
	+ if the repeat test is now hrHPV \-ve → return to normal recall
	+ if the repeat test is still hrHPV \+ve and cytology still normal → further repeat test 12 months later:
	+ If hrHPV \-ve at 24 months → return to normal recall
	+ if hrHPV \+ve at 24 months → colposcopy

  
If the sample is 'inadequate'  
* repeat the sample in 3 months
* if two consecutive inadequate samples then → colposcopy

  
The follow\-up of patients who've previously had CIN is complicated but as a first step, individuals who've been treated for CIN1, CIN2, or CIN3 should be invited 6 months after treatment for a test of cure repeat cervical sample in the community.  
  
Treatment of CIN
----------------

  
Large loop excision of transformation zone (LLETZ) is the most common treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. LLETZ may sometimes be done during the initial colposcopy visit or at a later date depending on the individual clinic. Alternative techniques include cryotherapy.
