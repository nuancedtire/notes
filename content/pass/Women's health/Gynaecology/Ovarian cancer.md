Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common malignancy in females. The peak age of incidence is 60 years and it generally carries a poor prognosis due to late diagnosis.  
  
Pathophysiology  
* around 90% of ovarian cancers are epithelial in origin, with 70\-80% of cases being due to serous carcinomas
* interestingly, it is now increasingly recognised that the distal end of the fallopian tube is often the site of origin of many 'ovarian' cancers

  
Risk factors  
* family history: mutations of the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene
* many ovulations\*: early menarche, late menopause, nulliparity

  
Clinical features are notoriously vague  
* abdominal distension and bloating
* abdominal and pelvic pain
* urinary symptoms e.g. Urgency
* early satiety
* diarrhoea

  
Investigations  
* CA125
	+ NICE recommends a CA125 test is done initially. Endometriosis, menstruation, benign ovarian cysts and other conditions may also raise the CA125 level
	+ if the CA125 is raised (35 IU/mL or greater) then an urgent ultrasound scan of the abdomen and pelvis should be ordered
	+ a CA125 should not be used for screening for ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women
* ultrasound

  
Diagnosis is difficult and usually involves diagnostic laparotomy  
  
Management  
* usually a combination of surgery and platinum\-based chemotherapy

   
Prognosis  
* 80% of women have advanced disease at presentation
* the all stage 5\-year survival is 46%

  
\*It is traditionally taught that infertility treatment increases the risk of ovarian cancer, as it increases the number of ovulations. Recent evidence however suggests that there is not a significant link. The combined oral contraceptive pill reduces the risk (fewer ovulations) as does having many pregnancies.
