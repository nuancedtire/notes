The initial imaging modality for suspected ovarian cysts/tumours is ultrasound. The report will usually report that the cyst is either:  
* simple: unilocular, more likely to be physiological or benign
* complex: multilocular, more likely to be malignant

  
Management depends on the age of the patient and whether the patient is symptomatic. It should be remembered that the diagnosis of ovarian cancer is often delayed due to a vague presentation.  
  
Premenopausal women  
* a conservative approach may be taken for younger women (especially if \< 35 years) as malignancy is less common. If the cyst is small (e.g. \< 5 cm) and reported as 'simple' then it is highly likely to be benign. A repeat ultrasound should be arranged for 8\-12 weeks and referral considered if it persists.

  
Postmenopausal women  
* by definition physiological cysts are unlikely
* any postmenopausal woman with an ovarian cyst regardless of nature or size should be referred to gynaecology for assessment
