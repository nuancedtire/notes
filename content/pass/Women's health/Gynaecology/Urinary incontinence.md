Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common problem, affecting around 4\-5% of the population. It is more common in elderly females.   
  
Risk factors  
* advancing age
* previous pregnancy and childbirth
* high body mass index
* hysterectomy
* family history

  
Classification  
* overactive bladder (OAB)/urge incontinence
	+ due to detrusor overactivity
	+ the urge to urinate is quickly followed by uncontrollable leakage ranging from a few drops to complete bladder emptying
* stress incontinence: leaking small amounts when coughing or laughing
* mixed incontinence: both urge and stress
* overflow incontinence: due to bladder outlet obstruction, e.g. due to prostate enlargement
* functional incontinence
	+ comorbid physical conditions impair the patient's ability to get to a bathroom in time
	+ causes include dementia, sedating medication and injury/illness resulting in decreased ambulation

  
Initial investigation  
* bladder diaries should be completed for a minimum of 3 days
* vaginal examination to exclude pelvic organ prolapse and ability to initiate voluntary contraction of pelvic floor muscles ('Kegel' exercises)
* urine dipstick and culture
* urodynamic studies

  
Management depends on whether urge or stress UI is the predominant picture. If urge incontinence is predominant:  
* bladder retraining (lasts for a minimum of 6 weeks, the idea is to gradually increase the intervals between voiding)
* bladder stabilising drugs: antimuscarinics are first\-line
	+ NICE recommend oxybutynin (immediate release), tolterodine (immediate release) or darifenacin (once daily preparation)
	+ Immediate release oxybutynin should, however, be avoided in 'frail older women'
* mirabegron (a beta\-3 agonist) may be useful if there is concern about anticholinergic side\-effects in frail elderly patients

  
If stress incontinence is predominant:  
* pelvic floor muscle training
	+ NICE recommend at least 8 contractions performed 3 times per day for a minimum of 3 months
* surgical procedures: e.g. retropubic mid\-urethral tape procedures
* duloxetine may be offered to women if they decline surgical procedures
	+ a combined noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake inhibitor
	+ mechanism of action: increased synaptic concentration of noradrenaline and serotonin within the pudendal nerve → increased stimulation of urethral striated muscles within the sphincter → enhanced
