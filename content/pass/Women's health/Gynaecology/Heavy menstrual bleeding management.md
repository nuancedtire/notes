Heavy menstrual bleeding (also known as menorrhagia) was previously defined as total blood loss \> 80 ml per menses, but it is obviously difficult to quantify. The management has therefore shifted towards what the woman considers to be excessive. Prior to the 1990's many women underwent a hysterectomy to treat heavy periods but since that time the approach has altered radically. The management of menorrhagia now depends on whether a woman needs contraception.   
  
Investigations  
* a full blood count should be performed in all women
* NICE recommend arranging a routine transvaginal ultrasound scan if symptoms (for example, intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding, pelvic pain and/or pressure symptoms) suggest a structural or histological abnormality. Other indications include abnormal pelvic exam findings.

  
Does not require contraception  
* either mefenamic acid 500 mg tds (particularly if there is dysmenorrhoea as well) or tranexamic acid 1 g tds. Both are started on the first day of the period
* if no improvement then try other drug whilst awaiting referral

  
Requires contraception, options include  
* intrauterine system (Mirena) should be considered first\-line
* combined oral contraceptive pill
* long\-acting progestogens

  
Norethisterone 5 mg tds can be used as a short\-term option to rapidly stop heavy menstrual bleeding.
