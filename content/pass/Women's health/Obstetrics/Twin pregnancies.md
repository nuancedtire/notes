The incidence of multiple pregnancies is as follows  
* twins: 1/105
* triplets: 1/10,000

  
Twins may be dizygotic (non\-identical, develop from two separate ova that were fertilized at the same time) or monozygotic (identical, develop from a single ovum which has divided to form two embryos). Around 80% of twins are dizygotic  
  
Monoamniotic monozygotic twins are associated with:  
* increased spontaneous miscarriage, perinatal mortality rate
* increased malformations, IUGR, prematurity
* twin\-to\-twin transfusions: recipient is larger with polyhydramnios (do laser ablation of interconnecting vessels)

  
The rate of monozygotic twins is fairly constant. The incidence of dizygotic twins is increasing mainly due to infertility treatment. Predisposing factors for dizygotic twins include:  
* previous twins
* family history
* increasing maternal age
* multigravida
* induced ovulation and in\-vitro fertilisation
* race e.g. Afro\-Caribbean

  
Antenatal complications  
* polyhydramnios
* pregnancy induced hypertension
* anaemia
* antepartum haemorrhage

  
Fetal complications \- perinatal mortality (twins \* 5, triplets \* 10\)  
* prematurity (mean twins \= 37 weeks, triplets \= 33\)
* light\-for date babies
* malformation (\*3, especially monozygotic)

  
Labour complications  
* PPH increased (\*2\)
* malpresentation
* cord prolapse, entanglement

  
Management  
* rest
* ultrasound for diagnosis \+ monthly checks
* additional iron \+ folate
* more antenatal care (e.g. weekly \> 30 weeks)
* precautions at labour (e.g. 2 obstetricians present)
* 75% of twins deliver by 38 weeks, if longer most twins are induced at 38\-40 wks
