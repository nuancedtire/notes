Abdominal pain in pregnancy may be divided into causes which occur early, late or at any point.  
  
Early pregnancy
---------------

  


| Cause | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Ectopic pregnancy | This is the single most important cause of abdominal pain to exclude in early pregnancy0\.5% of all pregnancies are ectopicRisk factors (anything slowing the ovum's passage to the uterus)* damage to tubes (salpingitis, surgery) * previous ectopic * IVF (3% of pregnancies are ectopic)  A typical history is a female with a history of 6\-8 weeks amenorrhoea who presents with lower abdominal pain and later develops vaginal bleeding* lower abdominal pain: typically the first symptom. Pain is usually constant and may be unilateral. Due to tubal spasm * vaginal bleeding: usually less than a normal period, may be dark brown in colour * history of recent amenorrhoea: typically 6\-8 weeks from start of last period; if longer (e.g. 10 wks) this suggest another causes e.g. inevitable abortion * peritoneal bleeding can cause shoulder tip pain and pain on defecation / urination |
| Miscarriage | Threatened miscarriage* painless vaginal bleeding occurring before 24 weeks, but typically occurs at 6 \- 9 weeks * cervical os is closed * complicates up to 25% of all pregnancies  Missed (delayed) miscarriage* a gestational sac which contains a dead fetus before 20 weeks without the symptoms of expulsion * mother may have light vaginal bleeding / discharge and the symptoms of pregnancy which disappear * when the gestational sac is \> 25 mm and no embryonic/fetal part can be seen it is sometimes described as a 'blighted ovum' or 'anembryonic pregnancy'  Inevitable miscarriage* cervical os is open * heavy bleeding with clots and pain  Incomplete miscarriage* not all products of conception have been expelled |

  
Late pregnancy
--------------

  


| Cause | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Labour | Regular tightening of the abdomen which may be painful in the later stages |
| Placental abruption | Placental abruption describes separation of a normally sited placenta from the uterine wall, resulting in maternal haemorrhage into the intervening spaceOccurs in approximately 1/200 pregnanciesClinical features* shock out of keeping with visible loss * pain constant * tender, tense uterus * normal lie and presentation * fetal heart: absent/distressed * coagulation problems * beware pre\-eclampsia, DIC, anuria |
| Symphysis pubis dysfunction | Ligament laxity increases in response to hormonal changes of pregnancyPain over the pubic symphysis with radiation to the groins and the medial aspects of the thighs. A waddling gait may be seen |
| Pre\-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome | Associated with hypertension, proteinuria. Patients with HELLP also have haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and a low platelet count.The pain is typically epigastric or in the RUQ |
| Uterine rupture | Ruptures usually occur during labour but occur in third trimesterRisk factors: previous caesarean sectionPresents with maternal shock, abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding to varying degree |

  
Any point in pregnancy
----------------------

  


| Cause | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Appendicitis | Occurs in 1:1,000\-2:1,000 pregnancies, making it the most common non\-obstetric surgical emergencyHigher morbidity and mortality in pregnancyLocation of pain changes depending on gestation, moving up from the RLQ in the first trimester to the umbilicus in the second and the RUQ in the third |
| Urinary tract infection (UTI) | 1 in 25 women develop in UTI in pregnancyAssociated with an increased risk of pre\-term delivery and IUGR |
