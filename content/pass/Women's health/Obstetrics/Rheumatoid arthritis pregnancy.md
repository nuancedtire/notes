Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) typically develops in women of a reproductive age. Issues surrounding conception are therefore commonly encountered. There are no current published guidelines regarding how patients considering conception should be managed although expert reviews are largely in agreement.  
  
Key points  
* patients with early or poorly controlled RA should be advised to defer conception until their disease is more stable
* RA symptoms tend to improve in pregnancy but only resolve in a small minority. Patients tend to have a flare following delivery
* methotrexate is not safe in pregnancy and needs to be stopped at least 6 months before conception
* leflunomide is not safe in pregnancy
* sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine are considered safe in pregnancy
* interestingly studies looking at pregnancy outcomes in patients treated with TNF\-α blockers do not show any significant increase in adverse outcomes. It should be noted however that many of the patients included in the study stopped taking TNF\-α blockers when they found out they were pregnant
* low\-dose corticosteroids may be used in pregnancy to control symptoms
* NSAIDs may be used until 32 weeks but after this time should be withdrawn due to the risk of early close of the ductus arteriosus
* patients should be referred to an obstetric anaesthetist due to the risk of atlanto\-axial subluxation
