The RCOG has produced guidelines suggesting the following classification of perineal tears:  
* first degree
	+ superficial damage with no muscle involvement
	+ do not require any repair
* second degree
	+ injury to the perineal muscle, but not involving the anal sphincter
	+ require suturing on the ward by a suitably experienced midwife or clinician
* third degree
	+ injury to perineum involving the anal sphincter complex (external anal sphincter, EAS and internal anal sphincter, IAS)
	+ 3a: less than 50% of EAS thickness torn
	+ 3b: more than 50% of EAS thickness torn
	+ 3c: IAS torn
	+ require repair in theatre by a suitably trained clinician
* fourth degree
	+ injury to perineum involving the anal sphincter complex (EAS and IAS) and rectal mucosa
	+ require repair in theatre by a suitably trained clinician

  
Risk factors for perineal tears  
* primigravida
* large babies
* precipitant labour
* shoulder dystocia
* forceps delivery
