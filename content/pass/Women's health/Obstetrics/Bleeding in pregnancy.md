The table below outlines the major causes of bleeding during pregnancy. Antepartum haemorrhage is defined as bleeding after 24 weeks  
  


| **1st trimester** | **2nd trimester** | **3rd trimester** |

Alongside the pregnancy related causes, conditions such as sexually transmitted infections and cervical polyps should be excluded.   
  
The table below outlines the key features of each condition:  
  


| **Spontaneous abortion** | **Threatened miscarriage** \- painless vaginal bleeding typically around 6\-9 weeks**Missed (delayed) miscarriage** \- light vaginal bleeding and symptoms of pregnancy disappear**Inevitable miscarriage** \- complete or incomplete depending or whether all fetal and placental tissue has been expelled. **Incomplete miscarriage** \- heavy bleeding and crampy, lower abdo pain. **Complete miscarriage** \- little bleeding |
| --- | --- |
| **Ectopic pregnancy** | Typically history of 6\-8 weeks amenorrhoea with lower abdominal pain (usually unilateral) initially and vaginal bleeding later. Shoulder tip pain and cervical excitation may be present |
| **Hydatidiform mole** | Typically bleeding in first or early second trimester associated with exaggerated symptoms of pregnancy e.g. hyperemesis. The uterus may be large for dates and serum hCG is very high |
| **Placental abruption** | Constant lower abdominal pain and, woman may be more shocked than is expected by visible blood loss. Tender, tense uterus\* with normal lie and presentation. Fetal heart may be distressed |
| **Placental praevia** | Vaginal bleeding, no pain. Non\-tender uterus\* but lie and presentation may be abnormal |
| **Vasa praevia** | Rupture of membranes followed immediately by vaginal bleeding. Fetal bradycardia is classically seen |

  
\*vaginal examination should not be performed in primary care for suspected antepartum haemorrhage \- women with placenta praevia may haemorrhage
