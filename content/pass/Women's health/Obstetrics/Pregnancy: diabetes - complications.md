Maternal complications  
* polyhydramnios \- 25%, possibly due to fetal polyuria
* preterm labour \- 15%, associated with polyhydramnios

  
Neonatal complications  
* macrosomia (although diabetes may also cause small for gestational age babies)
* hypoglycaemia (secondary to beta cell hyperplasia)
* respiratory distress syndrome: surfactant production is delayed
* polycythaemia: therefore more neonatal jaundice
* malformation rates increase 3\-4 fold e.g. sacral agenesis, CNS and CVS malformations (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
* stillbirth
* hypomagnesaemia
* hypocalcaemia
* shoulder dystocia (may cause Erb's palsy)
