The rate of caesarean section has increased significantly in recent years, largely secondary to an increased fear of litigation  
  
There are two main types of caesarean section:  
* lower segment caesarean section: now comprises 99% of cases
* classic caesarean section: longitudinal incision in the upper segment of the uterus

  
Indications (apart from cephalopelvic disproportion/praevia, most are relative)  
* absolute cephalopelvic disproportion
* placenta praevia grades 3/4
* pre\-eclampsia
* post\-maturity
* IUGR
* fetal distress in labour/prolapsed cord
* failure of labour to progress
* malpresentations: brow
* placental abruption: only if fetal distress; if dead deliver vaginally
* vaginal infection e.g. active herpes
* cervical cancer (disseminates cancer cells)

  
Caesarean sections may be categorised by the urgency  
* Category 1
	+ an immediate threat to the life of the mother or baby
	+ examples indications include: suspected uterine rupture, major placental abruption, cord prolapse, fetal hypoxia or persistent fetal bradycardia
	+ delivery of the baby should occur within 30 minutes of making the decision
* Category 2
	+ maternal or fetal compromise which is not immediately life\-threatening
	+ delivery of the baby should occur within 75 minutes of making the decision
* Category 3
	+ delivery is required, but mother and baby are stable
* Category 4
	+ elective caesarean

  
The RCOG advise clinicians to make women aware of serious and frequent risks:  
  


| 'Serious' | 'Frequent' |
| --- | --- |
| Maternal:* emergency hysterectomy * need for further surgery at a later date, including curettage (retained placental tissue) * admission to intensive care unit * thromboembolic disease * bladder injury * ureteric injury * death (1 in 12,000\)  Future pregnancies:* increased risk of uterine rupture during subsequent pregnancies/deliveries * increased risk of antepartum stillbirth * increased risk in subsequent pregnancies of placenta praevia and placenta accreta) | Maternal:* persistent wound and abdominal discomfort in the first few months after surgery * increased risk of repeat caesarean section when vaginal delivery attempted in subsequent pregnancies * readmission to hospital * haemorrhage * infection (wound, endometritis, UTI)  Fetal:* lacerations, one to two babies in every 100 |

  
Other complications which are recognised but not specificially mentioned in the RCOG document include;  
* prolonged ileus
* subfertility: due to postoperative adhesions

  
Vaginal birth after Caesarean (VBAC)  
* planned VBAC is an appropriate method of delivery for pregnant women at \>\= 37 weeks gestation with a single previous Caesarean delivery
* around 70\-75% of women in this situation have a successful vaginal delivery
* contraindications include previous uterine rupture or classical caesarean scar
