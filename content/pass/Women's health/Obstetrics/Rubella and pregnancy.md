Rubella, also known as German measles, is a viral infection caused by the togavirus. Following the introduction of the MMR vaccine it is now rare. If contracted during pregnancy there is a risk of congenital rubella syndrome. Remember that the incubation period is 14\-21 days and individuals are infectious from 7 days before symptoms appear to 4 days after the onset of the rash.   
  
Risk  
* in first 8\-10 weeks risk of damage to fetus is as high as 90%
* damage is rare after 16 weeks

  
Features of congenital rubella syndrome  
* sensorineural deafness
* congenital cataracts
* congenital heart disease (e.g. patent ductus arteriosus)
* growth retardation
* hepatosplenomegaly
* purpuric skin lesions
* 'salt and pepper' chorioretinitis
* microphthalmia
* cerebral palsy

  
Diagnosis  
* suspected cases should be discussed immediately with the local Health Protection Unit (HPU) as type/timing of investigations may vary
* IgM antibodies are raised in women recently exposed to the virus
* it should be noted that it is very difficult to distinguish rubella from parvovirus B19 clinically. It is therefore important to also check parvovirus B19 serology as there is a 30% risk of transplacental infection, with a 5\-10% risk of fetal loss

  
Management  
* suspected cases of rubella in pregnancy should be discussed with the local Health Protection Unit
* since 2016, rubella immunity is no longer routinely checked at the booking visit
* if a woman is however tested at any point and no immunity is demonstrated they should be advised to keep away from people who might have rubella
* non\-immune mothers should be offered the MMR vaccination in the post\-natal period
	+ MMR vaccines should not be administered to women known to be pregnant or attempting to become pregnant
