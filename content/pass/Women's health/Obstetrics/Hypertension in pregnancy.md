It's useful to remember that in normal pregnancy:  
* blood pressure usually falls in the first trimester (particularly the diastolic), and continues to fall until 20\-24 weeks
* after this time the blood pressure usually increases to pre\-pregnancy levels by term

  
NICE published guidance in 2010 on the management of hypertension in pregnancy. They also made recommendations on reducing the risk of hypertensive disorders developing in the first place. Women who are at high risk of developing pre\-eclampsia should take aspirin 75mg od from 12 weeks until the birth of the baby.   
  
Hypertension in pregnancy in usually defined as:  
* systolic \> 140 mmHg or diastolic \> 90 mmHg
* or an increase above booking readings of \> 30 mmHg systolic or \> 15 mmHg diastolic

  
After establishing that the patient is hypertensive they should be categorised into one of the following groups  
  


| **Pre\-existing hypertension** | **Pregnancy\-induced hypertension (PIH, also known as gestational hypertension)** | **Pre\-eclampsia** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A history of hypertension before pregnancy or an elevated blood pressure \> 140/90 mmHg before 20 weeks gestationNo proteinuria, no oedema Occurs in 3\-5% of pregnancies and is more common in older womenIf a pregnant woman takes an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) for pre\-existing hypertension this should be stopped immediately and alternative antihypertensives started (e.g. labetalol) whilst awaiting specialist review | Hypertension (as defined above) occurring in the second half of pregnancy (i.e. after 20 weeks)No proteinuria, no oedema Occurs in around 5\-7% of pregnanciesResolves following birth (typically after one month). Women with PIH are at increased risk of future pre\-eclampsia or hypertension later in life | Pregnancy\-induced hypertension in association with proteinuria (\> 0\.3g / 24 hours)Oedema may occur but is now less commonly used as a criteriaOccurs in around 5% of pregnancies |

  
Management  
* oral labetalol is now first\-line following the 2010 NICE guidelines
* oral nifedipine (e.g. if asthmatic) and hydralazine
