Folic acid is converted to tetrahydrofolate (THF). Green, leafy vegetables are a good source of folic acid.  
  
Functions  
* THF plays a key role in the transfer of 1\-carbon units (e.g. methyl, methylene, and formyl groups) to the essential substrates involved in the synthesis of DNA \& RNA

  
Causes of folic acid deficiency:  
* phenytoin
* methotrexate
* pregnancy
* alcohol excess

  
Consequences of folic acid deficiency:  
* macrocytic, megaloblastic anaemia
* neural tube defects

  
Prevention of neural tube defects (NTD) during pregnancy:  
* all women should take 400mcg of folic acid until the 12th week of pregnancy
* women at higher risk of conceiving a child with a NTD should take 5mg of folic acid from before conception until the 12th week of pregnancy
* women are considered higher risk if any of the following apply:
	+ either partner has a NTD, they have had a previous pregnancy affected by a NTD, or they have a family history of a NTD
	+ the woman is taking antiepileptic drugs or has coeliac disease, diabetes, or thalassaemia trait.
	+ the woman is obese (defined as a body mass index \[BMI] of 30 kg/m2 or more).
