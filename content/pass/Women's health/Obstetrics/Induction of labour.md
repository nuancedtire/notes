Induction of labour describes a process where labour is started artificially. It happens in around 20% of pregnancies.  
  
Indications  
* prolonged pregnancy, e.g. 1\-2 weeks after the estimated date of delivery
* prelabour premature rupture of the membranes, where labour does not start
* maternal medical problems
	+ diabetic mother \> 38 weeks
	+ pre\-eclampsia
	+ obstetric cholestasis
* intrauterine fetal death

  
Bishop score
------------

  
The Bishop score is used to help assess whether induction of labour will be required. It has the following components:  
  


|  | **0** | **1** | **2** | **3** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cervical position** | Posterior | Intermediate | Anterior | \- |
| **Cervical consistency** | Firm | Intermediate | Soft | \- |
| **Cervical effacement** | 0\-30% | 40\-50% | 60\-70% | 80% |
| **Cervical dilation** | \<1 cm | 1\-2 cm | 3\-4 cm | \>5 cm |
| **Fetal station** | \-3 | \-2 | \-1, 0 | \+1,\+2 |

  
Interpretation  
* a score of \< 5 indicates that labour is unlikely to start without induction
* a score of ≥ 8 indicates that the cervix is ripe, or 'favourable' \- there is a high chance of spontaneous labour, or response to interventions made to induce labour

  
Management
----------

  
Possible methods  
* membrane sweep
	+ involves the examining finger passing through the cervix to rotate against the wall of the uterus, to separate the chorionic membrane from the decidua
	+ can be done by a midwife at the antenatal clinic. Nulliparous women are typically offered this at the 40\- and 41\-week antenatal visit, whereas parous women are offered it at the 41\-week visit
	+ membrane sweeping is regarded as an adjunct to induction of labour rather than an actual method of induction
	+ prior to formal induction of labour, women should be offered a vaginal examination for membrane sweeping
* vaginal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)
	+ also known as dinoprostone
* oral prostaglandin E1
	+ also known as misoprostol
* maternal oxytocin infusion
* amniotomy ('breaking of waters')
* cervical ripening balloon
	+ passed through the endocervical canal and gently inflated to dilate the cervix

  
NICE guidelines  
* if the Bishop score is ≤ 6
	+ vaginal prostaglandins or oral misoprostol
	+ mechanical methods such as a balloon catheter can be considered if the woman is at higher risk of hyperstimulation or has had a previous caesarean
* if the Bishop score is \> 6 
	+ amniotomy and an intravenous oxytocin infusion

  
Complications
-------------

  
Uterine hyperstimulation  
* the main complication of induction of labour
* refers to prolonged and frequent uterine contractions \- sometimes called tachysystole
* potential consequences
	+ intermittent interruption of blood flow to the intervillous space over time may result in fetal hypoxemia and acidemia
	+ uterine rupture (rare)
* management
	+ removing the vaginal prostaglandins if possible and stopping the oxytocin infusion if one has been started
	+ consider tocolysis
