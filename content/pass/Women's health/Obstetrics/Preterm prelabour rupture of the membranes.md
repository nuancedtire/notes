Preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROM) occurs in around 2% of pregnancies but is associated with around 40% of preterm deliveries  
  
Complications of PPROM  
* fetal: prematurity, infection, pulmonary hypoplasia
* maternal: chorioamnionitis

  
Confirming PPROM  
* a sterile speculum examination should be performed (to look for pooling of amniotic fluid in the posterior vaginal vault) but digital examination should be avoided due to the risk of infection
* if pooling of fluid is not observed NICE recommend testing the fluid for placental alpha microglobulin\-1 protein (PAMG\-1\) (e.g. AmniSureÂµ) or insulin\-like growth factor binding protein\-1
* ultrasound may also be useful to show oligohydramnios

  
Management   
* admission
* regular observations to ensure chorioamnionitis is not developing
* oral erythromycin should be given for 10 days
* antenatal corticosteroids should be administered to reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome
* delivery should be considered at 34 weeks of gestation \- there is a trade\-off between an increased risk of maternal chorioamnionitis with a decreased risk of respiratory distress syndrome as the pregnancy progresses
