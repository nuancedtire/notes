Pre\-eclampsia describes the emergence of high blood pressure during pregnancy that may be a precursor to a woman developing eclampsia and other complications. It is classically a triad of 3 things:  
* new\-onset hypertension
* proteinuria
* oedema

  
Definition
----------

  
The current formal definition is as follows  
* new\-onset blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg after 20 weeks of pregnancy, AND 1 or more of the following:
	+ proteinuria
	+ other organ involvement (see list below for examples): e.g. renal insufficiency (creatinine ≥ 90 umol/L), liver, neurological, haematological, uteroplacental dysfunction

  
Features
--------

  
Potential consequences of pre\-eclampsia  
* eclampsia
	+ other neurological complications include altered mental status, blindness, stroke, clonus, severe headaches or persistent visual scotomata
* fetal complications
	+ intrauterine growth retardation
	+ prematurity
* liver involvement (elevated transaminases)
* haemorrhage: placental abruption, intra\-abdominal, intra\-cerebral
* cardiac failure

  
Features of severe pre\-eclampsia  
* hypertension: typically \> 160/110 mmHg and proteinuria as above
* proteinuria: dipstick \+\+/\+\+\+
* headache
* visual disturbance
* papilloedema
* RUQ/epigastric pain
* hyperreflexia
* platelet count \< 100 \* 106/l, abnormal liver enzymes or HELLP syndrome

  
Prevention
----------

  
NICE divide risk factors into high and moderate risk:  
  


| High risk factors | Moderate risk factors |
| --- | --- |
| * hypertensive disease in a previous pregnancy * chronic kidney disease * autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome * type 1 or type 2 diabetes * chronic hypertension | * first pregnancy * age 40 years or older * pregnancy interval of more than 10 years * body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m² or more at first visit * family history of pre\-eclampsia * multiple pregnancy |

  
Reducing the risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy  
* women with the following should take aspirin 75\-150mg daily from 12 weeks gestation until the birth
	+ ≥ 1 high risk factors
	+ ≥ 2 moderate factors

  
Management
----------

  
Initial assessment  
* NICE recommend arranging emergency secondary care assessment for any woman in whom pre\-eclampsia is suspected
* women with blood pressure ≥ 160/110 mmHg are likely to be admitted and observed

  
Further management  
* oral labetalol is now first\-line following the 2010 NICE guidelines. Nifedipine (e.g. if asthmatic) and hydralazine may also be used
* delivery of the baby is the most important and definitive management step. The timing depends on the individual clinical scenario
