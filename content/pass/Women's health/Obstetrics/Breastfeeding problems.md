'Minor' breastfeeding problems  
* frequent feeding in a breastfed infant is not alone a sign of low milk supply
* nipple pain: may be caused by a poor latch
* blocked duct ('milk bleb'): causes nipple pain when breastfeeding. Breastfeeding should continue. Advice should be sought regarding the positioning of the baby. Breast massage may also be tried
* nipple candidiasis: treatment for nipple candidiasis whilst breastfeeding should involve miconazole cream for the mother and nystatin suspension for the baby

  
  
Mastitis
--------

  
Mastitis affects around 1 in 10 breastfeeding women. The BNF advises to treat 'if systemically unwell, if nipple fissure present, if symptoms do not improve after 12\-24 hours of effective milk removal of if culture indicates infection'. The first\-line antibiotic is flucloxacillin for 10\-14 days. Breastfeeding or expressing should continue during treatment.  
  
If left untreated, mastitis may develop into a breast abscess. This generally requires incision and drainage.  
  
  
Engorgement
-----------

  
Breast engorgement is one of the causes of breast pain in breastfeeding women. It usually occurs in the first few days after the infant is born and almost always affects both breasts. The pain or discomfort is typically worse just before a feed. Milk tends to not flow well from an engorged breast and the infant may find it difficult to attach and suckle. Fever may be present but usually settles within 24 hours. The breasts may appear red. Complications include blocked milk ducts, mastitis and difficulties with breastfeeding and, subsequently, milk supply.   
  
Although it may initially be painful, hand expression of milk may help relieve the discomfort of engorgement.  
  
  
Raynaud's disease of the nipple
-------------------------------

  
In Raynaud's disease of the nipple, pain is often intermittent and present during and immediately after feeding. Blanching of the nipple may be followed by cyanosis and/or erythema. Nipple pain resolves when nipples return to normal colour.   
  
Options of treatment for Raynaud's disease of the nipple include advice on minimising exposure to cold, use of heat packs following a breastfeed, avoiding caffeine and stopping smoking. If symptoms persist consider specialist referral for a trial of oral nifedipine (off\-license).  
  
  
Concerns about poor infant weight gain
--------------------------------------

  
Around 1 in 10 breastfed babies lose more than the 'cut\-off' 10% threshold in the first week of life. This should prompt consideration of the above breastfeeding problems. The infant should also be examined to look for any underlying problems. NICE recommends an 'expert' review of feeding if this occurs (e.g. midwife\-led breastfeeding clinics) and monitoring of weight until weight gain is satisfactory
