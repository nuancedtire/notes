Cardiotocography (CTG) records pressure changes in the uterus using internal or external pressure transducers  
  
The normal fetal heart rate varies between 100\-160 / min  
  


| **Feature** | **Description** | **Causes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline bradycardia | Heart rate \< 100 /min | Increased fetal vagal tone, maternal beta\-blocker use |
| Baseline tachycardia | Heart rate \> 160 /min | Maternal pyrexia, chorioamnionitis, hypoxia, prematurity |
| Loss of baseline variability | \< 5 beats / min | Prematurity, hypoxia |
| Early deceleration | Deceleration of the heart rate which commences with the onset of a contraction and returns to normal on completion of the contraction | Usually an innocuous feature and indicates head compression |
| Late deceleration | Deceleration of the heart rate which lags the onset of a contraction and does not returns to normal until after 30 seconds following the end of the contraction | Indicates fetal distress e.g. asphyxia or placental insufficiency |
| Variable decelerations | Independent of contractions | May indicate cord compression |
