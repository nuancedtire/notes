The risks of uncontrolled epilepsy during pregnancy generally outweigh the risks of medication to the fetus. All women thinking about becoming pregnant should be advised to take folic acid 5mg per day well before pregnancy to minimise the risk of neural tube defects. Around 1\-2% of newborns born to non\-epileptic mothers have congenital defects. This rises to 3\-4% if the mother takes antiepileptic medication.  
  
Other points  
* aim for monotherapy
* there is no indication to monitor antiepileptic drug levels
* sodium valproate: associated with neural tube defects
* carbamazepine: often considered the least teratogenic of the older antiepileptics
* phenytoin: associated with cleft palate
* lamotrigine: studies to date suggest the rate of congenital malformations may be low. The dose of lamotrigine may need to be increased in pregnancy

  
Breast feeding is generally considered safe for mothers taking antiepileptics with the possible exception of the barbiturates  
  
It is advised that pregnant women taking phenytoin are given vitamin K in the last month of pregnancy to prevent clotting disorders in the newborn  
  
Sodium valproate
----------------

  
The November 2013 issue of the Drug Safety Update also carried a warning about new evidence showing a significant risk of neurodevelopmental delay in children following maternal use of sodium valproate.  
  
The update concludes that sodium valproate should not be used during pregnancy and in women of childbearing age unless clearly necessary. Women of childbearing age should not start treatment without specialist neurological or psychiatric advice.
