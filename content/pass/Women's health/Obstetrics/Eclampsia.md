Eclampsia may be defined as the development of seizures in association pre\-eclampsia. To recap, pre\-eclampsia is defined as:  
* condition seen after 20 weeks gestation
* pregnancy\-induced hypertension
* proteinuria

  
Magnesium sulphate is used to both prevent seizures in patients with severe pre\-eclampsia and treat seizures once they develop. Guidelines on its use suggest the following:  
* should be given once a decision to deliver has been made
* in eclampsia an IV bolus of 4g over 5\-10 minutes should be given followed by an infusion of 1g / hour
* urine output, reflexes, respiratory rate and oxygen saturations should be monitored during treatment
	+ respiratory depression can occur: calcium gluconate is the first\-line treatment for magnesium sulphate induced respiratory depression
* treatment should continue for 24 hours after last seizure or delivery (around 40% of seizures occur post\-partum)

  
Other important aspects of treating severe pre\-eclampsia/eclampsia include fluid restriction to avoid the potentially serious consequences of fluid overload
