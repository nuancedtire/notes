NICE issued guidelines on routine care for the healthy pregnant woman in March 2008  
  
Nausea and vomiting  
* natural remedies \- ginger and acupuncture on the 'p6' point (by the wrist) are recommended by NICE
* antihistamines should be used first\-line (BNF suggests promethazine as first\-line)

  
Vitamin D  
* NICE recommend 'All women should be informed at the booking appointment about the importance for their own and their baby's health of maintaining adequate vitamin D stores during pregnancy and whilst breastfeeding'
* 'women may choose to take 10 micrograms of vitamin D per day, as found in the Healthy Start multivitamin supplement'. This was confirmed in 2012 when the Chief Medical Officer advised: 'All pregnant and breastfeeding women should take a daily supplement containing 10micrograms of vitamin D, to ensure the mothers requirements for vitamin D are met and to build adequate fetal stores for early infancy'
* particular care should be taken with women at risk (e.g. Asian, obese, poor diet)

  
Alcohol  
* in 2016 the Chief Medical Officer proposed new guidelines in relation to the safe consumption of alcohol following an expert group report.
* the government now recommend pregnant women should not drink. The wording of the official advice is 'If you are pregnant or planning a pregnancy, the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all, to keep risks to your baby to a minimum. Drinking in pregnancy can lead to long\-term harm to the baby, with the more you drink the greater the risk.'
