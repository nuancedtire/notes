Risk of prematurity  
* increased mortality depends on the gestation
* respiratory distress syndrome
* intraventricular haemorrhage
* necrotizing enterocolitis
* chronic lung disease, hypothermia, feeding problems, infection, jaundice
* retinopathy of prematurity
	+ important cause of visual impairment in babies born before 32 weeks gestation
	+ the cause is not fully understood and multivariate. One of the contributing factors is thought to be over oxygenation (e.g. during ventilation) resulting in a proliferation of retinal blood vessels (neovascularization)
	+ screening is done in at\-risk groups
* hearing problems
