* indicates how the mother has felt over the previous week
* score \> 13 indicates a 'depressive illness of varying severity'
* sensitivity and specificity \> 90%
* includes a question about self\-harm

| Reassurance and support, the health visitor has a key role | As with the baby blues reassurance and support are importantNICE CKS state *'Most women with the baby blues will not require specific treatment other than reassurance'*Cognitive behavioural therapy may be beneficial. Certain SSRIs such as sertraline and paroxetine\* may be used if symptoms are severe\*\* \- whilst they are secreted in breast milk it is not thought to be harmful to the infant | Admission to hospital is usually required, ideally in a Mother \& Baby UnitThere is around a 25\-50% risk of recurrence following future pregnancies |

  
\*paroxetine is recommended by SIGN because of the low milk/plasma ratio  
\*\*fluoxetine is best avoided due to a long half\-life
