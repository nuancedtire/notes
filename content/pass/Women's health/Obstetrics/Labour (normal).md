Labour may be defined as the onset of regular and painful contractions associated with cervical dilation and descent of the presenting part  
  
Signs of labour include  
* regular and painful uterine contractions
* a show (shedding of mucous plug)
* rupture of the membranes (not always)
* shortening and dilation of the cervix

  
Labour may be divided in to three stages  
* stage 1: from the onset of true labour to when the cervix is fully dilated
* stage 2: from full dilation to delivery of the fetus
* stage 3: from delivery of fetus to when the placenta and membranes have been completely delivered
