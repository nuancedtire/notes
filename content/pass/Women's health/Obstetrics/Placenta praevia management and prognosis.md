Placenta praevia describes a placenta lying wholly or partly in the lower uterine segment.  
  
If low\-lying placenta at the 20\-week scan:  
* rescan at 32 weeks
* no need to limit activity or intercourse unless they bleed
* if still present at 32 weeks and grade I/II then scan every 2 weeks
* final ultrasound at 36\-37 weeks to determine the method of delivery
	+ elective caesarean section for grades III/IV between 37\-38 weeks
	+ if grade I then a trial of vaginal delivery may be offered
* if a woman with known placenta praevia goes into labour prior to the elective caesarean section an emergency caesarean section should be performed due to the risk of post\-partum haemorrhage

  
Placenta praevia with bleeding  
* admit
* ABC approach to stabilise the woman
* if not able to stabilise → emergency caesarean section
* if in labour or term reached → emergency caesarean section

  
Prognosis  
* death is now extremely rare
* major cause of death in women with placenta praevia is now PPH
