Labour may be divided in to three stages  
* stage 1: from the onset of true labour to when the cervix is fully dilated
* stage 2: from full dilation to delivery of the fetus
* stage 3: from delivery of fetus to when the placenta and membranes have been completely delivered

  
Stage 2 \- from full dilation to delivery of the fetus  
* 'passive second stage' refers to the 2nd stage but in the absence of pushing (normal)
* active second stage' refers to the active process of maternal pushing
* less painful than 1st (pushing masks pain)
* lasts approximately 1 hours
* if longer than 1 hour (can be left longer if epidural) consider Ventouse extraction, forceps delivery or caesarean section
* episiotomy may be necessary following crowning
* associated with transient fetal bradycardia
