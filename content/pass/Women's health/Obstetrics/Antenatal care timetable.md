NICE issued guidelines on routine care for the healthy pregnant woman in March 2008\. They recommend:  
* 10 antenatal visits in the first pregnancy if uncomplicated
* 7 antenatal visits in subsequent pregnancies if uncomplicated
* women do not need to be seen by a consultant if the pregnancy is uncomplicated

\*the evidence base suggests that there is little difference in the efficacy of single\-dose (at 28 weeks) and double\-dose regimes (at 28 \& 34 weeks). For this reason the RCOG in 2011 advised that either regime could be used 'depending on local factors'
