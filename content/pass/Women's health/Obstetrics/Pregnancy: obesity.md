Obese women, and their unborn children, are at an increased risk of a number of complications during pregnancy and labour. Obesity is usually defined as a body mass index (BMI) \>\= 30 kg/m² at the first antenatal visit.  
  
Maternal risks  
* miscarriage
* venous thromboembolism
* gestational diabetes
* pre\-eclampsia
* dysfunctional labour, induced labour
* postpartum haemorrhage
* wound infections

  
There is also a higher caesarean section rate.  
  
Fetal risks  
* congenital anomaly
* prematurity
* macrosomia
* stillbirth
* increased risk of developing obesity and metabolic disorders in childhood
* neonatal death

  
With respect to weight loss, NICE state:  
  
 **Explain to women with a BMI of 30 or more at the booking appointment how this poses a risk, both to their health and the health of the unborn child. Explain that they should not try to reduce this risk by dieting while pregnant and that the risk will be managed by the health professionals caring for them during their pregnancy**  
Management  
* obese women should take 5mg of folic acid, rather than 400mcg
* all obese women should be screened for gestational diabetes with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24\-28 weeks
* if the BMI \>\= 35 kg/m² women should give birth in a consultant\-led obstetric unit
* if the BMI \>\= 40 kg/m² should have an antenatal consultation with an obstetric anaesthetist and a plan made
