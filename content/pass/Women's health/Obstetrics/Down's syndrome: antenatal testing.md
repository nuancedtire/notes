NICE issued updated guidelines on antenatal care in 2021 including advice on screening for Down's syndrome  
* the combined test is now standard
	+ these tests should be done between 11 \- 13\+6 weeks
	+ nuchal translucency measurement \+ serum B\-HCG \+ pregnancy\-associated plasma protein A (PAPP\-A)
	+ Down's syndrome is suggested by ↑ HCG, ↓ PAPP\-A, thickened nuchal translucency
	+ trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome) and 13 (Patau syndrome) give similar results but the hCG tends to lower
* quadruple test
* if women book later in pregnancy the quadruple test should be offered between 15 \- 20 weeks
	+ quadruple test: alpha\-fetoprotein, unconjugated oestriol, human chorionic gonadotrophin and inhibin A

  
### Interpreting the results of quadrapule tests

  


|  | Alpha\-fetoprotein | Unconjugated oestriol | Human chorionic gonadotrophin | Inhibin A |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Down's syndrome** | ↓ | ↓ | ↑ | ↑ |
| **Edward's syndrome** | ↓ | ↓ | ↓ | ↔ |
| **Neural tube defects** | ↑ | ↔ | ↔ | ↔ |

  
### Results of combined or quadruple tests

  
Both the combined and quadruple tests return either a 'lower chance' or 'higher chance' result  
* 'lower chance': 1 in 150 chance or more e.g. 1 in 300
* 'higher chance': 1 in 150 chance or less e.g. 1 in 100

  
### Non\-invasive prenatal screening test (NIPT)

  
If a woman has a 'higher chance' results she will be offered a second screening test (NIPT) or a diagnostic test (e.g. amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Given the non\-invasive nature of NIPT and extremely high sensitivity and specificity, it is likely this will be the preferred choice for the vast majority of women.  
  
NIPT  
* analyses small DNA fragments that circulate in the blood of a pregnant woman (cell free fetal DNA, cffDNA)
* cffDNA derives from placental cells and is usually identical to fetal DNA
* analysis of cffDNA allows for the early detection of certain chromosomal abnormalities
* sensitivity and specificity are very high for trisomy 21 (\>99%) and similarly high for other chromosomal abnormalities
* private companies (e.g. Harmony) offer NIPT screening from 10 weeks gestation
