A basic understanding of the pathophysiology is essential to understand the management of Rhesus negative pregnancies  
* along with the ABO system the Rhesus system is the most important antigen found on red blood cells. The D antigen is the most important antigen of the rhesus system
* around 15% of mothers are rhesus negative (Rh \-ve)
* if a Rh \-ve mother delivers a Rh \+ve child a leak of fetal red blood cells may occur
* this causes anti\-D IgG antibodies to form in mother
* in later pregnancies these can cross placenta and cause haemolysis in fetus
* this can also occur in the first pregnancy due to leaks

  
Prevention  
* test for D antibodies in all Rh \-ve mothers at booking
* NICE (2008\) advise giving anti\-D to non\-sensitised Rh \-ve mothers at 28 and 34 weeks
* the evidence base suggests that there is little difference in the efficacy of single\-dose (at 28 weeks) and double\-dose regimes (at 28 \& 34 weeks). For this reason the RCOG in 2011 advised that either regime could be used 'depending on local factors'
* anti\-D is prophylaxis \- once sensitization has occurred it is irreversible
* if event is in 2nd/3rd trimester give large dose of anti\-D and perform Kleihauer test \- determines proportion of fetal RBCs present

  
Anti\-D immunoglobulin should be given as soon as possible (but always within 72 hours) in the following situations:  
* delivery of a Rh \+ve infant, whether live or stillborn
* any termination of pregnancy
* miscarriage if gestation is \> 12 weeks
* ectopic pregnancy (if managed surgically, if managed medically with methotrexate anti\-D is not required)
* external cephalic version
* antepartum haemorrhage
* amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, fetal blood sampling
* abdominal trauma

  
Tests  
* all babies born to Rh \-ve mother should have cord blood taken at delivery for FBC, blood group \& direct Coombs test
* Coombs test: direct antiglobulin, will demonstrate antibodies on RBCs of baby
* Kleihauer test: add acid to maternal blood, fetal cells are resistant

  
Affected fetus  
* oedematous (hydrops fetalis, as liver devoted to RBC production albumin falls)
* jaundice, anaemia, hepatosplenomegaly
* heart failure
* kernicterus
* treatment: transfusions, UV phototherapy
