Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is defined as blood loss of \> 500 ml after a vaginal delivery and may be primary or secondary.  
  
Primary postpartum haemorrhage
------------------------------

  
Primary PPH occurs within 24 hours. It affects around 5\-7% of deliveries.   
  
The causes of PPH are said to be the 4 Ts:  
* **T**one (uterine atony): the vast majority of cases
* **T**rauma (e.g. perineal tear)
* **T**issue (retained placenta)
* **T**hrombin (e.g. clotting/bleeding disorder)

  
Risk factors for primary PPH include\*:  
* previous PPH
* prolonged labour
* pre\-eclampsia
* increased maternal age
* polyhydramnios
* emergency Caesarean section
* placenta praevia, placenta accreta
* macrosomia
* the effect of parity on the risk of PPH is complicated. It was previously thought multiparity was a risk factor but more modern studies suggest nulliparity is actually a risk factor

  
Management  
* PPH is a life\-threatening emergency \- senior members of staff should be involved immediately
* ABC approach
	+ two peripheral cannulae, 14 gauge
	+ lie the woman flat
	+ bloods including group and save
	+ commence warmed crystalloid infusion
* mechanical
	+ palpate the uterine fundus and rub it to stimulate contractions ('rubbing up the fundus')
	+ catheterisation to prevent bladder distension and monitor urine output
* medical
	+ IV oxytocin: slow IV injection followed by an IV infusion
	+ ergometrine slow IV or IM (unless there is a history of hypertension)
	+ carboprost IM (unless there is a history of asthma)
	+ misoprostol sublingual
	+ there is also interest in the role tranexamic acid may play in PPH
* surgical: if medical options fail to control the bleeding then surgical options will need to be urgently considered
	+ the RCOG state that the intrauterine balloon tamponade is an appropriate first\-line 'surgical' intervention for most women where uterine atony is the only or main cause of haemorrhage
	+ other options include: B\-Lynch suture, ligation of the uterine arteries or internal iliac arteries
	+ if severe, uncontrolled haemorrhage then a hysterectomy is sometimes performed as a life\-saving procedure

  
Secondary postpartum haemorrhage
--------------------------------

  
Secondary PPH occurs between 24 hours \- 12 weeks. It is typically due to retained placental tissue or endometritis.
