Placenta accreta describes the attachment of the placenta to the myometrium, due to a defective decidua basalis. As the placenta does not properly separate during labour there is a risk of postpartum haemorrhage.  
  
Risk factors  
* previous caesarean section
* placenta praevia

  
Strictly speaking, there are 3 different types of placenta accreta, depending on the degree of invasion although this is quite small print:  
* accreta: chorionic villi attach to the myometrium, rather than being restricted within the decidua basalis
* increta: chorionic villi invade into the myometrium
* percreta: chorionic villi invade through the perimetrium
