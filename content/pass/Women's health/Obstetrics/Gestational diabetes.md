Diabetes mellitus may be a pre\-existing problem or develop during pregnancy, gestational diabetes. It complicates up to 1 in 20 pregnancies. NICE estimates the following breakdown:  
* 87\.5% have gestational diabetes
* 7\.5% have type 1 diabetes
* 5% have type 2 diabetes

  
Gestational diabetes
--------------------

  
Gestational diabetes is the second most common medical disorder complicating pregnancy (after hypertension), affecting around 4% of pregnancies.  
  
Risk factors for gestational diabetes  
* BMI of \> 30 kg/mÂ²
* previous macrosomic baby weighing 4\.5 kg or above
* previous gestational diabetes
* first\-degree relative with diabetes
* family origin with a high prevalence of diabetes (South Asian, black Caribbean and Middle Eastern)

  
Screening for gestational diabetes  
* the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is the test of choice
* women who've previously had gestational diabetes: OGTT should be performed as soon as possible after booking and at 24\-28 weeks if the first test is normal. NICE also recommend that early self\-monitoring of blood glucose is an alternative to the OGTTs
* women with any of the other risk factors should be offered an OGTT at 24\-28 weeks

  
Diagnostic thresholds for gestational diabetes  
* these have recently been updated by NICE, gestational diabetes is diagnosed if either:
* fasting glucose is \>\= 5\.6 mmol/L
* 2\-hour glucose is \>\= 7\.8 mmol/L

  
Management of gestational diabetes  
* newly diagnosed women should be seen in a joint diabetes and antenatal clinic within a week
* women should be taught about self\-monitoring of blood glucose
* advice about diet (including eating foods with a low glycaemic index) and exercise should be given
* if the fasting plasma glucose level is \< 7 mmol/l a trial of diet and exercise should be offered
	+ if glucose targets are not met within 1\-2 weeks of altering diet/exercise metformin should be started
	+ if glucose targets are still not met insulin should be added to diet/exercise/metformin
	+ gestational diabetes is treated with short\-acting, not long\-acting, insulin
* if at the time of diagnosis the fasting glucose level is \>\= 7 mmol/l insulin should be started
* if the plasma glucose level is between 6\-6\.9 mmol/l, and there is evidence of complications such as macrosomia or hydramnios, insulin should be offered
* glibenclamide should only be offered for women who cannot tolerate metformin or those who fail to meet the glucose targets with metformin but decline insulin treatment

  
Management of pre\-existing diabetes  
* weight loss for women with BMI of \> 27 kg/m^2
* stop oral hypoglycaemic agents, apart from metformin, and commence insulin
* folic acid 5 mg/day from pre\-conception to 12 weeks gestation
* detailed anomaly scan at 20 weeks including four\-chamber view of the heart and outflow tracts
* tight glycaemic control reduces complication rates
* treat retinopathy as can worsen during pregnancy

  
Targets for self monitoring of pregnant women (pre\-existing and gestational diabetes)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  


| Time | Target |
| --- | --- |
| Fasting | 5\.3 mmol/l |
| 1 hour after meals | 7\.8 mmol/l, or: |
| 2 hour after meals | 6\.4 mmol/l |
