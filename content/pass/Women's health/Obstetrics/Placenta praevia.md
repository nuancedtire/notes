Placenta praevia describes a placenta lying wholly or partly in the lower uterine segment  
  
Epidemiology  
* 5% will have low\-lying placenta when scanned at 16\-20 weeks gestation
* incidence at delivery is only 0\.5%, therefore most placentas rise away from the cervix

  
Associated factors  
* multiparity
* multiple pregnancy
* embryos are more likely to implant on a lower segment scar from previous caesarean section

  
Clinical features  
* shock in proportion to visible loss
* no pain
* uterus not tender
* lie and presentation may be abnormal
* fetal heart usually normal
* coagulation problems rare
* small bleeds before large

  
Diagnosis  
* digital vaginal examination should not be performed before an ultrasound as it may provoke a severe haemorrhage
* placenta praevia is often picked up on the routine 20 week abdominal ultrasound
* the RCOG recommend the use of transvaginal ultrasound as it improves the accuracy of placental localisation and is considered safe

  
Classical grading  
* I \- placenta reaches lower segment but not the internal os
* II \- placenta reaches internal os but doesn't cover it
* III \- placenta covers the internal os before dilation but not when dilated
* IV ('major') \- placenta completely covers the internal os
