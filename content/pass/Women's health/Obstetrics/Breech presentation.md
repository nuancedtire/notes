In a breech presentation the caudal end of the fetus occupies the lower segment. Whilst around 25% of pregnancies at 28 weeks are breech it only occurs in 3% of babies near term. A frank breech is the most common presentation with the hips flexed and knees fully extended. A footling breech, where one or both feet come first with the bottom at a higher position, is rare but carries a higher perinatal morbidity  
  
Risk factors for breech presentation  
* uterine malformations, fibroids
* placenta praevia
* polyhydramnios or oligohydramnios
* fetal abnormality (e.g. CNS malformation, chromosomal disorders)
* prematurity (due to increased incidence earlier in gestation)

  
Cord prolapse is more common in breech presentations  
  
Management  
* if \< 36 weeks: many fetuses will turn spontaneously
* if still breech at 36 weeks NICE recommend external cephalic version (ECV)\- this has a success rate of around 60%. The RCOG recommend ECV should be offered from 36 weeks in nulliparous women and from 37 weeks in multiparous women
* if the baby is still breech then delivery options include planned caesarean section or vaginal delivery

  
Information to help decision making \- the RCOG recommend:  
* 'Women should be informed that planned caesarean section carries a reduced perinatal mortality and early neonatal morbidity for babies with a breech presentation at term compared with planned vaginal birth.'
* 'Women should be informed that there is no evidence that the long term health of babies with a breech presentation delivered at term is influenced by how the baby is born.'

  
RCOG absolute contraindications to ECV:  
* where caesarean delivery is required
* antepartum haemorrhage within the last 7 days
* abnormal cardiotocography
* major uterine anomaly
* ruptured membranes
* multiple pregnancy
