Intrauterine contraceptive devices comprise both conventional copper intrauterine devices (IUDs) and levonorgestrel\-releasing intrauterine systems (IUS, Mirenaµ). The IUS is also used in the management of menorrhagia  
  
Effectiveness  
* both the IUD and IUS are more than 99% effective

  
Mode of action  
* IUD: primary mode of action is prevention of fertilisation by causing decreased sperm motility and survival (possibly an effect of copper ions)
* IUS: levonorgestrel prevents endometrial proliferation and causes cervical mucous thickening

  
Counselling  
* IUD
	+ can be relied upon immediately following insertion
	+ the majority of IUDs with copper on the stem only are effective for 5 years, whereas some of the IUDs that have copper on the stem and the arms of the T may be effective for up to 10 years
* IUS
	+ can be relied upon after 7 days
	+ the most common IUS (i.e. Mirenaµ \- levonorgestrel 20 mcg/24 hrs) is effective for 5 years
	+ if used as endometrial protection for women taking oestrogen\-only hormone replacement therapy they are only licensed for 4 years

  
Potential problems  
* IUDs make periods heavier, longer and more painful
* the IUS is associated with initial frequent uterine bleeding and spotting. Later women typically have intermittent light menses with less dysmenorrhoea and some women become amenorrhoeic
* uterine perforation: up to 2 per 1000 insertions and higher in breastfeeding women
* the proportion of pregnancies that are ectopic is increased but the absolute number of ectopic pregnancies is reduced, compared to a woman not using contraception
* infection: there is a small increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease in the first 20 days after insertion but after this period the risk returns to that of a standard population
* expulsion: risk is around 1 in 20, and is most likely to occur in the first 3 months

  
New IUS systems
---------------

  
The Jaydessµ IUS is licensed for 3 years. It has a smaller frame, narrower inserter tube and less levonorgestrel (LNG) than the Mirenaµ coil (13\.5 mg compared to 52 mg). This results in lower serum levels of LNG.  
  
The Kyleenaµ IUS has 19\.5mg LNG and is also smaller than the Mirenaµ but is licensed for 5 years. It also results in lower serum levels of LNG. The rate of amenorrhoea is less with Kyleenaµ compared to Mirenaµ.
