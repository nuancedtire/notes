The missed pill rules for the progestogen only pill (POP) are simpler than those used for the combined oral contraceptive pill, but it is important not to confuse the two.  
  


| **'Traditional' POPs (Micronor, Noriday, Nogeston, Femulen)** | **Cerazette (desogestrel)** |
| --- | --- |
| If less than 3 hours late * no action required, continue as normal  If more than 3 hours late (i.e. more than 27 hours since the last pill was taken)* action needed \- see below | If less than 12 hours late * no action required, continue as normal  If more than 12 hours late (i.e. more than 36 hours since the last pill was taken)* action needed \- see below |

  
Action required, if needed:  
* take the missed pill as soon as possible. If more than one pill has been missed just take one pill. Take the next pill at the usual time, which may mean taking two pills in one day
* continue with rest of pack
* extra precautions (e.g. condoms) should be used until pill taking has been re\-established for 48 hours
