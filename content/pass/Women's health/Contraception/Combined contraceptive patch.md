The Evra patch is the only combined contraceptive patch licensed for use in the UK. The patch cycle lasts 4 weeks. For the first 3 weeks, the patch is worn everyday and needs to be changed each week. During the 4th week, the patch is not worn and during this time there will be a withdrawal bleed.   
  
For delays in changing the patch, different rules apply depending what week of the patch cycle the woman is in.  
  
If the patch change is delayed at the end of week 1 or week 2:  
  
If the delay in changing the patch is less than 48 hours, it should be changed immediately and no further precautions are needed.   
  
If the delay is greater than 48 hours, the patch should be changed immediately and a barrier method of contraception used for the next 7 days. If the woman has had sexual intercourse during this extended patch\-free interval or if unprotected sexual intercourse has occurred in the last 5 days, then emergency contraception needs to be considered.  
  
If the patch removal is delayed at the end of week 3:  
  
The patch should be removed as soon as possible and the new patch applied on the usual cycle start day for the next cycle, even if withdrawal bleeding is occurring. No additional contraception is needed.  
  
If patch application is delayed at the end of a patch\-free week, additional barrier contraception should be used for 7 days following any delay at the start of a new patch cycle.
