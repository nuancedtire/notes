After giving birth, women require contraception after day 21.  
  
Progestogen\-only pill (POP)  
* the FSRH advise 'postpartum women (breastfeeding and non\-breastfeeding) can start the POP at any time postpartum.'
* after day 21 additional contraception should be used for the first 2 days
* a small amount of progestogen enters breast milk but this is not harmful to the infant

  
Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP)  
* absolutely contraindicated \- UKMEC 4 \- if breastfeeding \< 6 weeks post\-partum
* UKMEC 2 \- if breastfeeding 6 weeks \- 6 months postpartum\*
* the COCP may reduce breast milk production in lactating mothers
* should not be used in the first 21 days due to the increased venous thromboembolism risk post\-partum
* after day 21 additional contraception should be used for the first 7 days

  
The intrauterine device or intrauterine system can be inserted within 48 hours of childbirth or after 4 weeks.  
  
Lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM)  
* is 98% effective providing the woman is fully breast\-feeding (no supplementary feeds), amenorrhoeic and \< 6 months post\-partum

  
An inter\-pregnancy interval of less than 12 months between childbirth and conceiving again is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight and small for gestational age babies.  
  
\*this changed from UKMEC 3 in 2016
