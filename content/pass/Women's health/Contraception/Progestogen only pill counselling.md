Women who are considering taking the progestogen\-only pill (POP) should be counselled in a number of areas:  
  
Potential adverse effects  
* irregular vaginal bleeding is the most common problem

  
Starting the POP  
* if commenced up to and including day 5 of the cycle it provides immediate protection, otherwise additional contraceptive methods (e.g. condoms) should be used for the first 2 days
* if switching from a combined oral contraceptive (COC) gives immediate protection if continued directly from the end of a pill packet (i.e. Day 21\)

  
Taking the POP  
* should be taken at the same time every day, without a pill\-free break (unlike the COC)

  
Missed pills  
* if \< 3 hours\* late: continue as normal
* if \> 3 hours\*: take the missed pill as soon as possible, continue with the rest of the pack, extra precautions (e.g. condoms) should be used until pill taking has been re\-established for 48 hours

  
Other potential problems  
* diarrhoea and vomiting: continue taking POP but assume pills have been missed \- see above
* antibiotics: have no effect on the POP\*\*
* liver enzyme inducers may reduce the effectiveness

  
Other information  
* discussion on STIs

  
\*for Cerazette (desogestrel) a 12 hour period is allowed  
  
\*\*unless the antibiotic alters the P450 enzyme system, for example, rifampicin
