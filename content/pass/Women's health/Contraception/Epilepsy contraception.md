There are a number of factors to consider for women with epilepsy:  
* the effect of the contraceptive on the effectiveness of the anti\-epileptic medication
* the effect of the anti\-epileptic on the effectiveness of the contraceptive
* the potential teratogenic effects of the anti\-epileptic if the woman becomes pregnant

  
Given the points above, the Faculty of Sexual \& Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) recommend the consistent use of condoms, in addition to other forms of contraception.  
  
For women taking phenytoin,carbamazepine, barbiturates, primidone, topiramate, oxcarbazepine:  
* UKMEC 3: the COCP and POP

For lamotrigine:  
* UKMEC 3: the COCP
* UKMEC 1: POP, implant, Depo\-Provera, IUD, IUS

  
If a COCP is chosen then it should contain a minimum of 30 Âµg of ethinylestradiol.
