* for many years doctors in the UK have advised that the concurrent use of antibiotics may interfere with the enterohepatic circulation of oestrogen and thus make the combined oral contraceptive pill ineffective \- 'extra\- precautions' were advised for the duration of antibiotic treatment and for 7 days afterwards
