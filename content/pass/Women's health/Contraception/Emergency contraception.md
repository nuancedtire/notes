There are two methods currently available in the UK:  
  
Emergency hormonal contraception
--------------------------------

  
There are now two methods of emergency hormonal contraception ('emergency pill', 'morning\-after pill'); levonorgestrel and ulipristal, a progesterone receptor modulator.  
  
Levonorgestrel  
* mode of action not fully understood \- acts both to stop ovulation and inhibit implantation
* should be taken as soon as possible \- efficacy decreases with time
* must be taken within  72 hours of unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI)
	+ may be offered after this period as long as the client is aware of reduced effectiveness and unlicensed indication
* single dose of levonorgestrel 1\.5mg (a progesterone)
	+ the dose should be doubled for those with a BMI \>26 or weight over 70kg
	+ dose should also be doubled if taking enzyme\-inducing drugs (although a copper IUD as emergency contraception is preferable in this situation)
* 84% effective if used within 72 hours of UPSI
* levonorgestrel is safe and well\-tolerated. Disturbance of the current menstrual cycle is seen in a significant minority of women. Vomiting occurs in around 1%
* if vomiting occurs within 3 hours then the dose should be repeated
* can be used more than once in a menstrual cycle if clinically indicated
* hormonal contraception can be started immediately after using levornogestrel (Levonelle) for emergency contraception

  
  
Ulipristal  
* a selective progesterone receptor modulator currently marketed as EllaOne. The primary mode of action is thought to be inhibition of ovulation
* 30mg oral dose taken as soon as possible, no later than 120 hours after intercourse
* concomitant use with levonorgestrel is not recommended
* Ulipristal may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraception. Contraception with the pill, patch or ring should be started, or restarted, 5 days after having ulipristal. Barrier methods should be used during this period
* caution should be exercised in patients with severe asthma
* ulipristal can be used more than once in the same cycle
* breastfeeding should be delayed for one week after taking ulipristal. There are no such restrictions on the use of levonorgestrel

  
**Intrauterine device (IUD)**  
* a copper IUD is the most effective method of emergency contraception and should be offered to all women if they meet the criteria
	+ if the criteria for insertion of a copper IUD are not met or is not acceptable to the woman, oral emergency contraception should be considered
	+ in practice the vast majority of women choose oral emergency contraception, but it is important to offer the choice to all women given how effective copper IUDs are
* must be inserted within 5 days of UPSI, or
* if a woman presents after more than 5 days then an IUD may be fitted up to 5 days after the likely ovulation date
* may inhibit fertilisation or implantation
* prophylactic antibiotics may be given if the patient is considered to be at high\-risk of sexually transmitted infection
* is 99% effective regardless of where it is used in the cycle
* may be left in\-situ to provide long\-term contraception. If the client wishes for the IUD to be removed it should be at least kept in until the next period
