Implanon was the original non\-biodegradable subdermal contraceptive implant which has been replaced by Nexplanon. From a pharmacological perspective Nexplanon is the same as Implanon. The two main differences are:  
* the applicator has been redesigned to try and prevent 'deep' insertions (i.e. subcutaneous/intramuscular)
* it is radiopaque and therefore easier to locate if impalpable

  
Both versions slowly releases the progestogen hormone etonogestrel. They are typically inserted in the proximal non\-dominant arm, just overlying the tricep. The main mechanism of action is preventing ovulation. They also work by thickening the cervical mucus.  
  
Key points  
* highly effective: failure rate 0\.07/100 women\-years \- it is the most effective form of contraception
* long\-acting: lasts 3 years
* doesn't contain oestrogen so can be used if past history of thromboembolism, migraine etc
* can be inserted immediately following a termination of pregnancy

  
Disadvantages include  
* the need for a trained professional to insert and remove device
* additional contraceptive methods are needed for the first 7 days if not inserted on day 1 to 5 of a woman's menstrual cycle

  
Adverse effects  
* **irregular/heavy bleeding** is the main problem: this is sometimes managed using a co\-prescription of the combined oral contraceptive pill. It should be remembered to do a speculum exam/STI check if the bleeding continues
* 'progestogen effects': headache, nausea, breast pain

  
Interactions  
* enzyme\-inducing drugs such as certain antiepileptic and rifampicin may reduce the efficacy of Nexplanon
* the FSRH advises that women should be advised to switch to a method unaffected by enzyme\-inducing drugs or to use additional contraception until 28 days after stopping the treatment

  
Contraindications  
* UKMEC 3\*: ischaemic heart disease/stroke (for continuation, if initiation then UKMEC 2\), unexplained, suspicious vaginal bleeding, past breast cancer, severe liver cirrhosis, liver cancer
* UKMEC 4\*\*: current breast cancer

  
  
\*proven risks generally outweigh the advantages  
\*\*a condition which represents an unacceptable risk if the contraceptive method is used
