The advice from the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare (FSRH) has changed over recent years. The following recommendations are now made for women taken a combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill containing 30\-35 micrograms of ethinylestradiol  
  
If 1 pill is missed (at any time in the cycle)  
* take the last pill even if it means taking two pills in one day and then continue taking pills daily, one each day
* no additional contraceptive protection needed

  
If 2 or more pills missed  
* take the last pill even if it means taking two pills in one day, leave any earlier missed pills and then continue taking pills daily, one each day
* the women should use condoms or abstain from sex until she has taken pills for 7 days in a row. FSRH: *'This advice may be overcautious in the second and third weeks, but the advice is a backup in the event that further pills are missed'*
* if pills are missed in week 1 (Days 1\-7\): emergency contraception should be considered if she had unprotected sex in the pill\-free interval or in week 1
* if pills are missed in week 2 (Days 8\-14\): after seven consecutive days of taking the COC there is no need for emergency contraception\*
* if pills are missed in week 3 (Days 15\-21\): she should finish the pills in her current pack and start a new pack the next day; thus omitting the pill free interval

  
\*theoretically women would be protected if they took the COC in a pattern of 7 days on, 7 days off
