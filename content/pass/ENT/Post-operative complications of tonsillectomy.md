Haemorrhage
-----------

  
Haemorrhage is a feared complication following tonsillectomy. All post\-tonsillectomy haemorrhages should be assessed by ENT.  
  
Primary, or reactionary haemorrhage most commonly occurs in the first 6\-8 hours following surgery. It is managed by immediate return to theatre.  
  
Secondary haemorrhage occurs between 5 and 10 days after surgery and is often associated with a wound infection. Treatment is usually with admission and antibiotics. Severe bleeding may require surgery. Secondary haemorrhage occurs in around 1\-2% of all tonsillectomies.
