3 pairs  
* parotid (serous) \- most tumours
* submandibular (mixed) \- most stones
* sublingual (mucous)

  
Pathology  
* tumours: '80% parotid, 80% of these \= pleomorphic adenomas, 80% superficial lobe
* malignant rare: short hx, painful, hot skin, hard, fixation, CN VII involvement

  
Pleomorphic adenomas (benign, 'mixed parotid tumour', 80%)  
* middle age
* slow growing, painless lump
* superficial parotidectomy; risk \= CN VII damage

  
Warthin's tumour (benign, 'adenolymphomas', 10%)  
* males, middle age
* softer, more mobile and fluctuant (although difficult to differentiate)

  
Stones  
* recurrent unilateral pain \& swelling on eating
* may become infected â†’ Ludwig's angina
* 80% are submandibular
* plain x\-rays; sialography
* surgical removal

* acute viral infection e.g. mumps
* acute bacterial infection e.g. 2nd to dehydration diabetes
