Facial pain is a common clinical presentation in both primary and secondary care settings. It can be associated with a wide range of conditions, from benign and self\-limiting to severe and life\-threatening. Understanding the underlying anatomy and physiology, as well as the differential diagnosis for facial pain, is essential for effective clinical management.  
  
  
Background
----------

  
The face is innervated by the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V), which has three main branches: the ophthalmic (V1\), maxillary (V2\), and mandibular (V3\) nerves. Pain sensation from the face travels via these nerves to the trigeminal nucleus in the brainstem before being relayed to higher cortical centres. Various structures in the face can give rise to pain including skin, muscles, sinuses, teeth, eyes and neural tissue.  
  
  
Differential Diagnosis
----------------------

 \- **Trigeminal Neuralgia:** Characterised by severe lancinating facial pain along one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve.  
 \- **Sinusitis:** Facial pain accompanied by symptoms such as nasal discharge or congestion suggests sinusitis.  
 \- **Dental Problems:** Dental caries or abscesses can cause localised facial pain.  
 \- **Tension\-Type Headache:** This may present with a band\-like pressure around the forehead that can extend into facial regions.  
 \- **Migraine:** Migraine headaches often involve unilateral throbbing head and face pain associated with nausea, vomiting or photophobia.  
 \- **Giant Cell Arteritis:** In older patients, new onset facial pain may be a sign of this condition, which can threaten vision.
