Tinnitus is the perception of sounds in the ears or head that do not come from an outside source. Around 1 in 10 people will experience an episode of tinnitus at some point in their life. Although sometimes considered a 'minor' symptom of 'ringing in the ears' it can be distressing to patients and may occasionally be a sign of a serious underlying condition.  
  
Causes of tinnitus include:  
  


| Condition | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| **Idiopathic** | An underlying cause will not be found in the majority of patients. |
| **Meniere's disease** | Associated with hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus and sensation of fullness or pressure in one or both ears |
| **Otosclerosis** | Onset is usually at 20\-40 yearsConductive deafnessTinnitusNormal tympanic membrane although 10% of patients may have a 'flamingo tinge', caused by hyperaemiaPositive family history |
| **Sudden onset sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL)** | The majority of SSNHL cases are diopathic |
| **Acoustic neuroma** | Hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitusAbsent corneal reflex is an important signAssociated with neurofibromatosis type 2 |
| **Hearing loss** | Causes include excessive loud noise and presbycusis |
| **Drugs** | Aspirin/NSAIDsAminoglycosidesLoop diureticsQuinine |
| **Impacted ear wax** | Usually obvious on otoscopy |

  
Assessment  
* audiological assessment
	+ detect underlying hearing loss
* imaging
	+ not all patients will require imaging. Generally, non\-pulsatile tinnitus does not require imaging unless it is unilateral or there are other neurological or otological signs. MRI of the internal auditory meatuses (IAM) is first\-line
	+ pulsatile tinnitus generally requires imaging as there may be an underlying vascular cause. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is often used to investigate pulsatile tinnitus

  
Management  
* investigate and treat any underlying cause
* amplification devices
	+ more beneficial if associated hearing loss
* psychological therapy may help a limited group of patients
	+ examples include cognitive behavioural therapy
* tinnitus support groups
