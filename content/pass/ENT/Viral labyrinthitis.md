Labyrinthitis is an inflammatory disorder of the membranous labyrinth, affecting both the vestibular and cochlear end organs. Labyrinthitis can be viral, bacterial or associated with systemic diseases. Viral labyrinthitis is the most common form of labyrinthitis.   
  
Labyrinthitis should be distinguished from vestibular neuritis as there are important differences: vestibular neuritis is used to define cases in which only the vestibular nerve is involved, hence there is no hearing impairment; Labyrinthitis is used when both the vestibular nerve and the labyrinth are involved, usually resulting in both vertigo and hearing impairment.   
  
Epidemiology  
* The average age of presentation is 40\-70 years

  
Patients typically present with an acute onset of:  
* vertigo: not triggered by movement but exacerbated by movement
* nausea and vomiting
* hearing loss: may be unilateral or bilateral, with varying severity
* tinnitus
* preceding or concurrent symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection

  
Signs of labyrinthitis:  
* spontaneous unidirectional horizontal nystagmus towards the unaffected side
* sensorineural hearing loss: shown by Rinne's test and Weber test
* abnormal head impulse test: signifies an impaired vestibulo\-ocular reflex
* gait disturbance: the patient may fall towards the affected side

   
The diagnosis is largely based on history and examination.  
  
Management  
* episodes are usually self\-limiting
* prochlorperazine or antihistamines may help reduce the sensation of dizziness
