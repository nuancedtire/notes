Sore throat encompasses pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and laryngitis.  
  
Clinical Knowledge Summaries recommend:  
* throat swabs and rapid antigen tests should not be carried out routinely in patients with a sore throat

  
Management  
* paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain relief
* antibiotics are not routinely indicated
* there is some evidence that a single dose of oral corticosteroid may reduce the severity and duration of pain, although this has not yet been incorporated into UK guidelines

  
NICE indications for antibiotics  
* features of marked systemic upset secondary to the acute sore throat
* unilateral peritonsillitis
* a history of rheumatic fever
* an increased risk from acute infection (such as a child with diabetes mellitus or immunodeficiency)
* patients with acute sore throat/acute pharyngitis/acute tonsillitis when 3 or more Centor criteria are present

  
Scoring systems
---------------

  
The **Centor criteria** are: score 1 point for each (maximum score of 4\)  
* presence of tonsillar exudate
* tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy or lymphadenitis
* history of fever
* absence of cough

  


| Centor score | Likelihood of isolating *Streptococci* |
| --- | --- |
| 0 or 1 or 2 | 3 to 17% |
| 3 or 4 | 32 to 56% |

  
The **FeverPAIN criteria** are: score 1 point for each (maximum score of 5\)  
* Fever over 38Â°C.
* Purulence (pharyngeal/tonsillar exudate).
* Attend rapidly (3 days or less)
* Severely Inflamed tonsils
* No cough or coryza

  


| FeverPAIN score | Likelihood of isolating *Streptococci* |
| --- | --- |
| 0 or 1 | 13 to 18% |
| 2 or 3 | 34% to 40% |
| 4 or 5 | 62% to 65% |

  
If antibiotics are indicated then either phenoxymethylpenicillin or clarithromycin (if the patient is penicillin\-allergic) should be given.
