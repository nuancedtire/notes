Complications of tonsillitis include:  
* otitis media
* quinsy \- peritonsillar abscess
* rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis very rarely

  
The indications for tonsillectomy are controversial. NICE recommend that surgery should be considered only if the person meets all of the following criteria  
* sore throats are due to tonsillitis (i.e. not recurrent upper respiratory tract infections)
* the person has 7 episodes per year for one year, 5 per year for 2 years, or 3 per year for 3 years, and for whom there is no other explanation for the recurrent symptoms)
* the episodes of sore throat are disabling and prevent normal functioning

  
Other established indications for a tonsillectomy include  
* recurrent febrile convulsions secondary to episodes of tonsillitis
* obstructive sleep apnoea, stridor or dysphagia secondary to enlarged tonsils
* peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) if unresponsive to standard treatment

  
Complications of tonsillectomy  
* primary (\< 24 hours): haemorrhage in 2\-3% (most commonly due to inadequate haemostasis), pain
* secondary (24 hours to 10 days): haemorrhage (most commonly due to infection), pain
