Presbycusis is a type of sensorineural hearing loss that affects elderly individuals. Typically, high\-frequency hearing is affected bilaterally, which can lead to conversational difficulties, particularly in noisy environments. Presbycusis progresses slowly, as sensory hair cells and neurons in the cochlea atrophy over time. Although certain factors are associated with presbycusis, it is distinct from noise\-related hearing loss.  
  
Epidemiology  
* In the USA, it is estimated that 25\-30% of 65\-74 year\-olds have impaired hearing. For those over 75 years, the incidence is 40\-50%
* The age of presentation varies, however, prevalence increases with age
* Males are at slightly higher risk of developing presbycusis compared to females (55%:45%)

  
Causes   
* The precise cause is unknown however is likely multifactorial
* Arteriosclerosis: May cause diminished perfusion and oxygenation of the cochlea, resulting in damage to inner ear structures
* Diabetes: Acceleration of arteriosclerosis
* Accumulated exposure to noise
* Drug exposure (Salicylates, chemotherapy agents etc.)
* Stress
* Genetic: Certain individuals may be programmed for the early ageing of the auditory system

  
Patients typically present with a chronic, slowly progressing history of:  
* Speech becoming difficult to understand
* Need for increased volume on the television or radio
* Difficulty using the telephone
* Loss of directionality of sound
* Worsening of symptoms in noisy environments
* Hyperacusis: Heightened sensitivity to certain frequencies of sound (Less common)
* Tinnitus (Uncommon)

  
Signs:  
* Possible Weber's test bone conduction localisation to one side if sensorineural hearing loss not completely bilateral

  
Investigations:  
* Otoscopy: *Normal, to rule out otosclerosis, cholesteatoma and conductive hearing loss (Foreign body, impacted wax etc.)*
* Tympanometry: *Normal middle ear function with hearing loss (Type A)*
* Audiometry: *Bilateral sensorineural pattern hearing loss*
* Blood tests including inflammatory markers and specific antibodies: *Normal*
