Sinusitis describes an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the paranasal sinuses. The sinuses are usually sterile \- the most common infectious agents seen in acute sinusitis are **Streptococcus* pneumoniae*, *Haemophilus influenzae* and rhinoviruses.  
  
Predisposing factors include:  
* nasal obstruction e.g. septal deviation or nasal polyps
* recent local infection e.g. rhinitis or dental extraction
* swimming/diving
* smoking

  
Features  
* facial pain
	+ typically frontal pressure pain which is worse on bending forward
* nasal discharge: usually thick and purulent
* nasal obstruction

  
Management of acute sinusitis  
* analgesia
* intranasal decongestants or nasal saline may be considered but the evidence supporting these is limited
* NICE CKS recommend that intranasal corticosteroids may be considered if the symptoms have been present for more than 10 days
* oral antibiotics are not normally required but may be given for severe presentations.
	+ The BNF recommends phenoxymethylpenicillin first\-line, co\-amoxiclav if 'systemically very unwell, signs and symptoms of a more serious illness, or at high\-risk of complications'
	+ 'double\-sickening' may sometimes be seen, where an initial viral sinusitis worsens due to secondary bacterial infection
