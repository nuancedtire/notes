The key to understanding thyroglossal cysts is to think about the name; thyro (thyroid) and glossal (tongue).  
  
Embryology
----------

  
The thyroid develops from the floor of the pharynx and descends into the neck during its development. It is connected to the tongue by the thyroglossal duct. The foramen cecum is the point of attachment of the thyroglossal duct to the tongue. The thyroglossal duct normally atrophies but in some people may persist and give rise to a thyroglossal duct cyst.  
  
Presentations
-------------

  
More common in patients \< 20 years old.  
  
Features  
* usually midline, between the isthmus of the thyroid and the hyoid bone
* moves upwards with protrusion of the tongue
* may be painful if infected
