Nasal septal haematoma is an important complication of nasal trauma that should always be looked for. It describes the development of a haematoma between the septal cartilage and the overlying perichondrium.  
  
Features  
* may be precipitated by relatively minor trauma
* the sensation of nasal obstruction is the most common symptom
* pain and rhinorrhoea are also seen
* on examination, classically a bilateral, red swelling arising from the nasal septum
* this may be differentiated from a deviated septum by gently probing the swelling. Nasal septal haematomas are typically boggy whereas septums will be firm

  
Management  
* surgical drainage
* intravenous antibiotics

  
If untreated irreversible septal necrosis may develop within 3\-4 days. This is thought to be due to pressure\-related ischaemia of the cartilage resulting in necrosis. This may result in a 'saddle\-nose' deformity
