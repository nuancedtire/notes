2 week wait referrals to oral surgery should be done in all of the following cases:  
* Unexplained oral ulceration or mass persisting for greater than 3 weeks
* Unexplained red, or red and white patches that are painful, swollen or bleeding
* Unexplained one\-sided pain in the head and neck area for greater than 4 weeks, which is associated with ear ache, but does not result in any abnormal findings on otoscopy
* Unexplained recent neck lump, or a previously undiagnosed lump that has changed over a period of 3 to 6 weeks
* Unexplained persistent sore or painful throat
* Signs and symptoms in the oral cavity persisting for more than 6 weeks, that cannot be definitively diagnosed as a benign lesion

  
The level of suspicion should be higher in patients who are over 40, smokers, heavy drinkers and those who chew tobacco or betel nut (areca nut).
