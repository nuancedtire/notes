The most common causes of hearing loss are ear wax, otitis media and otitis externa. The table below details some of the characteristic features of other causes:  
  


| **Condition** | **Key features** |
| --- | --- |
| **Presbycusis** | Presbycusis describes age\-related sensorineural hearing loss. Patients may describe difficulty following conversationsAudiometry shows bilateral high\-frequency hearing loss |
| **Otosclerosis** | Autosomal dominant, replacement of normal bone by vascular spongy bone. Onset is usually at 20\-40 years \- features include:* conductive deafness * tinnitus * tympanic membrane \- 10% of patients may have a 'flamingo tinge', caused by hyperaemia * positive family history |
| **Glue ear** | Also known as otitis media with effusion* peaks at 2 years of age * hearing loss is usually the presenting feature (glue ear is the commonest cause of conductive hearing loss and elective surgery in childhood) * secondary problems such as speech and language delay, behavioural or balance problems may also be seen |
| **Meniere's disease** | More common in middle\-aged adults* recurrent episodes of vertigo, tinnitus and hearing loss (sensorineural). Vertigo is usually the prominent symptom * a sensation of aural fullness or pressure is now recognised as being common * other features include nystagmus and a positive Romberg test * episodes last minutes to hours |
| **Drug ototoxicity** | Examples include aminoglycosides (e.g. Gentamicin), furosemide, aspirin and a number of cytotoxic agents |
| **Noise damage** | Workers in heavy industry are particularly at riskHearing loss is bilateral and typically is worse at frequencies of 3000\-6000 Hz |
| **Acoustic neuroma** (more correctly called vestibular schwannomas) | Features can be predicted by the affected cranial nerves* cranial nerve VIII: hearing loss, vertigo, tinnitus * cranial nerve V: absent corneal reflex * cranial nerve VII: facial palsy  Bilateral acoustic neuromas are seen in neurofibromatosis type 2 |
