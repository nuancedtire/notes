The most common cause of a perforated tympanic membrane is infection. Other causes include barotrauma or direct trauma.  
  
A perforated tympanic membrane may lead to hearing loss depending on the size and also increase the risk of otitis media.  
  
Management  
* no treatment is needed in the majority of cases as the tympanic membrane will usually heal after 6\-8 weeks. It is advisable to avoid getting water in the ear during this time
* it is common practice to prescribe antibiotics to perforations which occur following an episode of acute otitis media. NICE support this approach in the 2008 Respiratory tract infection guidelines
* myringoplasty may be performed if the tympanic membrane does not heal by itself
