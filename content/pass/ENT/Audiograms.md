Audiograms are usually the first\-line investigation that is performed when a patient complains of hearing difficulties. They are relatively easy to interpret as long as some simple rules are followed:  
* anything above the 20dB line is essentially normal (marked in green on the audiogram below)
* in sensorineural hearing loss both air and bone conduction are impaired
* in conductive hearing loss only air conduction is impaired
* in mixed hearing loss both air and bone conduction are impaired, with air conduction often being 'worse' than bone

This audiogram is essentially normal. Note all the values are above the 20dB line, highlighted in green on this image
