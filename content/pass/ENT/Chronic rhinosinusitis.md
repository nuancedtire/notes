Chronic rhinosinusitis affects up to 1 in 10 people. It is generally defined as an inflammatory disorder of the paranasal sinuses and linings of the nasal passages that lasts 12 weeks or longer.  
  
Predisposing factors include:  
* atopy: hay fever, asthma
* nasal obstruction e.g. Septal deviation or nasal polyps
* recent local infection e.g. Rhinitis or dental extraction
* swimming/diving
* smoking

  
Features  
* facial pain: typically frontal pressure pain which is worse on bending forward
* nasal discharge: usually clear if allergic or vasomotor. Thicker, purulent discharge suggests secondary infection
* nasal obstruction: e.g. 'mouth breathing'
* post\-nasal drip: may produce chronic cough

  
Management of recurrent or chronic sinusitis  
* avoid allergen
* intranasal corticosteroids
* nasal irrigation with saline solution

  
Red flags symptoms  
* unilateral symptoms
* persistent symptoms despite compliance with 3 months of treatment
* epistaxis
