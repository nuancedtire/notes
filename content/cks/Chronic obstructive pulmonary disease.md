## Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Summary

- **Definition**: COPD is a common, treatable (but not curable), and largely preventable lung condition characterized by:
  - Persistent respiratory symptoms
  - Airflow obstruction (progressive and not fully reversible)

- **Risk Factors**: 
  - Major risk factor: Tobacco smoking

- **Complications**:
  - Reduced quality of life
  - Increased morbidity and mortality

- **Diagnosis**: 
  - Based on clinical features and spirometry
  - Suspected in individuals over 35 years with risk factors and symptoms:
    - Exertional breathlessness
    - Chronic/recurrent cough
    - Regular sputum production
  - Confirmed by post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio < 0.7

- **Investigations**: 
  - Chest X-ray
  - Full blood count (to exclude other causes)

- **Management**: Upon diagnosis, offer:
  - Information about COPD and risk factors for progression
  - Smoking cessation support (if applicable)
  - Pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations
  - Pulmonary rehabilitation (if applicable)
  - Treatment for comorbidities (e.g., anxiety, depression)
  - Self-management plan

- **Initial Treatment**:
  - Short-acting bronchodilator (SABA) or short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) as needed

- **Stepwise Approach for Uncontrolled Symptoms**:
  - Consider long-acting bronchodilators (LABAs, LAMAs) or inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs)
  - ICSs should be combined with long-acting bronchodilator (risk of pneumonia)

- **Referral to Specialist**: Indicated for:
  - Suspected lung cancer, cor pulmonale, or bronchiectasis
  - Very severe or rapidly worsening COPD
  - Patients under 40 years or with a family history of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
  - Diagnostic uncertainty
  - Consideration of oxygen therapy, long-term non-invasive ventilation, long-term oral corticosteroids, or lung surgery

- **Referral for Pulmonary Rehabilitation**: If the patient:
  - Is functionally disabled by COPD
  - Recently hospitalized for acute exacerbation

- **Emergency Admission Considerations**: For acute exacerbations with:
  - Severe breathlessness
  - Inability to cope at home
  - Poor/deteriorating condition
  - Acute confusion or impaired consciousness
  - Cyanosis or reduced oxygen saturation
  - Worsening peripheral edema
  - New arrhythmia

- **Management of Acute Exacerbations (not requiring admission)**:
  - Advise increased dose/frequency of short-acting bronchodilators
  - Consider oral corticosteroids and antibiotics
  - Advise when to seek medical help; reassess if symptoms worsen

- **Follow-Up**: 
  - Regular follow-up based on symptom severity
  - Discuss end-of-life issues and offer advance care planning when appropriate
