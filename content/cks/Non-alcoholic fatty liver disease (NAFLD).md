## Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) Summary

- **Definition**: Excess fat accumulation (steatosis) in the liver without excessive alcohol consumption.
- **Alcohol Consumption Cut-off**: 
  - Women: < 20g (2.5 units) per day
  - Men: < 30g (3.75 units) per day

- **Spectrum of Disease**: 
  - **Simple Steatosis**: Up to 90% of cases, generally good prognosis.
  - **Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)**: Risk of progression to advanced liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular cancer.

- **Symptoms**: Often asymptomatic; may include fatigue, malaise, abdominal discomfort.

- **Prevalence**: Most common cause of abnormal liver blood tests in the UK.

- **Metabolic Risk Factors**: 
  - Hypertension
  - Impaired glucose regulation/type 2 diabetes
  - Central obesity
  - Hyperlipidaemia

- **Direct Liver Complications**:
  - Portal hypertension
  - Variceal hemorrhage
  - Liver failure
  - Hepatocellular carcinoma

- **Metabolic Complications**: 
  - Cardiovascular disease (most common cause of death in NAFLD patients)
  - Impaired glucose regulation
  - Type 2 diabetes

- **Diagnosis**: 
  - Suspected if:
    - Risk factors present
    - Elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) for at least 3 months (up to 3x upper limit of normal) exceeding aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
    - Upper abdominal ultrasound shows fatty liver changes
  - Note: LFTs and ultrasound may appear normal.

- **Next Steps if NAFLD is Suspected**:
  - Arrange blood tests to exclude other liver disease causes and assess metabolic complications.
  - Assess risk of advanced liver fibrosis using:
    - NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS)
    - Fibrosis (FIB)-4 score
    - Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) test
  - Assess cardiovascular disease risk with validated tools.

- **Primary Care Management**:
  - Lifestyle modification advice: diet, physical activity, exercise for gradual weight loss (especially if overweight/obese).
  - Advise on alcohol consumption within national limits.
  - Optimize management of associated conditions (hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, type 2 diabetes).
  - Provide information and support resources (e.g., British Liver Trust).

- **Follow-up Care**:
  - Examine for advanced liver disease signs; check BMI and blood pressure.
  - Blood tests for associated metabolic conditions.
  - Annual cardiovascular disease risk reassessment; advanced liver fibrosis risk every 3 years.

- **Referral to Liver Specialist Considered If**:
  - High risk of advanced liver fibrosis.
  - Signs of advanced liver disease.
  - Uncertainty about the diagnosis.
