## Herpes Simplex - Oral: Quick Revision

### Overview
- **Oral HSV**: Typically mild, self-limiting infection.
- **Common Forms**: 
  - **Herpes labialis** (cold sores)
  - **Gingivostomatitis** (oral mucosa infection)
- **Causes**: 
  - **HSV-1**: >90% of cases.
  - **HSV-2**: Rarely involved.

### Transmission
- **Mode**: Direct contact with infected secretions.
- **Source**: Active shedding from an infected person.

### Complications
- Severe in immunocompromised individuals:
  - Eczema herpeticum
  - Eye disease (e.g., corneal ulceration)
  - Erythema multiforme
  - Pneumonia
  - Encephalitis

### Symptoms
- **Primary Infection**: 
  - Gingivostomatitis in children.
  - Prodrome: Fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy.
  - Initial symptoms: Pain, burning, tingling, itching (6â€“48 hours before lesions).
  
- **Lesion Characteristics**:
  - **Herpes labialis**: Crops of vesicles that rupture, ulcerate, crust, and heal (usually no scarring).
  - **Gingivostomatitis**: Painful vesicles that rupture and form ulcers in the oral cavity.

### Diagnosis
- Based on age, clinical features, history, location, and appearance of lesions.

### Assessment
- Consider known triggers (e.g., UV light, stress, fever, trauma).
- Look for red flags for oral cancer.
- Investigations are typically not needed in primary care.

### Management
- **Hospital Admission**: If unable to swallow, dehydrated, or serious complications suspected.
- **Specialist Referral**: If immunocompromised, pregnant, or experiencing severe, recurrent, or atypical infections.

### Treatment Options
- **Analgesia**: For pain and fever.
- **Antivirals**: 
  - Consider aciclovir or valaciclovir for:
    - Healthy individuals with primary or recurrent infections.
    - Immunocompromised individuals.
- **Topical Treatments**: Not routinely recommended but may be helpful for some (available OTC).
  
### Self-Care Advice
- Avoid known trigger factors.
- Reduce risk of autoinoculation and transmission.
- Use sunscreen or sunblock lip balm for sunlight-triggered infections.
