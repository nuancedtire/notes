## [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Appendicitis|Appendicitis]] Summary

### Definition
- Acute inflammation of the appendix (small tube connected to the caecum).

### Aetiology and Pathogenesis
- **Unknown Causes**: Mainly thought to be due to luminal obstruction (about 50% of cases).
- **Common Causes of Obstruction**:
  - Faecolith (hard mass of faecal matter)
  - Lymphoid hyperplasia during infection
  - Impacted stool
  - Foreign body
  - Rarely, appendiceal or caecal tumour

### Consequences of Luminal Obstruction
- Distension of the appendix due to:
  - Increased mucus production
  - Bacterial overgrowth
  - Suppurative inflammation
- Impaired lymphatic and venous drainage leading to:
  - Ischaemia
  - Necrosis
  - Potential perforation

### Epidemiology
- Most common abdominal surgical emergency worldwide.
- Approximately 50,000 acute appendicectomies annually in the UK.
- Peak incidence: Second or third decade of life; reduced prevalence at extremes of age.

### Types of [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Appendicitis|Appendicitis]]
- **Uncomplicated** (non-perforating)
- **Complicated** (perforating)

### Complications from Delayed Diagnosis
- Perforation leading to:
  - Abscess formation
  - Peritonitis
  - Sepsis
  - Intra-abdominal adhesions
  - Bowel obstruction

### Natural Course
- While perforation is common, some cases may resolve spontaneously.

### Diagnostic Criteria
- **Symptoms**:
  - Periumbilical or epigastric pain worsening and migrating to the right lower quadrant over 24â€“48 hours (aggravated by movement).
  - Low-grade fever, malaise, and anorexia.
  - Nausea, vomiting, and sometimes constipation or diarrhoea.
  - Tenderness in the right lower quadrant (worse on coughing/hopping in children).
  - Possible abdominal distension, guarding, rebound tenderness, or absent bowel sounds (indicating peritonitis).
  - Palpable abdominal mass (suggesting appendix mass or abscess).

- **Note**: Atypical presentations may occur in the young, elderly, and pregnant women; anatomical variations can affect clinical presentation.

### Management
- **Suspected [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Appendicitis|Appendicitis]]**:
  - Emergency admission for specialist assessment.
  - Possible further imaging.
  - Non-operative management (antibiotics) or operative management (appendicectomy, percutaneous drainage).

- **Unlikely [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Appendicitis|Appendicitis]]**:
  - Consider additional investigations in primary care.
  - Advise on symptoms to monitor and when to seek urgent medical review.
