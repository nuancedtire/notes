## Headache - Assessment Summary

### Classification of Headache
1. **Primary Headaches** (majority):
   - Not associated with an underlying condition.
   - Includes:
     - **Migraine**
     - **Tension-type headache**
     - **Trigeminal autonomic cephalgias** (e.g., cluster headache)
  
2. **Secondary Headaches**:
   - Precipitated by another condition or disorder.
   - Examples include:
     - Head or neck trauma
     - Cranial or cervical vascular disorders (e.g., stroke, temporal arteritis)
     - CNS malignancy
     - Substance exposure or withdrawal (e.g., medication overuse headache)
     - Infection (intracranial or systemic)
     - Disorders of facial or cranial structures (e.g., eyes, ears, sinuses, teeth)
     - Psychiatric disorders

3. **Other Headaches**:
   - Painful cranial neuropathies and facial pains (e.g., trigeminal neuralgia, post-herpetic neuralgia)

### Clinical Relevance
- Headache is a common reason for emergency department visits in the UK.

### Assessment of Headache
**Key Areas to Explore:**
- **Red Flags**: Indicators of serious secondary causes requiring specialist assessment.
- **Headache Characteristics**:
  - Onset, duration, frequency, pattern
  - Location, severity, quality of pain
- **Associated Symptoms**:
  - Aura, nausea/vomiting, motion sensitivity, photophobia/phonophobia (suggestive of migraine)
  - Autonomic features (e.g., lacrimation, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhoea - suggestive of cluster headache)
- **Triggers and Relieving Factors**:
  - Trauma, posture, Valsalva manoeuvre, menstrual cycle, substances (caffeine, alcohol)
- **Comorbidities**:
  - Malignancy, immunosuppression
- **Medications**:
  - Symptom relief medications (e.g., ergotamines, triptans, opioids)
  - Risk of medication overuse headache
- **Impact**: Effect on daily activities and quality of life

### Examination
- **Vital Signs**: Check mental state and alertness
- **Physical Examination**: Neck, facial, extracranial structures, neurological examination (including fundoscopy)

### Referral and Further Assessment
- **Emergency Admission/Urgent Referral**:
  - Required if red flags or serious secondary causes are suspected.
  
- **Further Assessment in Primary Care**:
  - Consider headache diary for at least 8 weeks if:
    - Primary diagnosis is uncertain but secondary cause has been excluded.
    - Generally, investigations are unnecessary for diagnosing primary headaches.
