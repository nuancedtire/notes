## Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Summary

### Definition
- PID is an infection of the upper genital tract, primarily affecting sexually active young women.
- It spreads from the vagina and endocervix, potentially causing:
  - Endometritis
  - Salpingitis
  - Parametritis
  - Oophoritis
  - Tubo-ovarian abscess
  - Pelvic peritonitis (in severe cases)

### Trends
- Incidence of PID may be decreasing, especially among age groups eligible for chlamydia screening.

### Causes
- Commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs):
  - **Chlamydia trachomatis**
  - **Neisseria gonorrhoeae**
  - **Mycoplasma genitalium**
- Mixed infections with normal vaginal microbiome and other pathogens may also occur.

### Risk Factors
1. **Sexual Behavior:**
   - Age < 25 years
   - Lack of barrier contraception
   - Previous PID or STI
   - Multiple or recent new sexual partners
2. **Medical Procedures:**
   - Recent uterine instrumentation
   - Interruption of cervical barrier

### Complications
- Increased risk with severe/repeated infection, non-infective complications include:
  - Ectopic pregnancy
  - Tubal factor infertility
  - Chronic pelvic pain

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Assessment:**
  - Symptoms: recent pelvic/lower abdominal pain, deep dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, abnormal vaginal bleeding, mucopurulent discharge, systemic symptoms
  - Contraception history, pregnancy risk, sexual history, risk factors for PID, smear history
- **Examination:**
  - General, abdominal, and pelvic examination for tenderness
- **Investigations:**
  - Pregnancy test
  - Vaginal swabs for STI testing
  - Blood tests (inflammatory markers, HIV, syphilis serology)

### Initial Management
1. **Urgent Hospital Admission:**
   - If pregnant, suspected ectopic pregnancy, severe complications, systemic illness, or if primary care management is not feasible.
2. **Referral:**
   - To local specialist sexual health service for STI screening, treatment, and partner tracing.
3. **Symptom Relief:**
   - Advise on over-the-counter medications.
4. **Antibiotic Treatment:**
   - Empirical antibiotics as soon as PID is suspected, potentially before test results.
5. **Abstinence:**
   - Advise abstaining from sexual activity until both the woman and partners are treated, symptom-free, and have a 'test of cure' if needed.
6. **Information and Support:**
   - Provide sources for further information and support.
7. **Follow-Up:**
   - Review within 72 hours to assess treatment response, review results, adjust treatment as necessary, and discuss contraception to reduce reinfection risk.
8. **Partner Treatment:**
   - Ensure screening and treatment for sexual partners.
