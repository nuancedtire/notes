## Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Summary

### Overview
- PCOS is a heterogeneous endocrine disorder that typically emerges at puberty.
- Characterized by:
  - **Hyperandrogenism**: Clinical features include acne and hirsutism.
  - **Ovulation disorder**: Often manifests as infrequent or absent menstruation.
  - **Polycystic ovarian morphology**: Detected via ultrasound.
- One of the most common endocrine disorders in women of reproductive age.

### Etiology
- The cause of PCOS is unknown; likely multifactorial with genetic and environmental factors.

### Complications
- **Infertility**
- **Cardiovascular disease (CVD)**
- **Metabolic disorders**: Impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes.
- **Obstructive sleep apnea**
- **Psychological disorders**: Anxiety, depression.
- **Pregnancy complications**: Pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes.
- **Endometrial cancer**
- **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease**

### Diagnosis
- Calculate the **free androgen index** to assess active testosterone.
- Measure levels of:
  - Luteinizing hormone (LH)
  - Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
  - Prolactin
  - Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
- **Ultrasound referral** for adult women (unless diagnosis is clear through clinical/biochemical assessment).
- **Do not use ultrasound** for diagnosing adolescents due to high incidence of multi-follicular ovaries.
- **Polycystic ovaries** on ultrasound: 20 or more follicles in at least one ovary.

### Diagnostic Criteria
- In adults, PCOS diagnosis requires **two of the following** (after excluding other causes):
  - Clinical/biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism
  - Ovulatory dysfunction
  - Polycystic ovarian morphology on ultrasound
- In adolescents, stricter criteria are recommended:
  - Both hyperandrogenism and irregular menstrual cycles are needed to account for normal pubertal changes.

### Management
- **Clinical feature management**
- **Screening for cardiovascular risk factors** and lifestyle advice to reduce CVD risk.
- **Weight loss** should be advised when appropriate.
- **Assess and manage** other potential complications of PCOS.
- Provide **additional information and support** resources.
- Adolescents with PCOS features but not meeting diagnostic criteria are at **increased risk** and should be reassessed before full reproductive maturity (8 years post-menarche). This includes:
  - Those with PCOS features before starting combined oral contraceptives.
  - Those with persistent features and significant weight gain during adolescence.
