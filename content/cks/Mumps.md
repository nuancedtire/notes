## Mumps: Summary

### Overview
- **Cause**: Acute infectious disease caused by paramyxovirus.
- **Symptoms**: Characterized by bilateral parotid swelling.
- **Transmission**: Spread via respiratory droplets, fomites, or saliva.
- **Incubation Period**: 14-18 days (range 12–25 days).
- **Infectious Period**: Most infectious 1–2 days before symptoms to about 9 days after.

### Asymptomatic Cases
- Occurs in 15–20% of individuals, common in children.

### Immunity
- Nearly all individuals develop life-long immunity after one episode.
- 1–2% of cases may be re-infections.

### Clinical Presentation
- **Parotitis**: Present in 95% of symptomatic cases.
- **Non-specific Symptoms**: Fever, headache, malaise, muscle ache, loss of appetite.
- **Epididymo-orchitis**: 
  - Affects ~25% of post-pubertal men.
  - Unilateral may transiently reduce sperm parameters.
  - Bilateral affects 15–30% and can cause infertility in 30–87%.
- **Oophoritis**: Occurs in ~5% of post-pubertal women, rarely causes infertility.

### Complications
- **Common**: Aseptic meningitis, transient hearing loss, pancreatitis.
- **Rarer**: CNS disorders (cerebellar ataxia, facial palsy, transverse myelitis, Guillain–Barre syndrome), thyroiditis, mastitis, prostatitis, hepatitis, thrombocytopenia.

### Reporting
- Mumps is a notifiable disease. Notify local Health Protection Team if suspected.

### Management Advice
- Mumps is usually self-limiting, resolves in 1–2 weeks with no long-term consequences.
- Recommendations:
  - Rest and hydrate adequately.
  - Use paracetamol or ibuprofen for symptomatic relief (avoid aspirin in children <16).
  - Apply warm or cold packs to the parotid gland for discomfort.
  - Stay off school/work for 5 days post-parotitis onset.

### When to Seek Further Help
- Signs of mumps encephalitis (altered consciousness, focal neurological signs, seizures).
- Development of mumps meningitis (severe headache, neck ache, high fever, lethargy, vomiting).
- Abnormal semen analysis or infertility following epididymo-orchitis, especially bilateral cases.

### Immunization
- Offer combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine to contacts not fully immunized, except for pregnant or severely immunocompromised individuals.
