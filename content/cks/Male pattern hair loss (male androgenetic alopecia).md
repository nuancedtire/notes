### Male Pattern Hair Loss (Male Androgenetic Alopecia) Summary

- **Definition**: Genetically determined, patterned, progressive hair loss from the scalp.
- **Progression**:
  - Initial loss at the front and sides of the scalp.
  - Progresses towards the back of the head.
  
- **Pathogenesis**:
  - Involves androgens and genetics.
  - Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) binds to androgen receptors in susceptible hair follicles.
  - Activates genes that shorten the anagen (hair growth) phase.
  - Transforms large terminal hair follicles into miniaturized follicles.
  - Results in shorter, finer, non-pigmented vellus hairs replacing thicker, pigmented terminal hairs.

- **Age of Onset**:
  - Usually between 20â€“25 years.
  - Prevalence increases with age:
    - 30% affected by age 30
    - 50% by age 50
    - 80% by age 70

- **Complications**:
  - Adverse psychosocial effects (impaired self-esteem, feelings of isolation).
  - Scalp damage (loss of protection against UV light, cold, mechanical injury).

- **Progression**: 
  - Unpredictable rate of progression in untreated men.
  - Some may lose almost all scalp hairs; others retain significant amounts, especially in occipital and parietal areas.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Supported by careful history and physical examination.
  - Suspect alternative diagnoses if:
    - Profound shedding or rapid onset of hair loss.
    - Temporal hair thinning.
    - Inflammation, papules, pustules, scaling, or scarring on scalp.
    - Absent/reduced eyebrows or eyelashes.
    - History of systemic diseases (e.g., severe infection, iron deficiency, hypothyroidism).
    - Medication changes.
    - Dietary habit changes.

- **Laboratory Testing**:
  - Generally unnecessary but consider tests for:
    - Thyroid function
    - Full blood count
    - Ferritin and vitamin D levels
  - Particularly if:
    - An underlying cause or alternative diagnosis is suspected.
    - Presentation is atypical.
    - Symptoms of hypothyroidism, anemia, or vitamin D deficiency are present.

- **Management Options**:
  - **No treatment**: For mild pattern hair loss.
  - **Drug treatment**:
    - Topical minoxidil
    - Oral finasteride (1 mg)
  - **Aesthetic options**:
    - Hairpieces and wigs
    - Hair styling and coloring
  - **Surgical treatment**: Hair transplantation.

- **Referral to Specialist**: Consider if:
  - Atypical presentation, extensive hair loss, or uncertain diagnosis.
  - Possible underlying condition needing secondary care.
  - No response to primary care treatments.
  - Adverse psychosocial effects present.
