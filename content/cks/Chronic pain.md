## Chronic Pain Summary

### Definition
- **Chronic Pain**: 
  - Unpleasant sensory and emotional experience related to actual or potential tissue damage.
  - Persists or recurs for more than 3 months.
  - Multifactorial: influenced by biological, psychological, and social factors.

### Types of Chronic Pain
- **Chronic Primary Pain**: 
  - Pain in one or more anatomical regions causing significant emotional distress or functional disability.
  - Diagnosis is independent of biological or psychological factors unless a better diagnosis is available.

### Common Types of Pain
1. Back pain (53%)
2. Headache (48%)
3. Joint pain (46%)

### Causes of Chronic Pain
- Acute injury
- Ongoing degenerative illness
- Chronic systemic conditions
- Localized or regional disease
- Surgery or medical interventions

### Symptoms Duration
- Symptoms usually last several months to years.

### Treatment Options
- **Analgesics**: Effective for a small percentage of individuals.
- **Non-pharmacological treatments**: Can reduce symptoms and disability, complementing analgesic use.

### Prognostic Factors for Poor Outcome
- Higher pain severity and disability
- Longer pain duration
- Multiple pain sites
- History of anxiety and depression
- Maladaptive coping strategies (e.g., worry, avoidance)
- Low social support at diagnosis

### Complications of Chronic Pain
- Disability
- Psychological distress
- Medicine misuse
- Sleep impairment
- Adverse effects from medications (e.g., NSAIDs, opioids)
- Reduced quality of life

### Assessment and Management
- Conduct a **biopsychosocial assessment**.
- Discuss a care and support plan considering individual priorities, strengths, preferences, interests, and abilities.
- Management for known pain causes should follow appropriate guidelines.

### Recommendations for Management
- All individuals with chronic primary pain should be:
  - Offered a supervised group exercise program.
  - Encouraged to remain physically active for long-term health benefits.
  - Provided self-management advice.

### Consideration of Treatment Options
- Effective options include:
  - Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
  - Acupuncture or dry needling
  - Antidepressants

### Medications to Avoid
- Antiepileptic drugs (e.g., gabapentinoids)
- Antipsychotics
- Benzodiazepines
- Corticosteroid trigger point injections
- Ketamine
- Local anesthetics (unless in clinical trials for complex regional pain syndrome)
- Local anesthetic/corticosteroid combination trigger point injections
- NSAIDs
- Opioids
- Paracetamol

### Specialist Referral
Arrange referrals if:
- Red flag signs/symptoms indicating serious pathology are present.
- Non-specialist management is ineffective.
- Chronic pain is poorly controlled.
- Significant distress is evident.
- Specific specialist intervention or assessment is needed.
- Chronic regional pain syndrome is suspected.
