## Retinal Detachment: Quick Revision

### Definition
- **Retinal Detachment**: Separation of the inner neurosensory retina from the retinal pigment epithelium, leading to accumulation of vitreous fluid in the subretinal space, resulting in progressive vision loss.

### Types of Retinal Detachment
1. **Rhegmatogenous Detachment**:
   - Most common form.
   - Caused by vitreous shrinkage and separation, leading to retinal tears and fluid entry into the subretinal space.

2. **Exudative Detachment**:
   - Caused by fluid leakage into the subretinal space, often due to inflammation or malignancy.

3. **Tractional Detachment**:
   - Common in proliferative diabetic retinopathy, where abnormal vasculature causes vitreous contraction, pulling on the retina.

### Epidemiology
- Common eye emergency in the UK: annual incidence of 10-15 per 100,000 people.
- Men more frequently present with trauma-related retinal detachment.

### Risk Factors
- Myopia
- Family history of retinal breaks or detachment
- Eye trauma
- Cataract surgery
- Proliferative diabetic retinopathy

### Consequences
- Untreated symptomatic retinal detachment leads to permanent vision loss.
- Early recognition and referral can facilitate surgical repair and decrease the risk of visual impairment.

### Symptoms to Suspect Retinal Detachment
- New onset of floaters
- New onset of flashes
- Sudden-onset painless visual field loss
- Progressive reduction in visual acuity, blurred or distorted vision

### Management
- **If retinal detachment is suspected**:
  - **Immediate Referral**: To an ophthalmologist with retinal surgery expertise for same-day evaluation if sight-threatening symptoms are present.
  - **Urgent Referral**: To a practitioner skilled in slit lamp examination and indirect ophthalmoscopy within 24 hours if no sight-threatening symptoms are present.
  - **Patient Education**: Provide information on driving safety, warning signs of future retinal issues, and eye protection during at-risk sports.
