## Halitosis Overview

- **Definition**: Halitosis (bad breath/oral malodour) refers to an unpleasant odour in the breath that exceeds socially acceptable levels.

### Types of Halitosis
1. **Physiological Halitosis**
   - Transient and normal.
   - Common causes: 
     - Morning breath
     - Fasting

2. **Non-pathological Halitosis**
   - Lifestyle-related.
   - Common causes:
     - Smoking
     - Odiferous foods (e.g., onion, garlic)
     - Alcohol

3. **Pathological Halitosis**
   - Usually intra-oral causes:
     - Tongue coating
     - Gingivitis
     - Periodontitis
     - Poor denture hygiene
   - Rarely extra-oral causes:
     - Nasal/paranasal/laryngeal conditions
     - Respiratory or gastrointestinal conditions
     - Metabolic disorders
     - Drugs

4. **Psychogenic Halitosis**
   - Subjective belief of having halitosis without objective confirmation (extreme form: halitophobia).

### Impact
- Halitosis is common and can negatively affect mood and quality of life.

### Assessment
- **Self-reported halitosis evaluation** should include:
  - Impact on behavior and mood
  - Severity, timing, and duration of symptoms
  - Lifestyle factors
  - Dental history and oral hygiene
  - Co-morbid conditions
  - Contributory drugs
  - Concerns from partner/friends/family
  - Smelling exhaled breath (mouth vs. nose)
  - Oral examination (teeth, tongue, oral cavity)

### Management
1. **Reassurance and Education**: Explain physiological halitosis.
2. **Information and Support**: Provide resources.
3. **Dental Appointment**: Schedule for full oral examination if needed.
4. **Lifestyle Changes**: Encourage appropriate modifications.
5. **Manage Underlying Causes**: Address in primary care.
6. **Oral Hygiene**: Emphasize importance of hygiene and regular dental visits.
7. **Re-assessment**: Objective evaluation if symptoms persist.
8. **Referral**: Send to specialist if halitosis is secondary to an unmanageable cause or persists despite self-management advice.
