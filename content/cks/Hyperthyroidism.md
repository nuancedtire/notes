## Hyperthyroidism: Quick Revision

### Definition
- **Hyperthyroidism**: Increased production and secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.
- **Thyrotoxicosis**: Clinical manifestation of excess circulating thyroid hormones, regardless of cause.

### Types
1. **Primary Hyperthyroidism**: Caused by thyroid gland abnormalities (e.g., Graves' disease, nodular goitre).
   - **Overt Primary Hyperthyroidism**: 
     - TSH suppressed below normal.
     - FT4 and/or FT3 above normal.
   - **Subclinical Hyperthyroidism**:
     - TSH suppressed below normal.
     - FT4 and FT3 within normal range.
2. **Thyrotoxicosis without Hyperthyroidism**: Thyrotoxicosis without thyroid overactivity, often transient (e.g., thyroiditis, excess levothyroxine).

### Complications
- Thyrotoxic crisis
- Graves' orbitopathy
- Compression symptoms (large goitre)
- [[Atrial fibrillation]]
- Heart failure

### Diagnosis
**Suspected Hyperthyroidism If:**
- **Symptoms**: Anxiety, palpitations, tremor, weight loss, diarrhoea, heat intolerance.
- **Signs**: Agitation, sinus tachycardia, goitre, thyroid nodules.
- **Graves' Orbitopathy Features**: Excessive eye watering, double vision, visual acuity changes, eyelid retraction, proptosis.

### Assessment Steps
1. **History**: Symptoms, recent illnesses, drug treatments, risk factors.
2. **Examination**: Signs of hyperthyroidism, goitre, Graves' orbitopathy.
3. **Lab Tests**:
   - Check serum TSH.
   - Measure FT4 and FT3 if TSH is suppressed.
   - Recheck TFTs in 3 months if subclinical hyperthyroidism is suspected.
   - Consider additional blood tests (inflammatory markers, thyroid autoantibodies) if indicated.

### Management
- **Emergency**: Admission if serious complications suspected.
- **Referrals**:
  - Urgent endocrinology for suspected pituitary/hypothalamic disorders.
  - Endocrinology for new-onset overt hyperthyroidism.
  - Referral for persistent subclinical hyperthyroidism (TSH < 0.1 mU/L).
- **Medications**: 
  - Beta-blockers for adrenergic symptoms.
  - Antithyroid drugs if clinically indicated.
- **Support**: Provide information and support resources.
- **Monitoring**: Follow specialist advice regarding adverse effects and blood monitoring.

### Management for Women of Childbearing Potential
- **Pre-pregnancy Counselling**: Referral for women with overt/subclinical hyperthyroidism planning pregnancy.
- **Medical Advice**: Seek immediately if pregnancy suspected/confirmed.
- **Urgent Referral**: For pregnant women with overt/subclinical hyperthyroidism.
- **Postpartum TFTs**: Check depending on specialist advice.
