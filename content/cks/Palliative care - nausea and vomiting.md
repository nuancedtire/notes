### Complications
- Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance
- Decreased nutrition
- Decreased quality of life

### Assessment
- Review history, examination, and investigations to identify causes and assess clinical state.
- Consider blood tests to exclude hypercalcaemia or renal failure.
- Decide whether to treat the cause or focus on symptom management, considering:
  - Stage of illness
  - Prognosis
  - Severity of symptoms
  - Wishes of the patient and family

### Management Strategies
#### Simple Measures
- Access to a large bowl, tissues, and water
- Small snacks instead of large meals
- Cool fizzy drinks instead of still or hot drinks
- Relaxation techniques
- Parenteral hydration, if appropriate
- Cognitive behavioural therapy for anticipatory nausea/vomiting

#### Anti-Emetic Management
- Manage underlying cause if possible.
- Choose anti-emetics based on the known cause.
- Administer:
  - Via the most appropriate route
  - Regularly and as required
  - Review every 24 hours
  - Continue unless symptoms resolve

### Follow-Up
- If first-line anti-emetic is ineffective:
  - Re-assess cause of nausea/vomiting
  - Optimize anti-emetic dose and/or reassess route
  - If symptoms persist after 2-3 doses, try a different anti-emetic or a combination with complementary actions.
- If symptoms persist after 24 hours, refer to a specialist palliative care team.
