- **DMARDs Overview**  
  - Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory drugs.
  - Designed to influence disease course.
  - Regular monitoring needed due to potential adverse effects.

- **Adverse Effects**  
  - Myelosuppression
  - Gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, and pulmonary toxicity
  - Increased risk of infection

- **Indications**  
  - Primary: Rheumatoid arthritis (monotherapy or combination therapy)
  - Others: Ankylosing spondylitis, connective tissue diseases, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease

- **Classification of DMARDs**  
  - **Conventional Synthetic DMARDs**: Methotrexate, sulfasalazine
  - **Biologic DMARDs**: Adalimumab, infliximab
  - **Targeted Synthetic DMARDs**: Apremilast, tofacitinib

- **Management Protocol**  
  - Initiation and initial monitoring by specialists in secondary care.
  - GPs may prescribe and monitor post-stabilization (shared care protocol).
  - Varying prescribing and monitoring requirements based on the specific DMARD.

- **Key Monitoring Parameters**  
  - Immediate specialist discussion required for:
    - White cell count < 3.5 x 10^9/L
    - Mean cell volume > 105 fL
    - Neutrophils < 1.6 x 10^9/L
    - Creatinine increase > 30% over 12 months or GFR < 60 mL/min
    - Unexplained eosinophilia > 0.5 x 10^9/L
    - ALT/AST > 100 U/L
    - Platelet count < 140 x 10^9/L
    - Unexplained albumin < 30 g/L
    - Urinary protein 2+ or more

- **Urgent Referral Criteria**  
  - Stop treatment and refer urgently to rheumatology for:
    - Skin/mucosal reactions (rash, pruritus, ulceration)
    - Sore throat, fever
    - Unexplained bruising/bleeding
    - Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss
    - Diffuse alopecia
    - Breathlessness, infection, cough
    - Peripheral neuropathy

- **Specific Biologic DMARD Concerns**  
  - Stop treatment and refer urgently for:
    - Cough, hemoptysis, weight loss (possible tuberculosis)
    - Signs of heart failure or worsening heart failure
    - Shortness of breath, dry cough (possible interstitial lung disease)
    - Skin rashes
    - Severe abdominal pain or unexplained bowel changes with fever
