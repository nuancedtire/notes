## [[Acute Pyelonephritis]] Summary

### Definition
- [[Acute pyelonephritis]]: Infection of one or both kidneys, typically caused by bacteria from the bladder.
- Most common pathogen: **Escherichia coli** (60-80% of uncomplicated infections).

### Complications
- Sepsis
- Renal parenchyma scarring
- Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs)
- Renal abscess formation
- Preterm labor in pregnancy
- Emphysematous pyelonephritis

### Diagnosis
- **History & Physical Examination:** 
  - Signs/symptoms of UTI: dysuria, frequency, urgency.
  - New signs/symptoms of pyelonephritis: fever, nausea, vomiting, flank pain.
- **Urine Tests:**
  - Midstream/catheter urine specimen for culture and sensitivity.
  - Urine dipstick test (not for indwelling catheter patients or those >65 years).
- **Final Diagnosis:** Confirm UTI via culture, exclude other causes of loin pain/fever.

### Treatment
- **Severe Symptoms:** Hospital admission.
- **Antibiotics for Non-Severe Cases:**
  - Women (not pregnant), men, indwelling catheter patients:
    - **Ciprofloxacin:** 500 mg twice a day for 7 days.
    - **Trimethoprim:** 200 mg twice a day for 14 days.
    - **Co-amoxiclav:** 500/125 mg three times a day for 7-10 days.
    - **Cefalexin:** 500 mg twice/three times a day (up to 1-1.5 g three/four times/day for severe infections) for 7-10 days.
  - Pregnant women (not requiring admission):
    - **Cefalexin:** 500 mg twice/three times a day (up to 1-1.5 g three/four times/day for severe infections) for 7-10 days.

### Follow-Up
- Review culture and sensitivity results; change antibiotic if resistant.
- Provide advice on:
  - Possible adverse effects (diarrhea, nausea).
  - When to seek medical help (worsening symptoms, no improvement in 48 hours).
  - Pain management (paracetamol, weak opioid if needed).
  - Importance of hydration.

### Reassessment
- If symptoms worsen or do not improve within 48 hours, reassess the patient.

### Referral Considerations
- Significant dehydration or inability to take oral fluids/medications.
- Pregnant patients.
- Higher risk for complications (structural/function abnormalities, diabetes, immunosuppression).
- Recurrent UTI (two or more episodes in 6 months).
- Men with a single episode without an obvious cause.
- All recurrent pyelonephritis cases.
- Urgent referral for suspected urological cancer.
