## Hepatitis C Summary

- **Definition**: Hepatitis C infection is a slow, progressive liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It is a significant, underdiagnosed, and undertreated cause of morbidity and mortality in the UK.

- **Infection Types**:
  - **Acute Infection**: Occurs within 6 months of acquiring HCV.
  - **Chronic Infection**: Follows acute infection in 55â€“85% of cases and lasts 6 months or more.

- **Transmission**:
  - **Primary Routes**: Contact with infected blood (e.g., sharing needles, blood transfusion pre-1990, inadequate sterilization of medical equipment, needlestick injuries).
  - **Less Common Routes**: Sexual transmission, vertical transmission (mother to baby).

- **Complications**:
  - Cirrhosis
  - Liver failure
  - Hepatocellular carcinoma

- **Testing**:
  - **Offer/Consider Testing If**:
    - Risk factors for hepatitis C
    - Clinical features (fatigue, arthralgia, jaundice)
    - Abnormal liver function tests
  - **Diagnosis**:
    - **Antibody Test**: Indicates if a person has ever been infected.
    - **HCV RNA Test**: Confirms active infection and allows genotype analysis.

- **Action Steps**:
  - For suspected acute infection: Seek same-day assessment or immediate specialist advice.
  - For suspected chronic infection: Arrange urgent referral to a specialist.

- **Notification**: Local Health Protection Team should be informed about suspected acute viral hepatitis cases.

- **Primary Care Management**:
  - Ensure attendance at specialist appointments.
  - Provide information and support.
  - Advise on reducing disease progression risks (e.g., reduce alcohol, stop smoking).
  - Prevent infection spread: Avoid sharing razors, toothbrushes, toiletries.
  - Highlight sexual transmission risks (greater in multiple partners, co-infection with HIV, risky practices).
  - Encourage informing contacts for testing.
  - Monitor for adverse effects of specialist drug treatment (e.g., hypoglycaemia).
  - Offer immunization against hepatitis A and B for those at continued risk.
