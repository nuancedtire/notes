## Anaemia - Iron Deficiency: Summary

### Definition
- **Anaemia**: Hb level two standard deviations below normal for age and sex.
- **Iron Deficiency Anaemia**: Diminished red blood cell production due to low iron stores.

### Hb Levels by Group
- **Men (>15 years)**: Hb < 130 g/L
- **Non-pregnant Women (>15 years)**: Hb < 120 g/L
- **Children (12–14 years)**: Hb < 120 g/L
- **Pregnant Women**: 
  - Throughout pregnancy: Hb < 110 g/L
  - 1st Trimester: Hb ≥ 110 g/L
  - 2nd & 3rd Trimester: Hb ≥ 105 g/L
- **Postpartum**: Hb < 100 g/L

### Causes
- Multifactorial: 
  - Dietary deficiency
  - Malabsorption
  - Increased loss
  - Increased requirements

### Symptoms
- Common: Fatigue, dyspnoea, headache
- Common Signs: Pallor, atrophic glossitis
- Less Common Signs: Tachycardia, nail changes, angular cheilosis
- Note: Absence of signs possible even with severe anaemia.

### Diagnosis
- **Serum Ferritin**: 
  - < 30 micrograms/L confirms iron deficiency.
  - Interpretation can be difficult if:
    - Infection/inflammation present (may show high levels)
    - Pregnancy (less reliable)

### Referral Guidelines
- **Urgent Referral**:
  - >60 years with iron deficiency anaemia
  - Women >55 years with postmenopausal bleeding
  - Faecal immunochemical testing result ≥ 10 micrograms of Hb/g faeces
  - <50 years with rectal bleeding (consider urgent referral)
  
- **Consider Diagnostic Trial of Iron Treatment**:
  - Premenopausal women with menorrhagia
  - Pregnant women (if no suspicion of coeliac disease)
  
- **Do Not Use Diagnostic Trial of Iron Treatment**:
  - Men and postmenopausal women (exclude GI bleeding sources).

### Treatment
- **Iron Supplementation**: 
  - One tablet daily of oral ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, or ferrous gluconate.
  - Continue for 3 months after correction of deficiency.
  
- **Monitoring**:
  - Check Hb levels (full blood count) after 2–4 weeks.
  - Specialist assessment if increase in Hb < 20 g/L after treatment.
