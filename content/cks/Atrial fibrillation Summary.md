## [[Atrial Fibrillation]] (AF) Summary

### Definition
- AF is a supraventricular tachyarrhythmia characterized by uncoordinated atrial electrical activation and ineffective atrial contraction, resulting in an irregular and often rapid ventricular rhythm.

### Classification
1. **Paroxysmal**: Episodes terminate within 7 days.
2. **Persistent**: Lasts longer than 7 days.
3. **Longstanding Persistent**: Duration of at least 12 months.
4. **Permanent**: No further attempts to restore or maintain sinus rhythm.

### Risk Factors
- Hypertension
- Ischaemic heart disease
- Heart failure
- Valvular heart disease
- Intercurrent illness
- Electrolyte disturbances
- Thyrotoxicosis
- Lifestyle factors (e.g., alcohol excess)

### Symptoms and Complications
- Often asymptomatic and undiagnosed.
- Possible complications include:
  - Stroke
  - Heart failure
  - Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy
  - Increased all-cause mortality

### Diagnosis
**Suspicion of AF** in individuals with:
- Irregular pulse (with or without symptoms such as breathlessness, palpitations, [[chest pain]], dizziness, syncope).
- Presence of risk factors or complications.
- Device notification of irregular pulse.

**Assessment includes**:
- Inquiry about symptoms (onset, nature, duration, severity) and comorbidities.
- Pulse check and heart auscultation (rate, rhythm, murmurs).
- Lung auscultation for heart failure signs.
- Arranging a 12-lead ECG for confirmation.
- Consideration of further tests (blood tests, chest X-ray, echocardiogram, ambulatory ECG).

### Management
**Acute Management**:
- Emergency hospital admission for severe symptoms or instability.
- Urgent referral for new-onset AF within 48 hours with structural heart disease.
- Assess stroke and bleeding risks; manage modifiable bleeding risk factors.
- Consider anticoagulation (first-line: direct-acting oral anticoagulant - DOAC).
- Rate-control drug treatment based on symptoms and comorbidities.
- Regular review and monitoring of treatments and symptoms.
- Provide information and support resources.
- Prompt cardiology referral if needed for rhythm-control treatments.

### Routine Review
- Management of complications and underlying causes.
- Reassess stroke and bleeding risks.
- Monitor and optimize drug treatments.
- Refer to cardiology for recurrent symptoms despite treatment.
