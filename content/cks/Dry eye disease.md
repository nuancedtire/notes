## Dry Eye Disease: Quick Revision

### Definition
- Multifactorial disease of the ocular surface
- Characterized by loss of tear film homeostasis
- Symptoms: ocular discomfort, visual symptoms

### Types
1. **Evaporative Dry Eye (more common)**
   - Increased tear film evaporation
   - Often due to deficient lipid layer
2. **Aqueous Deficient Dry Eye**
   - Reduced aqueous secretion from lacrimal glands
   - Causes reduced tear volume

### Causes
- Meibomian gland dysfunction
- Blepharitis
- Age-related changes
- Lid aperture disorders
- Sjögren’s syndrome (primary/secondary)
- Rosacea
- Reduced blink interval
- Environmental factors
- Iatrogenic causes (e.g., contact lens use, long-term topical eye preparation, systemic medications, post-eye surgery/radiation)

### Characteristics
- Usually chronic with fluctuating severity
- Variable duration based on underlying cause

### Complications
- Impact on daily activities (driving, reading, sleep)
- Psychological effects (anxiety, depression)
- Severe complications: corneal scarring, ulceration, infection, perforation, rare visual loss

### Diagnosis
- **Symptoms to suspect dry eye:**
  - Eye irritation, itching, discomfort
  - Eye dryness
  - Transient blurring of vision
  - Watery eyes
- **Signs:**
  - Mild conjunctival redness
  - Mucous discharge

### Assessment
- Symptom onset, severity, duration, fluctuation
- Impact on quality of life
- Red flags and underlying causes
- Ocular history, current medications, previous treatments
- Examination for:
  - Visual acuity
  - Red flag signs
  - Typical signs of dry eye
  - Abnormal lid anatomy/function
  - Eyelid inflammation or deposits
  - Cranial nerves and skin for underlying conditions

### Management
- Advise on information/support sources
- Lifestyle measures:
  - Warm compresses, lid hygiene, lid massage
  - Modify contact lens use
  - Avoid prolonged digital device use, air conditioning/drafts
- Reduce/stop contributory drug treatment if possible
- Optimize management of associated conditions
- Use of tear substitutes; arrange review if needed

### Specialist Referral
Refer if:
- Red flag symptoms/signs suggesting serious causes (same-day ophthalmology assessment)
- Serious underlying cause/complication suspected (urgent referral)
- Uncertain diagnosis
- Suspected underlying systemic condition (e.g., Sjögren’s syndrome)
- Abnormal lid anatomy/function
- Persistent/severe symptoms unresponsive to primary care after 4-12 weeks
