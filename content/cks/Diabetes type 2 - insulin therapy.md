- **Insulin Overview**  
  - Polypeptide hormone secreted by pancreatic beta cells.
  - Lowers blood glucose to prevent hyperglycemia and complications.
  
- **Type 2 Diabetes Context**  
  - Characterized by increased insulin resistance and progressive loss of beta cell function.
  - Some individuals require insulin therapy due to insufficient endogenous insulin for blood glucose control.

- **Types of Insulin in the UK**  
  - **Human Insulins**  
  - **Human Insulin Analogues**  
  - **Animal Insulins** (rarely used)  

- **Insulin Categories by Time-Action Profiles**  
  - **Short-acting Insulins**  
    - Mimic physiological insulin secretion in response to glucose intake.  
  - **Intermediate- and Long-acting Insulins**  
    - Mimic continuous basal insulin secretion throughout the day.  

- **Individualized Insulin Treatment Regimens**  
  - One, two, or three insulin injections per day.  
  - Multiple daily injection basal-bolus regimens.  

- **Adverse Effects of Insulin Therapy**  
  - **Hypoglycemia** (blood glucose < 3.5 mmol/L)  
    - **Mild Symptoms**: Hunger, anxiety, irritability, palpitations, sweating, tingling lips.  
    - **Moderate Symptoms**: Headache, drowsiness, concentration difficulties, impaired vision, confusion, irritability, agitation, behavioral changes.  
    - **Severe Symptoms**: Convulsions, loss of consciousness, coma (requires assistance for management).  

- **Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycemia**  
  - Loss of ability to recognize symptoms or absence of typical symptoms.

- **Education for Insulin Users Regarding Hypoglycemia**  
  - Emergency management of acute hypoglycemic episodes.  
  - Identification/review of hypoglycemia causes, including impaired awareness.  
  - Training for the individual and family/carers on recognition and management of episodes.  
  - Review of blood glucose control and treatment regimen adjustments.  
  - Advice on reducing the risk of future hypoglycemic episodes.  

- **Healthcare Professional Roles**  
  - Insulin treatment initiation, titration, and monitoring by trained professionals.  
  - Primary healthcare professionals can support with:  
    - Insulin administration, storage, injection technique, and site problems.  
    - Blood glucose self-monitoring.  
    - Lifestyle factors: diet, exercise, driving, alcohol, holidays, travel, insurance, fasting, and work.  
    - Management during intercurrent illness.
