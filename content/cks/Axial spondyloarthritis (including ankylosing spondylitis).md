- **Definition:**
  - Axial spondyloarthritis includes a group of chronic inflammatory rheumatologic conditions that cause musculoskeletal and extra-musculoskeletal manifestations.

- **Types:**
  - **Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis:**
    - Characterized by sacroiliitis and structural changes visible on X-ray (ankylosing spondylitis).
  - **Non-radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis:**
    - No X-ray changes, but possible sacroiliitis detectable via MRI.

- **Extra-musculoskeletal Manifestations:**
  - Acute anterior uveitis
  - Inflammatory bowel disease
  - Psoriasis

- **Pathophysiology:**
  - Complex factors include:
    - Genetics (e.g., HLA-B27)
    - Mechanical stress
    - Infection
    - Gut microbiome disruption

- **Possible Complications:**
  - Limited spinal mobility and deformity
  - Osteoporosis and spinal fractures
  - Increased cardiovascular risk
  - Irreversible structural damage due to sustained disease activity

- **Diagnosis:**
  - Suspected if:
    - Low back pain and spinal stiffness before age 45, lasting >3 months.
    - Plus four or more additional criteria:
      - Symptoms before age 35
      - Night pain
      - Buttock pain
      - Improvement with movement (not rest)
      - Improvement within 48 hours of NSAIDs
      - Family history
      - Current/past peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, psoriasis
    - Or three additional criteria with a positive HLA-B27 test
    - Or suspected dactylitis

- **Assessment:**
  - **History:**
    - Symptom characteristics, onset, severity, daily impact, complications, comorbidities, risk factors, treatments, and symptom response.
  - **Examination:**
    - Signs of inflammatory arthritis, limited spinal movement, enthesitis, dactylitis, psoriasis.
  - **Investigations:**
    - Blood tests for inflammatory markers and HLA-B27.
    - Plain X-ray of sacroiliac joints.

- **Initial Management:**
  - Trial of NSAID (maximum tolerated dose for 2â€“4 weeks). Switch if inadequate pain relief.

- **Management of Confirmed Axial Spondyloarthritis:**
  - Provide information and support.
  - Self-care advice (exercise, stretching, joint protection), pain/fatigue management, medication adjustments during flares, daily functioning management.
  - Check compliance and optimize drug treatments.
  - Assess symptom control and treatment response.
  - Arrange referrals (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, orthotics, podiatry) as needed.
  - Re-refer to rheumatology for uncontrolled symptoms or persistent flares.
  - Assess and manage cardiovascular and osteoporosis risk.
  - Urgent (same-day) ophthalmology referral for suspected acute anterior uveitis.
  - Referral to spinal surgery if clinically indicated.
