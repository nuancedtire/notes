### Cardiac Arrest - Out of Hospital Care: Summary

- **Definition**: Sudden circulatory failure due to loss of cardiac systolic function.
- **Statistics**: 
  - ~60,000 suspected cases annually.
  - Survival rate: <1 in 10 for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
  
- **Survival Factors**:
  - Immediate CPR can double or quadruple survival chances.
  - Defibrillation within 3-5 minutes can yield survival rates of 50-70%.

- **Signs of Cardiac Arrest**:
  - Suspect if a person is unresponsive and not breathing normally.

- **Initial Steps**:
  1. **Safety Assessment**: Ensure the environment is safe before approaching.
  2. **Breathing Assessment**: 
     - Turn person onto their back.
     - Tilt head back and lift chin to open airway.
  
- **Calling for Help**:
  - If unresponsive and not breathing normally:
    - Call 999 for an ambulance.
    - Stay with the person and activate speakerphone for communication.
    - Send someone to fetch an automated external defibrillator (AED), if available.

- **CPR Initiation**:
  - If no AED available, start CPR immediately.
  - **Compression to Breath Ratio**: 30:2.
  - **Compression Rate**: 100-120 compressions per minute.
  
- **Using a Defibrillator**:
  - Apply self-adhesive patches as soon as available.
  - Assess rhythm:
    - If VF or VT detected, administer one shock of 150 J.
    - Resume CPR for 2 minutes, then check rhythm.
    - If VF/VT persists, repeat shock and CPR sequence.

- **Medications**:
  - After third shock, give:
    - 1 mg IV Adrenaline.
    - 300 mg IV Amiodarone.
  - Repeat sequence and administer further adrenaline every 3-5 minutes.

- **Post-Resuscitation Care**:
  - Check for signs of Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC).
  - If ROSC is present, begin post-resuscitation care.
  
- **If Asystole/Pulseless Electrical Activity**:
  - No defibrillation. 
  - Continue CPR and administer 1 mg IV Adrenaline as soon as possible.
  
- **Ongoing CPR**:
  - Check for signs of life every 2 minutes.
  - Continue CPR until airway is secured.
  
- **Using an AED**:
  - Follow spoken and visual instructions provided by the device.
