## GORD in Children: Summary

### Definition
- **Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR)**: Passage of gastric contents into the oesophagus; normal in infants without troublesome symptoms.
- **Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)**: Presence of troublesome symptoms or complications due to GOR.

### Risk Factors
- Premature birth
- Parental history of heartburn or acid regurgitation
- Obesity
- Hiatus hernia
- History of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (repaired) or congenital oesophageal atresia (repaired)
- Neurodisability (e.g., cerebral palsy)

### Regurgitation
- Defined as movement of stomach contents up the oesophagus, potentially emerging from the mouth.
- Normal in infants under 1 year; in older children, may indicate GOR or GORD.
- Typically begins before 8 weeks; resolves in 90% of infants by 1 year.

### Symptoms Indicating GORD
#### In Infants:
- Distressed behavior (excessive crying, unusual neck postures)
- Hoarseness or chronic cough
- Single episode of pneumonia
- Unexplained feeding difficulties
- Faltering growth

#### In Children Over 1 Year:
- Heartburn
- Retrosternal pain
- Epigastric pain

### Emergency Situations
- **Same-day admission** if the child has:
  - Haematemesis (not from nosebleed or cracked maternal nipple)
  - Melaena
  - Dysphagia

### Specialist Assessment
Arrange if:
- Uncertain diagnosis or 'red flag' symptoms suggest a serious condition
- Persistent faltering growth with regurgitation
- Suspected complications (e.g., recurrent aspiration pneumonia, unexplained apnoeas)

### Management
#### For Frequent Regurgitation Only:
- Reassurance that symptoms likely improve over time.

#### For Breastfed Infants with Suspected GORD:
- 1-2 week trial of Gaviscon速 Infant.

#### For Formula-Fed Infants with Suspected GORD:
Sequential 1-2 week trial of:
1. Reduction of feed volume
2. More frequent feeds
3. Thickened feeds (e.g., Instant Carobel速)
4. Gaviscon速 Infant

#### Treatment Follow-Up:
- If Gaviscon速 Infant is successful, continue and reassess every 2 weeks.
- If unsuccessful, consider a 4-week trial of omeprazole or H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA).
- Persistent symptoms: refer for specialist assessment.

#### For Children Aged 1-2 Years with Suspected GORD:
- Consider a 4-week trial of omeprazole or H2RA.
- Persistent symptoms: refer for specialist assessment.
