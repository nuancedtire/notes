## Contraception - Natural Family Planning: Summary

### Definition
- Natural family planning (NFP) refers to methods for preventing or planning pregnancy based on the observation of fertility indicators during a woman's menstrual cycle.

### Methods of NFP
1. **Fertility Awareness Methods (FAM)**
   - Monitor fertility indicators to determine fertile and non-fertile periods:
     - **Basal Body Temperature**: A slight rise in temperature for 3 days indicates the end of the fertile period.
     - **Cervical Secretions**: Increased volume of clear, slippery secretions signals approaching ovulation.
     - **Cervical Changes**: Transition from low, firm cervix (closed) to high, soft cervix (open) indicates fertile window.
     - **Menstrual Cycle Length**: Calculate the cycle length to estimate ovulation and fertile days.

2. **Lactational Amenorrhoea Method (LAM)**
   - Utilizes breastfeeding to delay ovulation after childbirth:
     - Conditions for LAM:
       - Complete amenorrhoea.
       - Fully or nearly fully breastfeeding (baby receives 85%+ breast milk).
       - Less than 6 months postpartum.

### Considerations for Use
- **Assessment**: Evaluate the suitability of the method using the World Health Organization Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use.
- **Information**: Provide verbal and written details on method efficacy, advantages, and disadvantages.
- **Support**: Women should receive instruction from trained practitioners.
- **Alternative Contraceptives**: Discuss other options, such as long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), and compare efficacy.

### Special Circumstances
- **Health Risks**: NFP may not be suitable for women for whom pregnancy poses a significant health risk; alternative contraceptive methods should be discussed.
- **Teratogenic Drugs**: Women on teratogenic medications should not rely solely on fertility indicators for pregnancy prevention.
