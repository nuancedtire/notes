## Lipid Modification - CVD Prevention: Summary

### Overview
- **Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)**: Refers to various conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels.
- **Causes**: Blood clots (thrombosis) and [[atherosclerosis]] (fatty deposits in arteries).

### [[Atherosclerosis]]
- **Definition**: Build-up of plaques in arteries leading to hardening and narrowing.
- **Conditions Caused**:
  - Coronary heart disease ([[msra/Cardiovascular/Angina|angina]], myocardial infarction)
  - Stroke
  - Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
  - Peripheral arterial disease

### Lipid Profile Modification
- **Importance**: Modifying blood lipid profile can reduce CVD risk.
- **Key Measures**:
  - **Total cholesterol**: Important predictor of CVD events.
  - **Non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C)**: Difference between total and HDL-C; replaces LDL-C as primary target for risk reduction.
  - **Triglycerides**: Elevated levels are an independent risk factor for CVD.

### Primary Prevention
- **High-Intensity Statin Treatment (Atorvastatin 20 mg daily)** should be offered to:
  - Individuals aged 84 or younger with a â‰¥10% estimated 10-year CVD risk (QRISK3).
  - Individuals with type 1 diabetes aged >40 years or with longstanding diabetes (10+ years), nephropathy, or other risk factors.
  - Individuals with chronic kidney disease or familial hypercholesterolemia (no formal risk assessment needed).
  
- **Consideration** for individuals aged 85 or older with type 1 diabetes, balancing benefits, risks, and comorbidities.
- **Treatment Goal**: Achieve >40% reduction in non-HDL-C levels.

### Secondary Prevention
- **High-Intensity Statin Treatment (Atorvastatin 80 mg daily)** recommended for those with existing CVD:
  - History of myocardial infarction, [[msra/Cardiovascular/Angina|angina]], stroke, TIA, or peripheral arterial disease.
  
- **Decision Making**: Informed discussions about risks and benefits, considering co-morbidities, lifestyle interventions, and patient preferences.
- **Treatment Goal**: LDL-C <2.0 mmol/L or non-HDL-C <2.6 mmol/L.

### Baseline Tests Before Therapy
- Non-fasting lipid profile
- Liver function tests (transaminases)
- Renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate)
- HbA1c
- Creatine kinase (if muscle pain is present)
- Thyroid stimulating hormone (if symptomatic of thyroid issues)

### Management Strategies
- Address other modifiable CVD risk factors (e.g., smoking, obesity).
- Identify and manage secondary causes of dyslipidemia.
- Arrange follow-up for monitoring adverse effects and reviewing treatment.
