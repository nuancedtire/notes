## Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) Summary

### Characteristics
- Overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic organisms.
- Loss of lactobacilli.
- Increased vaginal pH (> 4.5) leading to loss of normal acidity.

### Risk Factors
#### Increased Risk
- Being sexually active (not an STI, but higher risk).
- Use of douches, deodorants, and vaginal washes.
- Alkaline vaginal pH factors (menstruation, semen).
- Copper intrauterine devices.
- Smoking.

#### Reduced Risk
- Use of hormonal contraception.
- Consistent condom use.
- Circumcised partner.

### Prevalence and Complications
- Most common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge in women of childbearing age.
- Also found in peri or postmenopausal women.
- Increased risk of acquiring STIs, including HIV.
- Associated with obstetric complications:
  - Late miscarriage
  - Pre-term labor
  - Pre-term birth
  - Pre-term premature rupture of membranes
  - Low birth weight
  - Postpartum endometritis
  - Increased risk of infections post-gynaecological procedures.

### Symptoms
- Approximately 50% are asymptomatic.
- Symptoms include fishy-smelling vaginal discharge.
- Not usually associated with soreness, itching, or irritation.
- Examination may reveal thin, white, homogeneous discharge.

### Diagnosis
- Tests involve checking vaginal discharge pH and/or Gram-stain and microscopy.
- Empirical treatment may be initiated if:
  - Low risk of STI.
  - No symptoms of other conditions.
  - No symptoms developed pre/post-gynaecological procedure.
  - Not postnatal or post-miscarriage.
  - Not pre/post-termination of pregnancy.
  - First episode or recurrent episode previously diagnosed as BV.
  - Not pregnant.

### Treatment
#### Non-pregnant Women
- Asymptomatic BV usually does not require treatment.
- Symptomatic treatment options:
  - **First choice**: Oral metronidazole.
  - Alternatives: Intravaginal metronidazole gel, intravaginal clindamycin cream.
  - Less preferred: Oral clindamycin, oral tinidazole.

#### Pregnant Women
- Routine screening for BV not recommended.
- If asymptomatic BV is found, consult obstetrician for treatment appropriateness.
- Symptomatic treatment options:
  - **First choice**: Oral metronidazole.
  - Alternatives: Intravaginal metronidazole gel, intravaginal clindamycin cream (not recommended in the first trimester).
  - Less preferred: Oral clindamycin.

### Patient Advice
- All women with BV should avoid exposure to contributing factors.
- Recurrence of BV is common; if symptoms persist or recur:
  - Check adherence to initial treatment.
  - Reconsider BV diagnosis.
  - Check for continued exposure to contributing factors.
  - Ensure adequate management of the current episode.
