## Urticaria Summary

- **Definition**: 
  - Urticaria is a superficial swelling of the skin resulting in a red, raised, itchy rash.
  - Angio-oedema is a deeper form with swelling in the dermis and subcutaneous tissues.

- **Classification by Duration**:
  - **Acute**: Symptoms last for less than 6 weeks.
  - **Chronic**: Symptoms persist for 6 weeks or longer, nearly daily.

- **Types of Chronic Urticaria**:
  - **Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria**: No identifiable external cause; may be aggravated by heat, stress, drugs, infections.
  - **Autoimmune Urticaria**: Presence of IgG autoantibodies to high-affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon R1).
  - **Chronic Inducible Urticaria (CINDU)**: Occurs in response to physical stimuli, further classified as:
    - Aquagenic
    - Cholinergic
    - Solar
    - Cold
    - Heat
    - Dermatographism
    - Delayed pressure
    - Vibratory
    - Contact urticaria

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Usually based on history and physical examination; investigations may be needed to identify triggers or exclude differential diagnoses.

- **Management**:
  - Identify and manage underlying causes when possible.
  - **Acute Urticaria**: Typically self-limiting; treatment with non-sedating antihistamines daily for up to 6 weeks if needed.
  - For severe symptoms: Short course of oral corticosteroids (up to 7 days).
  - If symptoms improve, consider long-term antihistamine treatment for 3-6 months or as needed.

- **Treatment Adjustments if Inadequate Response**:
  - Gradually increase the first-line antihistamine dose (up to four times the licensed dose).
  - Try an alternative non-sedating antihistamine.
  - Add topical antipruritic (e.g., calamine lotion).
  - Add sedating antihistamine at night if itch interferes with sleep.
  - Referral to a dermatologist or immunologist.

- **Referral Indications**:
  - Suspected vasculitic urticaria (painful and persistent).
  - Food or latex allergy, or difficult-to-manage CINDU.
  - Psychological impact on quality of life; referral to a clinical psychologist for significant social or psychological problems.
