## Glaucoma Summary

- **Definition**: Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases causing progressive optic neuropathy, often associated with raised intraocular pressure (IOP).

### Key Characteristics:
- Visual field defects.
- Changes to the optic nerve head (pathological cupping or pallor of the optic disc).

### Ocular Hypertension:
- Consistently or recurrently raised IOP without signs of glaucoma.
- Affects 3–5% of individuals in the UK over 40 years.
- Requires monitoring as it may progress to glaucoma.

### Classification of Glaucoma:
1. **Age of Onset**:
   - Congenital
   - Infantile
   - Juvenile
   - Adult
2. **Cause**:
   - Primary (unknown cause)
   - Secondary
3. **Rate of Onset**:
   - Acute
   - Subacute
   - Chronic
4. **Anterior Chamber Angle**:
   - Open
   - Closed

### Types of Glaucoma:
- **Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG)**:
  - Most common type, affecting about 2% of people in the UK over 40.
  - Insidious onset, chronic course.
  - Usually bilateral.
  - Associated with raised IOP but can occur with normal IOP.

- **Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG)**:
  - Affects about 0.4% of individuals in the UK over 40.
  - Many cases are asymptomatic chronic PACG.
  - Acute angle closure may present as a painful red eye and should be suspected in:
    - Females, Asians, long-sighted individuals, older adults.
    - History of blurred vision, headaches, eye pain with nausea, halos around lights (often in the evening).

### Symptoms of Acute Angle Closure:
- Headache, nausea, vomiting.
- Lights seen surrounded by halos (due to corneal edema).
- Semi-dilated and fixed pupil.
- Tender, hard eye.
- Impaired visual acuity.

### Management:
- If acute angle closure is suspected, immediate admission for ophthalmology assessment is required.
- If admission is not possible:
  - The patient should lie flat, face up, with the head not supported by pillows.
  - Administer pilocarpine drops (2% for blue eyes, 4% for brown eyes).
  - Acetazolamide 500 mg orally (if no contraindications).
  - Provide analgesia and anti-emetics as needed.

### Referral:
- If chronic glaucoma is suspected, refer to an optometrist or ophthalmologist.

### Complications:
- Main complication of untreated glaucoma: irreversible vision loss (partial or complete).
- Appropriate treatment reduces disease progression.

### Treatment:
- Treatment is usually initiated and monitored by specialists, focusing on reducing IOP to prevent visual loss.
- First line treatment for IOP of 24mmHg or more, PACG, and at risk of visual impairment: **360° selective laser trabeculoplasty**.
