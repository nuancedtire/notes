## Sprains and Strains: Quick Revision

### Definitions
- **Sprain**: Stretch and/or tear of a ligament; classified by severity. Commonly affects ankles, knees, wrists, and thumbs.
- **Strain**: Stretch and/or tear of muscle fibers and/or tendon; classified by severity. Commonly affects foot, hamstring, and back.

### Symptoms
- **Sprain Symptoms**:
  - Pain around the joint
  - Tenderness
  - Swelling
  - Bruising
  - Pain on weight-bearing
  - Decreased function
  - Possible joint instability (perception of 'giving way') after severe injury

- **Strain Symptoms**:
  - Muscle pain
  - Cramping
  - Spasm
  - Muscle weakness
  - Inflammation
  - Bruising

### Risk Factors
- Increased risk in individuals who frequently participate in sports.

### Complications (more common with severe injuries)
- **Sprain Complications**:
  - Chronic instability
  - Loss of function
  - Chronic pain and swelling
  - Risk of re-injury
  - Post-traumatic osteoarthritis

- **Strain Complications**:
  - Muscle atrophy
  - Muscle fibrosis
  - Compartment syndrome

### Prognosis
- Depends largely on the severity of the injury.

### Assessment
- **History Taking**:
  - Mechanism and timing of injury
  - Symptoms (severity and duration)
  - Usual physical activity level
  - Risk factors for injury or re-injury
  - Previous sprains, strains, or joint instability

- **Physical Examination**:
  - Signs of complications (limb deformity, asymmetry/misalignment)
  - Joint instability assessment
  - Weight-bearing capability and gait
  - Neurovascular examination

- **Imaging**:
  - Consider X-ray to assess injury extent or rule out fractures/dislocations.

### Management
- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Referral to emergency department for suspected fractures, dislocations, or serious complications.
  - Advise analgesia for symptom relief.
  - Recommend initial 'PRICE' (Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) self-management.
  - Discuss safe return to activities and sports, including re-injury risk factors.
  - Schedule medical review after 5-7 days based on clinical judgement.

- **Further Referrals**:
  - Physiotherapy for ongoing symptoms not improving as expected.
  - Orthopaedics referral if recovery is slower than expected, worsening/new symptoms, or symptoms disproportionate to injury mechanism.
