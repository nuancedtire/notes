- **Definition**: A malignant ulcer is a proliferative or cavitating primary or secondary cancer in the skin, presenting as a crater-like wound or nodular lesion.

- **Primary Care Management**:
  - **Assessment**:
    - Evaluate type, site, and size of ulcer.
    - Check for necrotic tissue and condition of surrounding skin.
    - Identify any complications.
  - **Patient Discussion**:
    - Address concerns and treatment priorities with the patient.
    - Advise that healing is unlikely; focus on maintaining quality of life.
  - **Professional Involvement**:
    - Involve wound management experts (e.g., district nurse, palliative care, tissue viability nurse) for advice on cleansing, debridement, and dressing selection.
  - **Referral**:
    - Refer to an oncologist or palliative care specialist for potential additional cancer treatments (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgical intervention).

- **Management of Common Complications**:
  - **Pain**:
    - Identify and treat underlying causes.
    - Use appropriate analgesia; provide breakthrough analgesia before dressing changes if needed.
  - **Infection**:
    - Take a swab; use antibiotics if indicated.
  - **Bleeding**:
    - Apply gentle pressure for mild bleeding; seek specialist advice for heavy bleeding.
  - **Exudate**:
    - Protect surrounding skin; consult specialists for copious exudate.
  - **Odour**:
    - Prescribe metronidazole as needed; consider non-pharmacological measures.
  - **Itch**:
    - Consider mild topical corticosteroids.
  - **Psychosocial Issues**:
    - Manage symptoms effectively; consider cosmetic impact of dressings.

- **Referral**: Consider referral for specialist advice if primary care management is insufficient.
