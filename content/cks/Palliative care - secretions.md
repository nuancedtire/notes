- **Airway Secretions in Terminal Illness**
  - Accumulation of secretions can lead to gurgling and rattling noises during breathing.
  - Noisy secretions may not cause distress to the patient but can be distressing for families and caregivers.

- **Concerns of Families and Caregivers**
  - Listen to relatives' concerns and fears.
  - Reassure them that a semiconscious or unconscious person is generally not distressed by the sounds.

- **Causes of Secretions at End of Life**
  - Salivary and bronchial secretions.
  - Chest infection.
  - Aspiration.
  - Gastric reflux.
  - Pulmonary oedema.
  - Bronchorrhoea (production of â‰¥ 100 mL/day of watery mucus).

- **Management of Noisy Respiratory Secretions**
  - Recognize signs of dying for appropriate care.
  - Reposition the patient on their side with upper body elevated to encourage postural drainage.
  
- **Medication Options**
  - If repositioning is ineffective, consider antimuscarinic drugs to reduce saliva production:
    - **Hyoscine hydrobromide**
    - **Hyoscine butylbromide**
    - **Glycopyrronium bromide**
  - Choose based on patient needs, drug properties, and availability.

- **When to Consider Antibiotics**
  - If secretions cause distress, and there's suspicion of infection or profuse purulent sputum due to a chest infection:
    - A single dose of broad-spectrum antibiotic may be considered.
    - Antibiotics may not alter the course significantly but can provide comfort by reducing thick, infected sputum.
