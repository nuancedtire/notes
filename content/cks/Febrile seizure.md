- **Definition**: 
  - Febrile seizure: seizure with fever (temp > 38Â°C) in infants/children (6 months - 5 years) without CNS infection.

- **Types**:
  - **Simple Febrile Seizures**:
    - Isolated, generalized, tonic-clonic.
    - Duration: < 15 minutes.
    - No recurrence within 24 hours or same febrile illness.
    - Complete recovery within 1 hour.
  
  - **Complex Febrile Seizures**:
    - Features: 
      - Partial (focal) seizure.
      - Duration: > 15 minutes.
      - Recurrence within 24 hours or same febrile illness.
      - Incomplete recovery within 1 hour.

- **Prevalence**: 
  - Most common childhood seizure type in children < 5 years.

- **Recurrence**: 
  - About one-third will have recurrent seizures after the first febrile seizure.

- **Assessment**:
  - Identify red flag symptoms (e.g., meningitis, encephalitis).
  - Determine underlying cause of fever.
  - Gather information on fever onset, peak temp, duration, and relationship to seizure.
  - Collect details on the seizure and post-ictal drowsiness.
  - Review previous seizure episodes and family history of seizures/epilepsy.
  - Assess child's temperature, consciousness, neurological status, fluid status, and signs of other causes.

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Parents/carers should:
    - Provide first aid.
    - Call emergency services or administer benzodiazepine if advised.
  
- **Hospital Assessment**:
  - Arrange for a paediatric assessment if:
    - First febrile seizure or no prior assessment.
    - Child < 18 months.
    - Complex febrile seizures.
    - Diagnostic uncertainty or unexplained fever without infection focus.
    - Focal neurological deficit, recent antibiotic use, or parental anxiety.
  
- **Referral**:
  - Refer to paediatrician/neurologist if:
    - Child has neurodevelopmental delay or signs of neurocutaneous/metabolic disorder.

- **Parental Advice**:
  - Reassure about benign nature of febrile seizures.
  - Provide information and support resources.
  - Educate on recognizing and managing future febrile seizures.
  - Discuss management of future febrile illnesses.
  - Note: Prophylactic antipyretics/antiepileptics not routinely prescribed unless specialist advised.
  - Ensure completion of all childhood immunizations.
