- **Staphylococcus aureus Overview**  
  - Colonizes skin, nose, or gut in up to a third of the population.  
  - Usually harmless on intact skin but can cause infections if it invades deeper tissues.  

- **Meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)**  
  - Strains of S. aureus resistant to multiple antibiotics.  

- **Healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA)**  
  - Strains found in individuals with healthcare service contact.  
  - Can present in hospitals or the community.  

- **Clinical Features of MRSA Infection**  
  - No specific features; can cause the same diseases as non-MRSA strains, including:  
    - Skin and soft tissue infections (boils, folliculitis, impetigo, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis)  
    - Urinary tract infections  
    - Pneumonia and bronchiectasis  
    - Joint and bone infections (osteomyelitis, septic arthritis)  
    - Sepsis and toxic shock syndrome  
    - [[Infective endocarditis]]  

- **When to Suspect MRSA**  
  - Risk factors present (recent hospitalization, previous MRSA infection/colonization, nursing home contact, antibiotic use, chronic illness, surgical wounds, open ulcers, IV lines, urinary catheters).  
  - No response to first-line antibiotics.  
  - Recurrent skin/soft tissue infections or chronic non-healing ulcers.  

- **Diagnosis**  
  - Based on clinical assessment and confirmatory lab results (swabs from lesions/wounds, urine, or sputum samples).  

- **Infection Control**  
  - Follow local policies for infection control measures for all cases (infected or colonized).  
  - Ensure careful communication among healthcare professionals.  

- **Referral to Secondary Care**  
  - Urgent assessment if suspected/confirmed MRSA with severe or complicated infection or if surgical intervention is needed.  

- **Treatment**  
  - For uncomplicated infections with suspected/confirmed MRSA:  
    - Discuss treatment (antibiotics, wound care) with a microbiologist or local infection-control team.  
    - Do not routinely use oral or topical antibiotics unless directed by microbiology.  
    - Follow up after 48 hours (or sooner if deterioration occurs) to monitor for complications and infection resolution.  

- **Decolonization**  
  - Not routinely required for asymptomatic community carriers.  
  - May be indicated if risk factors are present (wound, invasive device, or care home residency).
