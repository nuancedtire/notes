### Superficial Vein Thrombosis (Superficial Thrombophlebitis) Summary

- **Definition**: Superficial vein thrombosis involves thrombus formation in a superficial vein (commonly the saphenous vein) and associated inflammation in surrounding tissue.

- **Causes**:
  - **Idiopathic** or associated with risk factors:
    - **Common Risk Factors**: 
      - Varicose veins (most prevalent)
      - Thrombophilia
      - IV cannulation or drug administration
      - Pregnancy
      - Cancer
      - Previous history of superficial vein thrombosis

- **Incidence**: Estimated at 3â€“11%.

- **Complications**:
  - Possible development of DVT or PE.
  - Infection.
  - Skin changes (hyperpigmentation, firm subcutaneous nodule).
  - Recurrence of varicose veins if valves are damaged.

- **Symptoms**: 
  - Pain, tenderness, itching, reddening of skin, hardening of tissue.
  - Pigmentation changes of the skin.

- **Assessment**:
  - **Symptoms**: Duration and severity.
  - **Risk Factors**: Identify contributing factors.
  - **Typical Features**: Assess for characteristics of superficial vein thrombosis.
  - **Complications**: Check for DVT, PE, and infections.
  - **Differential Diagnoses**: Exclude tendonitis, venous skin changes, vasculitic conditions (e.g., erythema nodosum).

- **Management**:
  - **Referral**: For serious underlying causes (e.g., cancer).
  - **Pain Management**: Use NSAIDs and/or paracetamol.
  - **Self-Care**: 
    - Warm moist towel application.
    - Avoid immobility.
    - Elevate affected leg when sitting.
  - **Vascular Service Referral**: For duplex scanning if needed.
  - **Compression Stockings**: After ruling out arterial insufficiency.
  - **Coagulation Disorder Screening**: For recurrent cases without obvious cause/risk factor.
  - **Antibiotics**: Only if infection is present.
  - **Medications**: 
    - Low molecular weight heparin and fondaparinux reduce risk of extension and recurrence.
    - Fondaparinux also decreases risk of symptomatic venous thromboembolism.
