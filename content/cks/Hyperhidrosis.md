## Hyperhidrosis Summary

### Definition
- **Hyperhidrosis**: Excessive sweating beyond normal body temperature regulation.

### Classification
1. **By Location**:
   - **Focal**: Specific body areas affected.
   - **Generalized**: Entire skin surface involved.

2. **By Cause**:
   - **Primary**: No underlying cause (also known as primary idiopathic, primary localized, or focal hyperhidrosis).
     - Commonly affects axillae, palms, soles, face, scalp, and groin.
     - Unknown cause; 30-50% may have a positive family history (suggestive of genetic association).
   - **Secondary**: Caused by an underlying condition (specific areas affected).
     - May include conditions like anxiety, heart failure, infections, malignancy, endocrine/metabolic issues, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, drug/alcohol use.

### Prevalence
- True prevalence is unclear; often under-reported by patients and under-diagnosed by healthcare professionals.

### Complications
- Reduced quality of life
- Anxiety and depression
- Bromhidrosis (unpleasant body odor)
- Skin maceration
- Bacterial and fungal skin infections
- Pitted keratolysis

### Assessment
- **History Taking**:
  - Location, frequency, and duration of sweating episodes
  - Age of onset
  - Triggers
  - Systemic symptoms and night sweating (indicates possible underlying cause)
  - Drug treatments or misuse
  - Psychosocial impact
  - Family history
  - Associated co-morbidities

- **Examination**:
  - Visible excessive sweating location/distribution
  - Complications
  - Signs of underlying causes for secondary hyperhidrosis

- **Investigations**:
  - Baseline investigations and/or specialist referral if secondary hyperhidrosis is suspected.

### Management
- **Primary Focal Hyperhidrosis**:
  - Avoid identified triggers.
  - Self-care management strategies.
  - Provide information and support resources.
  - Use of topical aluminum salt preparations (e.g., roll-on antiperspirants, sprays) for symptom relief.
  - Manage skin irritation from treatments.
  - Address any underlying anxiety.
  - Refer to a dermatologist if:
    - Self-care measures and topical treatments are ineffective after six weeks.
    - Treatments are not tolerated.
