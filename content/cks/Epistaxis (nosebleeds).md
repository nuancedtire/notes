## Epistaxis (Nosebleeds) Summary

### Definition
- **Epistaxis**: Bleeding from the nose due to damage to nasal mucosa blood vessels.

### Characteristics
- Most cases are self-limiting and harmless.
- Often, the cause of bleeding is unidentified.

### Local Causes
- **Trauma**
- **Inflammation**
- **Topical drugs** (e.g., corticosteroids)
- **Surgery**
- **Vascular conditions** (e.g., hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, Wegener's granulomatosis)
- **Tumors** (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma)

### General Causes
- **Hypertension**
- **[[Atherosclerosis]]**
- **Increased venous pressure** (e.g., mitral stenosis)
- **Hematological disorders** (e.g., thrombocytopenia, leukemia, hemophilia)
- **Environmental factors** (e.g., temperature, humidity, altitude)
- **Systemic drugs** (e.g., anticoagulants, antiplatelets)
- **Excessive alcohol consumption**

### Complications
- Rare complications include:
  - **Hypovolaemia**
  - **Anaemia**
  - Complications from nasal packing treatment

### Emergency Management
- If haemodynamically compromised, treat as an emergency:
  - Immediate transfer to Accident and Emergency.
  - First-aid measures while awaiting ambulance:
    - Sit with upper body tilted forward, mouth open.
    - Pinch the soft part of the nose for 10-15 minutes.

### Non-Emergency Management
- If stable:
  - First-aid measures typically suffice.
  - For suspected posterior bleed (profuse bleeding, both nostrils, unidentified site), hospital admission is recommended.
- If bleeding stops:
  - Apply topical antiseptic (e.g., Naseptin®) to prevent re-bleeding.
- Self-care advice:
  - Avoid nose picking and heavy lifting for 24 hours post-bleed.

### Referral Considerations
- Consider referral if:
  - Epistaxis in children under 2 years (rare occurrence).
  - Likely underlying causes (e.g., hemophilia, leukemia).

### Further Management
- If bleeding persists after 10-15 minutes of pressure:
  - Use nasal cautery or packing if expertise/facilities are available.
  - Otherwise, transfer to Accident and Emergency.

### Investigations
- Rarely needed in primary care, but may include:
  - **Full blood count**: if heavy/recurrent bleeding or suspected anaemia.
  - **Coagulation studies**: if clotting disorder suspected or on warfarin.

### Recurrent Epistaxis Management
- Options include:
  - Topical antiseptic (e.g., Naseptin®) for crusting and vestibulitis.
  - Nasal cautery (if expertise available).
  - Referral to ear, nose, and throat specialist for recurrent cases or high-risk underlying causes.
