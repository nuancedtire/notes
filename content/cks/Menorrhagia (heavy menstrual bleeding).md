- **Definition**: Menorrhagia (heavy menstrual bleeding) is excessive menstrual blood loss affecting quality of life.

- **Prevalence**: 
  - 12% of gynaecology referrals are due to menstrual disorders.
  - 1 in 20 women aged 30–49 consult their GP yearly for heavy periods or menstrual issues.

- **Causes**: 
  - Often no underlying cause (50% of cases).
  - Possible causes include:
    - Uterine fibroids
    - Uterine cancer
    - Endometriosis
    - Systemic disorders (e.g., coagulation disorders, hypothyroidism)
    - Medications (e.g., anticoagulants)

- **Diagnosis**: 
  - Detailed clinical history.
  - Consider physical examination and investigations based on symptoms:
    - Offer physical examination if there are related symptoms (e.g., intermenstrual bleeding, pelvic pain).
    - Pharmacological treatment may be considered without physical examination if no related symptoms (unless using LNG IUS).
    - If low risk of fibroids or uterine abnormalities, consider pharmacological treatment without further investigation.
  - Full blood count to rule out iron deficiency anemia.
  - Other investigations based on history and clinical findings.

- **Treatment Options**:
  - For women without identified pathology, with fibroids <3 cm, or suspected adenomyosis:
    - Offer LNG-IUS.
    - If declined/unsuitable, consider:
      - Tranexamic acid
      - NSAIDs
      - Hormonal treatments (combined hormonal contraception, cyclical oral progestogens)
  - If treatment fails, the woman declines pharmacological treatment, or symptoms are severe:
    - Refer to a specialist for further investigations and alternative treatments.
  
- **For women with fibroids ≥3 cm**:
  - Refer to a specialist for additional investigations and treatment options.
  - While awaiting treatment/referral, offer tranexamic acid and/or NSAIDs.

- **Referral Indications**:
  - Ascites or pelvic/abdominal mass not clearly due to fibroids.
  - Pelvic mass with cancer features (unexplained bleeding, weight loss).
  - Complications (e.g., dyspareunia, pelvic pain, urinary symptoms from large fibroids).
  - Iron deficiency anemia unresponsive to treatment after excluding other causes.
