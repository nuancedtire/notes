**Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Summary**

- **Definition**: Chronic systemic inflammatory disease.
  
- **Presentation**:
  - Inflammatory arthritis affecting small joints of hands and feet (symmetrically).
  - Any synovial joint may be involved.
  
- **Progression**: 
  - Affects any body system, increasing risk of premature death.
  
- **Complications/Comorbidities**:
  - Cardiovascular disease
  - Osteoporosis
  - Anaemia
  - Infection
  
- **Epidemiology**:
  - Affects ~1% of the UK population.
  - Incidence increases with age; peak onset at 30–50 years.
  - 2–4 times more common in women than men.
  
- **Clinical Features of Synovitis**:
  - Pain, swelling, heat, and stiffness in affected joints.

- **Referral Guidelines**:
  - Suspected RA should be referred for specialist assessment within 3 weeks.
  - Urgent referral (within 3 working days) if:
    - Small joints of hands/feet affected.
    - More than one joint affected.
    - Delay of 3 months or longer before seeking medical advice.
  
- **Initial Management**:
  - Consider NSAID at lowest effective dose (short term).
  - Offer proton pump inhibitor (PPI) until rheumatology appointment.

- **Specialist Management**:
  - Treat to target strategy aimed at remission or low disease activity.
  - Conventional DMARD (cDMARD) as monotherapy (e.g., methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine).
    - Dose escalated based on tolerance.
  - Hydroxychloroquine for palindromic disease.
  - Short-term glucocorticoids for symptom relief when starting new cDMARD.
  - Additional cDMARDs in a step-up strategy if targets not met.

- **Severe Disease Management**:
  - Biological DMARDs may be offered if severe and unresponsive to intensive therapy with cDMARDs.

- **Management of RA Flare in Primary Care**:
  - Exclude septic arthritis.
  - Seek specialist advice.
  - Offer short-term glucocorticoids (intra-articular, intramuscular, or oral).
  
- **Surgical Referral Indications**:
  - Persistent pain due to joint damage.
  - Worsening joint function.
  - Progressive deformity.
  - Persistent localized synovitis.
  - Imminent or actual tendon rupture.
  - Nerve compression.
