- **Definition**: Renal or ureteric colic is acute, severe loin pain caused by a urinary stone moving from the kidney or obstructing urine flow.
- **Incidence**: Common, with an annual incidence of 1-2 cases per 1000 people; high recurrence rates.

### Assessment
1. **Symptoms**:
   - Severe unilateral abdominal pain (loin/flank) radiating to:
     - Labia (women)
     - Groin/testicle (men)
   - Accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and haematuria.
   
2. **Risk Factors**:
   - Chronic dehydration
   - Family history
   - Gastrointestinal conditions (e.g., Crohn's disease)
   - Certain medications (e.g., protease inhibitors)

3. **Examination**:
   - Perform abdominal examination to exclude differential diagnoses (e.g., [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Appendicitis|appendicitis]], diverticulitis).
   - Assess for complications:
     - Hesitancy of micturition or intermittent urinary stream (urinary tract obstruction)
     - Fever and sweats (suggesting urinary tract infection)

### Immediate Hospital Admission Criteria
- Signs of shock or systemic infection (e.g., fever, sweats)
- Increased risk of acute kidney injury (e.g., chronic kidney disease, solitary/transplanted kidney, bilateral obstructing stones)
- Dehydration with inability to take oral fluids (due to nausea/vomiting)
- Uncertainty about diagnosis

### Management for Non-Emergency Cases
- **Urgent Imaging** (within 24 hours):
  - Low-dose non-contrast CT for adults
  - Ultrasound for pregnant women, children, and young people
  
- **Pain Relief**:
  - NSAID by any route 
  - If contraindicated/ineffective, offer IV paracetamol
  - Consider opioid analgesic if both NSAIDs and IV paracetamol are contraindicated/ineffective.

### Management of Urinary Stones
- Factors affecting management:
  - Size, severity of symptoms, location of the stone, age of the person.
  
- **Options**:
  - Watchful waiting
  - Medical expulsive therapy
  - Surgical treatment

### Recurrence Prevention
- **Lifestyle and Dietary Advice**:
  - Increase fluid intake
  - Add fresh lemon juice to water
  - Avoid carbonated drinks
  - Reduce salt intake
  - Maintain normal dietary calcium intake
  - Eat a balanced diet
  - Maintain a healthy weight
  
- **Medications**:
  - **Potassium citrate**: for adults and children with recurrent calcium oxalate stones (more than 50%) and hypercalciuria/hypocitraturia.
  - **Thiazide treatment**: for adults with recurrent calcium oxalate stones (more than 50%) and hypercalciuria, after sodium intake restriction (max 6 g/day).
