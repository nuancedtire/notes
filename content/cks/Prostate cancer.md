- **Definition**: Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor of the prostate, predominantly adenocarcinoma (95%).

- **Characteristics**:
  - Multifocal nature with different genetic mutations.
  - Growth rates and metastasis abilities vary.
  - Most cases are indolent; a minority are aggressive.

- **Stages**:
  - **Localized Prostate Cancer**: Typically asymptomatic, develops in the outer zone of the prostate.
  - **Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer**: Extends beyond the prostate capsule, often asymptomatic at diagnosis.
  - **Metastatic Prostate Cancer**: Commonly affects bones, leading to pain and fragility fractures.

- **Epidemiology**:
  - Most common cancer in men.
  - Second leading cause of cancer death in males in the UK (after lung cancer).

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Increasing age.
  - Black ethnicity.
  - Family history of prostate cancer.

- **Symptoms to Suspect Prostate Cancer**:
  - Unexplained lower back or bone pain.
  - Lethargy.
  - Erectile dysfunction.
  - Haematuria.
  - Anorexia or weight loss.
  - Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS): frequency, urgency, hesitancy, terminal dribbling, overactive bladder.

- **Assessment**:
  - Digital rectal examination (DRE).
  - Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.
  - Urgent referral to a urological cancer specialist if:
    - Prostate is hard and nodular on DRE.
    - Benign enlargement noted.
    - PSA level exceeds age-specific threshold (e.g., >4.5 for ages 60-69).

- **Treatment**:
  - Managed in secondary care, options include:
    - Watchful waiting.
    - Active surveillance.
    - Radical treatments (prostatectomy, radiotherapy).
    - Adjunctive and palliative treatments (hormonal therapy, chemotherapy).
  - Primary care involved in shared care, follow-up, and monitoring.
