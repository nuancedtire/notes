- **Definition**: 
  - Low back pain refers to pain in the lumbosacral area (from 12th ribs to iliac crest) and sometimes includes buttocks and gluteal folds.
  - 'Non-specific' low back pain is pain not attributable to an underlying cause; also known as 'mechanical', 'musculoskeletal', or 'simple' low back pain.

- **Duration**:
  - Acute low back pain: lasts less than 3 months.
  - Chronic low back pain: lasts 3 months or more.

- **Prevalence**:
  - Non-specific low back pain accounts for 90-95% of low back pain cases in primary care.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Obesity
  - Physical inactivity
  - Heavy lifting
  - Stress or depression

- **Prognosis**:
  - Generally self-limiting; most cases resolve within a few weeks.
  
- **Complications**:
  - Impact on daily activities (work, study, leisure, sleep)
  - Depression and anxiety
  - Increased risk of falls and chronic pain

- **Assessment**:
  - **History**:
    - Onset, type, site, and pattern of pain
    - Pain radiation, duration, associated symptoms, red flags
    - Impact on daily functioning, drug treatments
  - **Examination**:
    - Gait, posture, localized tenderness, range of movement
    - Red flags and neurological examination
  - **Risk Stratification**: 
    - Use screening tools to assess risk for prolonged or complex recovery if non-specific low back pain is suspected.

- **Management**:
  - **Emergency Care**: 
    - Immediate referral or admission if red flags or serious underlying causes are suspected.
  - **Information & Support**:
    - Advise on reliable sources of information and self-management strategies.
  - **Self-Management**:
    - Encourage staying active, resuming normal activities, using local heat for symptom relief.
  - **Pharmacotherapy**:
    - First-line: NSAIDs
    - Second-line: Short-term codeine with or without paracetamol.
  - **Other Treatments**:
    - Exercise programs, manual therapy, psychological support for those at risk of prolonged recovery.
  - **Occupational Health**: 
    - Assess if necessary.
  - **Follow-Up**:
    - Review if symptoms persist or worsen after 3-4 weeks, reassess for underlying causes.
  - **Manage Risk Factors**: 
    - Address any risk factors for prolonged recovery.
  - **Referral**: 
    - Consider referral to a specialist back pain service if chronic pain persists and non-invasive treatments are ineffective.
