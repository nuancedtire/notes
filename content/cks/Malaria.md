- **Overview**
  - Malaria is a life-threatening illness caused by Plasmodium parasites infecting red blood cells.
  - Transmission occurs through bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes.

- **Plasmodium Species Causing Malaria**
  - **Plasmodium falciparum**: Major cause of malaria-related deaths worldwide.
  - **Plasmodium vivax** and **Plasmodium ovale**: Have dormant liver stages, causing relapses months or years after initial infection.
  - **Plasmodium malariae**: Can lead to lifelong chronic infection if untreated.
  - **Plasmodium knowlesi**: Monkey malaria parasite in Southeast Asia, can cause severe illness in humans.

- **Diagnosis and Treatment**
  - Prompt identification and treatment lead to rapid recovery if no organ dysfunction occurs.
  - Delayed or inappropriate treatment can result in severe or fatal malaria.
  - Suspect malaria in individuals returning from endemic areas with fever or illness, regardless of prophylaxis.
  - Missed cases often misdiagnosed as viral infections, flu, gastroenteritis, or hepatitis.

- **Clinical Features**
  - Non-specific symptoms include:
    - Fever, sweats, chills (absence of fever does not exclude malaria)
    - Headache
    - Confusion
    - General malaise, lethargy, fatigue (somnolence more common in children)
    - Myalgia and arthralgia
    - Gastrointestinal issues (nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea)
    - Anorexia, poor feeding in children
    - Jaundice
    - Respiratory symptoms (sore throat, cough, distress)

- **Symptoms of Severe Malaria**
  - Impaired consciousness, seizures, prostration
  - Renal impairment (may present as oliguria)
  - Acidosis (may present as acidotic breathing)
  - Hypoglycaemia (common in pregnant women)
  - Respiratory distress (pulmonary edema, ARDS)
  - Severe anemia (may present with pallor)
  - Spontaneous bleeding/DIC
  - Shock
  - Sepsis (more common in pregnant women)
  - Haemoglobinuria (severe hemolysis, "blackwater fever")

- **Emergency Protocols**
  - Immediate admission for:
    - Suspected severe or complicated malaria
    - Suspected falciparum malaria
    - Pregnant women
    - Individuals over 65 years of age
  - Other suspected cases should be discussed urgently with an infectious disease specialist; outpatient treatment may be possible for adults in experienced settings.
  
- **Reporting**
  - All malaria cases must be notified to Public Health England.
