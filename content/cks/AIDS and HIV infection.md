- **HIV Overview**
  - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that primarily targets and destroys immune system cells, specifically CD4 T lymphocytes.

- **Transmission Routes**
  - **Sexual Activity**: Through infected body fluids.
  - **Vertical Transmission**: From mother to child during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding.
  - **Inoculation**: Via contaminated needles, instruments, blood products, or exposure of mucous membranes/open wounds to infected fluids; also includes human bites that break the skin.

- **Primary HIV Infection (PHI)**
  - Often presents as flu-like illness within weeks of infection.
  - Can range from mild to severe.
  - Highly infectious during this phase.

- **Progression of HIV Infection**
  - **Asymptomatic Stage**: After PHI symptoms resolve; progression can vary.
    - Rapid progression to advanced HIV/AIDS within 1-2 years for some.
    - Others may remain immunocompetent for over 10 years.
  - **Advanced HIV Infection**: Defined by CD4 cell count < 200 cells/µL and development of opportunistic infections (e.g., pneumocystis pneumonia) or malignancies (e.g., Kaposi’s sarcoma).

- **Alerting Features for HIV Consideration**
  - Unusual or severe, recurrent, or prolonged common symptoms/infections.
  - Persistent enlarged lymph nodes (excluding inguinal area).
  - Immunosuppression-related conditions.
  - Glandular fever-like illness.
  - Lifestyle/social risk factors (e.g., high-prevalence areas, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users).

- **HIV Testing Recommendations**
  - Offered in primary care:
    - As part of routine antenatal care.
    - Upon request, with known risk factors, or with another sexually transmitted infection.
    - For new practice registrants or those having blood tests if no HIV test in the past 12 months (in areas with diagnosed HIV prevalence > 2 per 1000).
    - For individuals presenting with PHI symptoms or longstanding HIV infection.

- **Management of HIV**
  - Complex management provided by specialist HIV services in secondary care.
  - **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**:
    - Initiated and monitored in secondary care.
    - Can have serious or life-threatening adverse effects; monitoring in primary care is essential.
    - Potential for serious interactions with other medications; check interactions before prescribing.
    - Significantly improves prognosis—adherent individuals can expect near-normal lifespan.

- **Medical Emergency Protocols**
  - Potential occupational or sexual exposure to HIV requires urgent referral for post-exposure prophylaxis consideration.
