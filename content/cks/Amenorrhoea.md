## Amenorrhoea: Summary

### Definitions
- **Amenorrhoea**: Absence or cessation of menstruation.
  - **Primary Amenorrhoea**: Failure to establish menstruation by expected age (15-16 years with secondary sexual characteristics; 13-14 years without).
  - **Secondary Amenorrhoea**: Cessation of established menstruation for 3 cycles or 6+ months.

### Causes
- **Primary Amenorrhoea Causes**:
  - Anatomical abnormalities (genetic/congenital).
  - Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea (eating disorders, stress, weight loss, excessive exercise).
  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

- **Secondary Amenorrhoea Causes**:
  - PCOS.
  - Functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea.
  - Premature ovarian insufficiency.
  - Hyperprolactinaemia.

### Diagnostic Approach
- Conduct thorough history and examination.
- Preliminary investigations that may be considered:
  - Ultrasound.
  - Serum prolactin.
  - Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
  - Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).
  - Oestradiol.
  - Total testosterone (if features of androgen excess).

### Referral Guidelines
#### Gynaecologist Referral for Secondary Amenorrhoea:
- Elevated FSH and LH levels (younger than 40 years).
- Recent uterine/cervical surgery or severe pelvic infection.
- Infertility.
- Suspected PCOS (unclear diagnosis or complications).

#### Endocrinologist Referral for Secondary Amenorrhoea:
- Hyperprolactinaemia.
- Low FSH and LH.
- Increased testosterone level not explained by PCOS.
- Features of Cushing's syndrome or late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

### Management
- **Primary Care**: 
  - Manage secondary amenorrhoea due to PCOS, hypothyroidism, menopause, or pregnancy.
  - Manage weight loss, excessive exercise, stress, or chronic illness after excluding hypothalamic/pituitary causes.
  - If eating disorder suspected, refer to community eating disorders service.
