- **[[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|Gallstones]] (Cholelithiasis)**: Solid deposits forming in the gallbladder; gallstone disease refers to the presence of stones in the gallbladder or biliary tree, along with associated symptoms and complications.

- **Formation Causes**:
  - Problematic chemical composition of bile leading to precipitation.
  - Cholesterol gallstone formation due to:
    - Cholesterol supersaturation.
    - Accelerated cholesterol crystal nucleation.
    - Impaired gallbladder motility.

- **Prevalence**: Approximately 10â€“15% of adults in Europe and the U.S. have [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|gallstones]].

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Crohn's disease.
  - Diabetes mellitus.
  - Diet (high in triglycerides/refined carbs, low in fiber).
  - Female sex.
  - Genetic and ethnic factors.
  - Increasing age.
  - Certain medications (e.g., somatostatin analogues, GLP-1 analogues, ceftriaxone).
  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
  - Obesity.
  - Prolonged fasting/weight loss.
  - Hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

- **Symptoms**: Most individuals are asymptomatic; 2-4% of asymptomatic cases may develop symptoms or complications annually.

- **Common Complications**:
  - Biliary colic (most common).
  - Acute [[cholecystitis]] (second most common).
  - Other rare but life-threatening complications: cholangitis, pancreatitis.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Abdominal ultrasound and liver function tests (LFTs) for suspected cases.
  - If ultrasound is inconclusive but suspicion remains, further tests (MRCP or EUS) may be necessary.

- **Treatment**:
  - No treatment for asymptomatic [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|gallstones]] in a normal gallbladder and biliary tree.
  - Referral for asymptomatic [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|gallstones]] in the common bile duct for bile duct clearance and laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
  - Emergency admission for systemic illness with suspected complications (acute [[cholecystitis]], cholangitis, pancreatitis).
  - Urgent referral for jaundice or suspected biliary obstruction.
  - Symptomatic patients should be referred for laparoscopic cholecystectomy based on clinical judgment.

- **Pain Management**:
  - Offer appropriate pain relief while awaiting assessment:
    - Severe pain: diclofenac or opioid (IM).
    - Mild to moderate pain: paracetamol or NSAID.
  - Refer to hospital if pain cannot be managed in primary care.
