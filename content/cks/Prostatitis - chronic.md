- **Definition**: Chronic prostatitis is defined as at least 3 months of urogenital pain (perineal, suprapubic, inguinal, rectal, testicular, or penile), often with lower urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, urgency) and sexual dysfunction (erectile dysfunction, painful ejaculation, postcoital pelvic discomfort).

- **Diagnosis**: 
  - Often suspected after a shorter duration of symptoms.
  - Exclusion of other conditions is essential (e.g., urinary tract infection, urethritis, epididymo-orchitis, epididymitis, benign prostatic hypertrophy, prostate/bladder/colon cancer, urethral stricture, obstructive calculus/foreign body).
  
- **Classification**: 
  - **Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis (CBP)**: Accounts for ~10% of cases.
  - **Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS)**: Accounts for ~90% (no proven bacterial infection).

- **Quality of Life**: Men with chronic prostatitis often experience significantly reduced quality of life; symptoms may improve over months or years.

- **Symptoms to Suspect Chronic Prostatitis**:
  - Urogenital pain (perineum, lower abdomen, penis, testis, rectum, lower back).
  - Urinary symptoms (dysuria, frequency, hesitancy, urgency, poor stream).

- **Management**:
  - **For suspected CBP**:
    - Refer to urology for assessment and management.
    - Prescribe a single course of antibiotics.
    - If in pain, prescribe paracetamol and/or NSAIDs.
    - If defecation is painful, prescribe a stool softener (lactulose or docusate).

  - **For suspected CP/CPPS**:
    - Refer to urology if there's diagnostic uncertainty or severe symptoms.
    - Prescribe paracetamol and/or NSAIDs for pain relief.
    - Prescribe stool softener if defecation is painful.
    - Offer a 4-6 week trial of an alpha-blocker if significant urinary tract symptoms are present.
    - Offer a single course of antibiotics if symptoms have been present for <6 months.
    - Refer to a urologist if symptoms persist.
