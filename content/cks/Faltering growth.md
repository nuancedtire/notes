## Faltering Growth: Quick Revision Guide

### Definition
- **Faltering Growth**: Slower rate of weight gain in childhood than expected for age and sex.

### Monitoring in the UK
- **Growth Charts**: Combine WHO growth standards and UK birth/preterm growth data.
- **Centiles**: Percentile lines on charts indicating the weight/height below which a specific percentage of children fall (e.g., 25% below the 25th percentile).
- **Plotting**: Child's weight, height, and head circumference plotted over time; slower weight gain moves measurements to a lower centile.

### Early Life Considerations
- Common weight loss: Up to 10% of birth weight due to fluid adjustments.
- Concern if:
  - Weight loss exceeds 10% of birth weight.
  - Weight does not return to birth weight by 3 weeks.

### Causes of Faltering Growth
1. **Inadequate Calorie Intake** (most common cause).
2. **Inadequate Nutrient Absorption**.
3. **Increased Calorie Demand/Expenditure**.

### Contributing Risk Factors
- **Feeding Problems**:
  - Ineffective suckling.
  - Inadequate breast milk.
  - Incorrect infant formula preparation.
- **Medical Conditions**:
  - Constipation.
  - Cleft palate.
  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux.
  - Coeliac disease.
  - Diabetes.
- **Parent/Carer Interactions**: Poor responses to mealtime cues.
- **Access to Healthy Food**: Limited availability.
- **Family Stress**: Divorce, housing issues, substance misuse, financial problems, maternal postnatal depression/anxiety.
- **Child Maltreatment**.

### Management Strategies
- **Initial Assessment**: Identify risk factors and exclude differential diagnoses (e.g., prematurity).
- **Community-Based Support**: Increase energy intake and manage feeding challenges.
- **Growth Monitoring**: Regular intervals, recorded in Personal Child Health Record.

### Referral Considerations
- **Paediatrics**: For evidence of illness, marked weight loss, or lack of response to primary care feeding support.
- **Other Professionals**: Referral to dietitians, psychologists, speech and language therapists, or social services as needed.
