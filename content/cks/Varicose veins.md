## Varicose Veins Summary

- **Definition**:  
  - Dilated, tortuous, superficial veins, primarily in the legs.
  - Indicate superficial lower extremity venous insufficiency.

- **Causes**:  
  - Incompetent valves lead to blood reflux and increased distal vein pressure.
  - Superficial veins cannot withstand high pressure, resulting in dilation.

- **Risk Factors**:  
  - Increasing age
  - Family history of varicose veins
  - Female sex
  - Pregnancy
  - Obesity
  - Prolonged standing or sitting
  - History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

- **Symptoms**:  
  - Often cosmetic concerns
  - Possible symptoms: pain, aching, discomfort, swelling, heaviness, itching
  - Can impact quality of life

- **Complications**:  
  - Bleeding
  - Changes in skin pigmentation
  - Superficial vein thrombosis
  - DVT
  - Venous ulceration

- **Assessment**:  
  - Inquire about symptoms related to varicose veins.
  - Review previous interventions and history (trauma, DVT, ulcerations, bleeding).
  - Identify risk factors and patient concerns.
  - Check for complications (skin pigmentation changes, leg ulceration).

- **Management**:  
  - **If bleeding**: Provide first aid and arrange admission to a vascular service.
  - **If not bleeding**:  
    - Provide information and reassurance about complications.
    - Offer self-care advice: 
      - Weight loss (if applicable)
      - Avoid prolonged sitting/standing
      - Elevate legs when possible
    - Consider referral to vascular service for interventional treatment (endothermal ablation, foam sclerotherapy, surgery).
    - Offer compression stockings (after excluding arterial insufficiency).

- **Special Note for Pregnant Women**:  
  - Common occurrence; usually improve post-pregnancy.
  - Interventional treatments are rarely an option, except in exceptional circumstances.
