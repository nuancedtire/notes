- **Lead Agency**: Local authority is the primary agency for adult safeguarding and should be notified of suspected abuse or neglect.

- **Types of Abuse**:
  - **Individual Abuse**: Can be physical, verbal, psychological, neglect, or omission. Perpetrators can include volunteers, visitors, family members, carers, and staff.
    - **Forms of Individual Abuse**:
      - Physical abuse
      - Sexual abuse
      - Psychological abuse
      - Financial/material abuse
