### Cellulitis - Acute: Summary

- **Definition**: Acute bacterial infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.
- **Commonly Affected Area**: Lower limb.
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Pain
  - Warmth
  - Swelling
  - Erythema
  - Possible blisters and bullae
  - Accompanying symptoms: Fever, malaise, nausea, rigors.

- **Causes**: 
  - Microorganisms (most commonly **Streptococcus pyogenes** and **Staphylococcus aureus**) enter through disruptions in the cutaneous barrier.
  
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Skin trauma
  - Ulceration
  - Obesity

- **Complications**:
  - Necrotizing fasciitis
  - Sepsis
  - Persistent leg ulceration
  - Recurrent cellulitis

- **Recurrence**: Common, with each episode increasing the likelihood of subsequent recurrences.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Typically based on history and examination.
  - Investigations may include swabs for culture in specific cases (e.g., penetrating injury, exposure to water-borne organisms, infections acquired outside the UK).

- **Differential Diagnoses**:
  - Deep venous thrombosis
  - Septic arthritis
  - Acute gout
  - Ruptured Baker's cyst

- **Eron Classification**: Useful for guiding management decisions.

- **Referral to Hospital**:
  - Signs/symptoms indicating more serious conditions.
  - Signs of systemic illness.
  - Comorbidities complicating recovery.
  - Limb-threatening infections due to vascular compromise.
  - Severe immunocompromised status.

- **Hospital Admission Considerations**:
  - Severe illness, frailty, immunocompromised, elderly, or very young patients.
  - Facial cellulitis (unless very mild).
  - Infections near eyes/nose (including periorbital cellulitis).
  - Spreading infections not responding to oral antibiotics.
  - Presence of lymphangitis.
  - Inability to take oral antibiotics.
  - Possible uncommon pathogens (e.g., after penetrating injury or exposure to water-borne organisms).

- **Primary Care Management of Uncomplicated Cellulitis**:
  - Prescribe appropriate antibiotics.
  - Advise on analgesia for pain relief.
  - Encourage adequate fluid intake.
  - Elevate the leg for comfort and to relieve edema (when applicable).
  - Educate when to seek immediate medical review (e.g., if antibiotics are not tolerated or if systemic symptoms worsen).
  - Manage underlying risk factors.
  - Identify and manage comorbidities (e.g., diabetes) that may cause rapid spread or delayed healing.
  - Recommend preventative measures to reduce recurrence risk (e.g., weight loss, emollients for dry skin).
  - Provide patient information on cellulitis.
  - Reassess when appropriate.
