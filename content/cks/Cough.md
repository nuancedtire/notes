- **Cough Overview**
  - Reflex response to airway irritation.
  - Triggered by stimulation of airway cough receptors (irritants or airway distortion).

- **Types of Cough**
  - **Acute Cough**: < 3 weeks
    - Common Causes:
      - Viral upper respiratory tract infection
      - Acute bronchitis
      - Pneumonia
      - Acute exacerbations of asthma, COPD, or bronchiectasis
      - Pneumothorax
      - Pulmonary embolism
  - **Sub-Acute Cough**: 3â€“8 weeks
    - Common Cause:
      - Post-infectious cough (e.g., Mycoplasma pneumonia, Bordetella pertussis)
  - **Chronic Cough**: > 8 weeks
    - Common Causes:
      - Smoking
      - ACE inhibitors
      - Upper airway cough syndrome (post-nasal drip)
      - Asthma
      - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
      - Eosinophilic bronchitis

- **Other Causes of Cough**
  - Bronchiectasis
  - Bronchitis
  - COPD
  - Cough variant asthma
  - Environmental/occupational factors
  - Foreign body aspiration
  - Heart failure
  - Interstitial lung disease
  - Lung cancer
  - Obstructive sleep apnoea
  - Pertussis
  - Pulmonary tuberculosis
  - Somatic cough syndrome
  - Thoracic aortic aneurysm

- **Diagnosis**
  - Thorough history and examination.
  - Investigations (if appropriate):
    - Pulse oximetry (if acutely unwell)
    - Peak expiratory flow rate (if asthma suspected)
    - Pertussis serology (if whooping cough suspected)
    - C-reactive protein (if pneumonia suspected)
    - Spirometry and chest X-ray (if chronic cough of uncertain cause)

- **Emergency Admission Criteria**
  - Suspected pulmonary embolism or pneumothorax.
  - Clinical features of foreign body aspiration.
  - Signs of serious illness:
    - Respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min
    - Tachycardia > 130 beats/min
    - Systolic BP < 90 mmHg
    - Oxygen saturation < 92% or central cyanosis (without chronic hypoxia)
    - Peak expiratory flow rate < 33% of predicted
    - Altered consciousness
    - Use of accessory muscles of respiration (especially if exhausted)

- **Management**
  - Based on treating underlying cause or sequential trials to confirm/refute common causes.
  - Referral to a respiratory physician for:
    - Cough not responding to treatment trials.
    - Uncertain diagnosis.
