### Melanoma Overview

- **Definition**: Malignant tumor from melanocytes in the skin.
- **Common Subtypes**:
  - Superficial spreading melanoma
  - Nodular melanoma
  - Lentigo maligna melanoma
  - Acral lentiginous melanoma

### Other Pigmented Lesions
- Dermatofibromas
- Freckles
- Lentigines
- Moles (naevi):
  - Blue naevi
  - Halo naevi
  - Meyerson's naevi
- Pigmented basal cell carcinomas
- Seborrhoeic keratoses

### Statistics
- **Ranking**: 5th most common cancer in the UK
- **Incidence**: ~4% of new cancer cases
- **Deaths**: More than all other skin cancers combined
- **Projected Increase**: 7% from 2014 to 2035
- **Average Cases (2016-2018)**: 16,744 new cases annually in the UK

### Risk Factors
- Personal history of skin cancer, melanoma, or atypical naevi
- Family history of melanoma
- Pale skin (Fitzpatrick Skin Types I and II)
- Red or light-colored hair
- High freckle density
- Light-colored eyes
- History of sunburn (especially blistering in childhood)
- Large number of moles or large congenital naevi
- Sun exposure
- Use of tanning beds
- Increasing age
- Outdoor occupation
- Immunosuppression
- Genetic syndromes (e.g., xeroderma pigmentosum)

### Prognosis
- Dependent on stage at diagnosis
- Key prognostic indicators:
  - Breslow's thickness of the tumor
  - Lymph node status

### Assessment Guidelines
1. **Medical History**: Obtain a thorough history.
2. **Examination**: Inspect lesions and entire skin surface.
   - Look for atypical melanocytic lesions (Ugly Duckling sign).
3. **7-point Checklist**: Use to assess pigmented lesions and determine referral need.

### Referral Criteria
- Urgent referral (within 2 weeks) if:
  - 7-point checklist score is 3 or more.
  - Dermoscopy suggests melanoma.
  - Nail changes (new pigmented line, damage).
  - New persistent skin condition (growing, pigmented, or vascular).
  - Doubt about the lesion.
  - Biopsy confirms malignant melanoma.

### Note
- Avoid excision in primary care if melanoma is suspected.
