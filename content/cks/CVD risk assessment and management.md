- **Definition of CVD**: 
  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) encompasses conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, primarily caused by thrombosis or [[atherosclerosis]].

- **Impact of CVD**: 
  - Significant cause of mortality and morbidity.
  - Accounts for nearly 25% of all deaths in the UK.
  - In 2021, CVD was responsible for 21% of premature deaths (under 75 years).

- **Risk Factors**:
  - **Non-modifiable**:
    - Older age
    - Male sex
    - Family history of CVD
    - Ethnic background (e.g., higher risk in South Asian individuals)
  
  - **Modifiable**:
    - Smoking
    - High non-HDL cholesterol
    - Lack of physical activity
    - Unhealthy diet
    - Excessive alcohol intake
    - Overweight and obesity

- **Comorbidities Increasing CVD Risk**:
  - Hypertension
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Dyslipidaemia
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
  - Influenza
  - Serious mental health issues
  - Periodontitis

- **Health Check Programme**:
  - Target Group: Individuals aged 40â€“74 without a CVD, diabetes, or CKD diagnosis.
  - Frequency: Every 5 years.
  - Components:
    - CVD risk assessment
    - Assessment of alcohol consumption
    - Evaluation of physical activity
    - Cholesterol level measurement
    - Body mass index (BMI) assessment
    - Dementia screening (ages 65-74)
    - Diabetes and CKD screening for at-risk individuals

- **CVD Risk Assessment**:
  - Use of QRISK tool every 5 years for individuals without established CVD or high risk, and those under 85 years.
  - High-risk individuals: Type 1 diabetes or CKD stages 3-5 may not require assessment but can benefit from it for informed decision-making regarding statins.
  - Clinical judgment is essential to adjust calculated risk.

- **Lifestyle Modifications**:
  - All individuals assessed for CVD risk should receive lifestyle advice, including:
    - Smoking cessation
    - Weight loss for overweight or obese individuals
    - Healthy diet
    - Alcohol consumption within limits
    - Regular physical activity

- **Statin Treatment**:
  - Recommended for primary prevention if estimated 10-year CVD risk is 10% or more, and lifestyle interventions are ineffective.
  - Atorvastatin 20 mg daily is the preferred statin after informed discussion on benefits and risks, provided lifestyle advice has been given and there are no contraindications.
