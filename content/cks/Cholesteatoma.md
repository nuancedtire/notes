- **Definition**: Cholesteatoma is an abnormal sac of keratinizing squamous epithelium with keratin accumulation in the middle ear or mastoid air cell spaces, which can become infected and erode neighboring structures.

- **Incidence**: A GP with 2,500 patients may expect one new case every 4-5 years.

- **Symptoms**:
  - Early stages can be asymptomatic.
  - Common presentation includes persistent or recurrent foul-smelling ear discharge.
  - Associated conductive hearing loss may occur.
  - Rarely, progression may lead to:
    - Vertigo
    - Sensorineural hearing loss
    - Facial nerve palsy
    - Meningitis
    - Intracranial abscess

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Requires clear visualization of the tympanic membrane.
  - Suspected cholesteatoma if:
    - Evidence of ear discharge.
    - Deep retraction pocket with/without granulation tissue and skin debris.
    - Crust or keratin in the upper part of the tympanic membrane.
    - Possible perforation of the tympanic membrane.
  - **Congenital cholesteatoma**: Rare; appears as a white mass behind an intact tympanic membrane without prior history of discharge or perforation.

- **Management**:
  - If significant discharge occludes the tympanic membrane, consider:
    - Referral for otomicroscope examination and micro-suctioning.
    - Treat for presumed infection (e.g., otitis externa or acute otitis media) based on clinical judgment.
  - **Re-examination**: Necessary after treatment; refer to ENT if tympanic membrane remains obscured.
  - **Referral Timeline**: Do not delay referral for repeated treatments if discharge persists.

- **Emergency Cases**:
  - Arrange emergency admission for suspected cholesteatoma with serious complications, such as:
    - Facial nerve palsy or vertigo.
    - Neurological symptoms/signs suggesting intracranial abscess or meningitis.
  - Semi-urgent referral to ENT for suspected cholesteatoma without serious complications.
