## Cluster Headache - Summary

- **Definition**: Cluster headache is a rare primary headache disorder, classified by the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) as not associated with any underlying condition. It is the most common type of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia.

- **Characteristics**:
  - Recurring, localized, severe headaches.
  - Attacks are short-lasting but can be very intense.
  - Often accompanied by autonomic symptoms.

- **Attack Patterns**:
  - **Cluster Periods**: Attacks occur in series lasting from 2 weeks to 3 months.
  - **ICHD Classification**:
    - **Episodic**: 85–90% of cases; attacks last from 7 days to 1 year with pain-free intervals of at least 3 months.
    - **Chronic**: 10–15% of cases; attacks persist for over a year with remission periods shorter than 3 months.

- **Pathophysiology**: Complex and not fully understood; may involve neurovascular, genetic, and environmental factors (e.g., alcohol, smoking).

- **Impact on Quality of Life**: Can significantly affect work, home life, and relationships; severe symptoms may lead to suicidal ideation.

- **Natural History**: Older individuals may experience less frequent bouts and longer remission periods.

- **Diagnostic Criteria (ICHD)**:
  - At least five attacks of severe or very severe unilateral pain in the orbital, supraorbital, and/or temporal region.
  - Pain lasts 15 minutes to 3 hours (untreated).
  - At least one ipsilateral symptom:
    - Conjunctival injection/lacrimation
    - Nasal congestion/rhinorrhea
    - Eyelid swelling
    - Sweating/flushing of forehead/face
    - Sensation of fullness in the ear
    - Miosis/ptosis
  - Restlessness or agitation during attacks.

- **Management**:
  - **Initial Assessment**: Refer to specialists if red flags or serious underlying causes are suspected. Seek urgent neurology referral for suspected first bouts.
  
  - **Confirmed Cluster Headache**:
    - Provide information and support resources.
    - Assess and manage triggers and associated conditions.
    - **Drug Treatment for Acute Attacks**:
      - Use triptans (subcutaneous sumatriptan, intranasal sumatriptan/zolmitriptan).
      - High-flow 100% home oxygen for acute attacks.
      - Avoid oral triptans and other oral analgesics.
      
    - **Prophylaxis**: Encourage use of drug prophylaxis as initiated by a specialist.

- **Referral to Neurologist or Specialist**:
  - Uncertainty in diagnosis or presence of atypical symptoms.
  - Uncertainty in management of acute attacks.
  - Consideration of verapamil for preventative treatment.
  - Persistent symptoms despite optimal primary care management.
  - Need for treatment in pregnant individuals.
