## Summary of Lower Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) in Women

### Definition
- **Lower UTI**: Infection of the bladder (cystitis) due to bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract entering the urethra.

### Types of UTI
- **Uncomplicated UTI**: 
  - Involves typical uropathogens in non-pregnant women without anatomical abnormalities or comorbidities.
  - Usually self-limiting, resolving within days.
- **Recurrent UTI**: 
  - Defined as two or more episodes in 6 months or three or more in 1 year.
- **Catheter-associated UTI**: 
  - Occurs in women who are catheterized or have had a catheter in the past 48 hours.
- **Asymptomatic Bacteriuria**: 
  - Significant bacteria in the urine without UTI symptoms.

### Causative Pathogen
- **Escherichia coli**: Responsible for up to 77% of cases.

### Potential Complications
- Pyelonephritis (upper UTI)
- Renal abscess
- Acute kidney injury
- Urosepsis

### Diagnostic Considerations
- **In Women Under 65**: 
  - One or more key symptoms: dysuria, new nocturia, cloudy urine, or other urinary symptoms (frequency, urgency, suprapubic pain, or hematuria).
- **In Women Over 65 and/or with Catheter**: 
  - Isolated new-onset dysuria or two or more urinary/non-specific symptoms.

### Assessment
- **History**:
  - Onset, severity, evolution of symptoms, sexual history, risk factors for recurrent/complicated UTI, family history, pregnancy possibility, contraception, and treatments.
- **Examination**:
  - Vital signs, abdominal and possibly vulval/pelvic examination.
- **Tests**:
  - Pregnancy test, urine dipstick testing, urine culture, and susceptibility testing based on clinical presentation, age, and risk factors.

### Management
- **Urgent Care**: 
  - Hospital admission if serious complications are suspected or if unable to manage in primary care.
- **Antibiotic Treatment**: 
  - Immediate or delayed based on symptom severity, risk factors, previous culture results, and antibiotic history for suspected acute uncomplicated UTI.
- **Urinary Catheter**: 
  - Ideally removed or replaced before starting antibiotics.
- **Self-Care**: 
  - Advise on symptom relief measures and sources of information/support.
- **Monitoring**: 
  - Advise when to seek urgent medical review if symptoms worsen or do not improve.
- **Postmenopausal Women**: 
  - Consider prescribing topical vaginal oestrogen for recurrent UTI.
- **Recurrent UTI**: 
  - Consider single-dose or low-dose daily antibiotic prophylaxis and arrange follow-up within 6 months.
- **Specialist Referral**: 
  - For recurrent/persistent unexplained UTI, suspected underlying causes, or serious conditions needing investigation.
