## Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Summary

### Definition
- CKD is characterized by abnormalities in kidney function or structure lasting over 3 months, with health implications.

### Diagnosis Criteria (≥ 3 months)
- **Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)**: < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² on at least two occasions (90 days apart).
- **Markers of Kidney Damage**: 
  - Urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) > 3 mg/mmol
  - Urine sediment abnormalities
  - Electrolyte abnormalities due to tubular disorders
  - Histological abnormalities
  - Structural imaging abnormalities
  - History of kidney transplantation

### Classification
- Based on a combination of eGFR and ACR.

### Causes and Risk Factors
- Hypertension
- Diabetes Mellitus
- Cardiovascular Disease (CVD)
- Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)
- Nephrotoxic drugs
- Obstructive uropathy

### Complications
- Increased risk with disease progression:
  - AKI
  - Hypertension
  - CVD
  - Renal anemia
  - Renal mineral and bone disorder
  - End-stage renal disease (ESRD)
  - Increased all-cause mortality

### Suspected CKD Indicators
- Presence of risk factors
- Incidental finding of raised serum creatinine or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²
- Clinical features suggestive of CKD

### Initial Investigations
- Serum creatinine and eGFR
- Early morning urine sample for ACR
- Urine dipstick for hematuria
- BMI, blood pressure, serum HbA1c, and lipid profile for cardiovascular risk
- Renal tract ultrasound (if indicated)

### Monitoring if CKD Confirmed
- eGFR and urine ACR measurements
- Full blood count (to exclude renal anemia)
- Serum calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone tests (to exclude renal metabolic and bone disorders)

### Referral to Nephrology Specialist
- 5-year risk of renal replacement therapy > 5%
- Accelerated CKD progression
- Urinary ACR ≥ 70 mg/mmol (unless associated with diabetes)
- Urinary ACR ≥ 30 mg/mmol with persistent hematuria (after UTI exclusion)
- Uncontrolled hypertension
- Rare or genetic CKD causes
- Suspected renal artery stenosis
- Suspected CKD complications

### Primary Care Management
- Assess/manage risk factors and comorbidities
- Offer low-cost renin-angiotensin system antagonist (if appropriate)
- Offer atorvastatin and antiplatelet
- Consider sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor
- Provide information, advice, and support
- Ensure immunizations for influenza and pneumococcal disease
