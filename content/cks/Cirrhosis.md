## Cirrhosis Summary

- **Definition**: Progressive liver disease due to chronic inflammation (10â€“20 years).
- **Pathophysiology**: Distortion of normal liver structure with regenerative nodules and fibrosis; affects liver functions (synthetic, metabolic, excretory).

### Disease Stages
- **Compensated Cirrhosis**: 
  - Asymptomatic phase.
  - Liver functions are largely effective.
  
- **Decompensated Cirrhosis**: 
  - Symptomatic phase.
  - Complications: jaundice, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding.

### Risk Factors
- Increased alcohol intake.
- Hepatitis B and C infections.
- Obesity/type 2 diabetes (with NAFLD).
- Autoimmune liver disease.
- Hemochromatosis or Wilson's disease.
- Drug-induced liver injury.

### Complications
- Malnutrition and frailty.
- Osteoporosis.
- Infection and sepsis (e.g., spontaneous bacterial peritonitis).
- Jaundice.
- Ascites.
- Hepatic encephalopathy.
- Variceal bleeding.
- Acute kidney injury and hepatorenal syndrome.
- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

### Diagnosis
- **Suspicion Criteria**:
  - Risk factors present.
  - Non-specific symptoms: malaise, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, muscle wasting.
  - Symptoms of chronic liver disease: abnormal bruising, bleeding, itch.
  - Signs: hepatosplenomegaly, spider naevi, palmar erythema, jaundice, peripheral edema, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy.
  - Abnormal liver blood tests (may be normal in cirrhosis).

### Assessment
- **History**: Symptoms, timescale, severity, risk factors, comorbidities, medications, family history, impact on daily functioning.
- **Examination**: Signs of malnutrition, liver disease, complications.
- **Tests**: Liver blood tests, additional tests for underlying causes, transient elastography for confirmation.

### Referral Guidelines
- **Immediate Referral**:
  - Decompensated liver disease: hospital admission or referral to hepatologist/gastroenterologist.
  - Newly diagnosed cirrhosis post-imaging: referral to hepatologist/gastroenterologist.
  - Alcohol-related liver disease: referral to specialist alcohol services.
  - End-stage liver disease: referral to multidisciplinary palliative care team.

### Primary Care Management
- Advise on information, support, and driving safety.
- Ensure specialist follow-up for underlying liver disease and complications.
- Recommend lifestyle changes: alcohol reduction, weight loss, physical activity, smoking cessation.
- Assess malnutrition risk; refer to dietitian if needed.
- Assess osteoporosis risk and manage accordingly.
- Ensure vaccinations are current.
- Review medications concerning liver function.
- Assess for comorbidities and manage complications.
