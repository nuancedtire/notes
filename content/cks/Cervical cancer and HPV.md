- **Cervical Cancer Origin**: 
  - Almost all cases arise from the ecto- or endocervical mucosa in the cervical transformation zone.

- **Dysplasia Types**: 
  - Low-grade dysplasia (CIN1) usually regresses.
  - Can progress to high-grade dysplasia (CIN2 or CIN3).

- **Cervical Cancer Development**: 
  - Occurs when high-grade dysplastic lesions extend beyond the basement membrane of cervical epithelium.

- **Types of Cervical Cancer**: 
  - Squamous cell carcinoma
  - Adenocarcinoma

- **Main Cause**: 
  - Persistent infection with 15 high-risk subtypes of human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily through sexual intercourse.
  - HPV detected in 99% of cervical cancer cases; HPV 16 and 18 are responsible for at least two-thirds of cases.

- **HPV Infection Statistics**: 
  - Only 10% of HPV infections become persistent.
  - Time interval from HPV infection to development of precancerous lesions: 1–10 years.

- **Risk Factors**: 
  - Increased HPV exposure (e.g., early first intercourse).
  - Impaired immune response (e.g., solid organ transplant, HIV).

- **Incidence**: 
  - Peak rates in the UK: females aged 30–34 years.

- **Prognosis Factors**: 
  - FIGO stage of disease and age at diagnosis.

- **Complications**: 
  - Psychosocial issues 
  - Sexual dysfunction 
  - Early menopause and fertility loss 
  - Bladder and bowel dysfunction 
  - Pain, renal failure, hemorrhage, fistulae, lymphoedema.

- **Diagnosis Indicators**:
  - Abnormal vaginal bleeding/discharge not due to infection.
  - Pelvic pain and/or dyspareunia.
  - Postmenopausal bleeding not from HRT.
  - Abnormal cervix appearance on examination.
  - Symptoms of advanced disease (rare).

- **Management if Cervical Cancer is Suspected**:
  - Urgent referral to colposcopy/gynaecology oncology (2-week cancer pathway) for diagnosis confirmation, staging, and potential treatment.

- **Management of Confirmed Cervical Cancer**:
  - Provide information and support.
  - Consider HIV testing.
  - Advise cessation of smoking.
  - Discuss treatment adverse effects.
  - Assess/manage complications.
  - Monitor for recurrent disease symptoms.
  - Manage symptoms of advanced disease.

- **Prevention Strategies**:
  - Participate in national cervical screening program.
  - Participate in national HPV vaccination program.
  - Consistent condom use and safer sex practices.
