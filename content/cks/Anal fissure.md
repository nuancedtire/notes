## Anal Fissure Summary

### Definition
- Tear or ulcer in the anal canal lining
- Causes pain on defecation

### Classification
1. **Acute**: Present for less than 6 weeks
2. **Chronic**: Present for 6 weeks or longer
3. **Primary**: No clear underlying cause
4. **Secondary**: Clear underlying cause (e.g., constipation, inflammatory bowel disease, STIs, colorectal cancer)

### Epidemiology
- Common condition
- Peak incidence: Ages 15-40
- Rare in elderly; further investigation needed for underlying causes

### Clinical Features
- **Symptoms**: Anal pain with defecation (may include bright red rectal bleeding), anal spasm
- **External Examination**:
  - Acute: Superficial, well-demarcated linear split
  - Chronic: Wider, deeper with visible muscle fibers; swollen edges; possible skin tag

- **Location**:
  - Primary fissures: Usually posterior midline (10% anterior, especially in women)
  - Secondary fissures: Irregular outline, multiple, or lateral

### Diagnosis
- Referral for examination under anaesthesia if unclear diagnosis or pain/spasm complicates assessment

### Management
- **Referral**: Secondary care for suspected serious underlying causes (e.g., rectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease)
- **Dietary/Lifestyle Advice**: 
  - Ensure soft stools (high fiber, increased fluid intake)
  - Good anal hygiene to aid healing
- **Pain Management**:
  - Simple analgesia (paracetamol or ibuprofen)
  - Warm baths to reduce pain
  - Short course of topical anaesthetic for severe pain

- **Medication**:
  - Adults with persistent symptoms (1 week or more): Consider 6-8 week course of rectal glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) ointment
  - Manage underlying causes for secondary fissures or refer urgently if serious causes suspected

- **Follow-up**:
  - Adults with primary fissures: Review at 6-8 weeks (or sooner if needed)
  - Healed fissures: Continue dietary/lifestyle measures to prevent recurrence
  - Unhealed fissures despite adherence: Refer to general or colorectal surgeon
  - Children: Seek specialist advice if not healed after 2 weeks or with significant pain
