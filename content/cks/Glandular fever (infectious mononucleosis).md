- **Definition**: Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis) is primarily caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpes virus.

- **Contagiousness**: 
  - Not highly contagious.
  - Spread mainly through saliva (kissing, sharing utensils).
  - Can also spread via sexual contact, blood transfusions, organ transplants, and intrauterine transmission.
  - Contagious during the incubation period (4–7 weeks) and while symptoms are present; some may remain contagious for up to 18 months post-infection.

- **Epidemiology**: 
  - Most common in individuals aged 15–24 years.
  - Can occur in all ages.
  - Typically self-limiting, lasting 2–4 weeks; some cases may extend for months.

- **Complications**: 
  - Rare but serious complications include upper airway obstruction, splenic rupture, and neutropenia.
  - In immunocompromised individuals, EBV can lead to malignancies like Hodgkin's lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

- **Symptoms**: 
  - Common symptom: fatigue (lasting a few weeks to several months for some).
  - Suspected in cases with fever, lymphadenopathy, and sore throat.
  - In individuals over 40, may present atypically (e.g., prolonged unexplained fever, jaundice).

- **Diagnosis**: 
  - Full blood count (lymphocytosis, atypical lymphocytes).
  - Monospot test (heterophile antibodies) for immunocompetent adults.
  - EBV serology for children under 12 and immunocompromised individuals.

- **Differential Diagnosis**: 
  - Other causes of sore throat (e.g., streptococcal infection).
  - Other causes of lymphadenopathy (e.g., leukemia, lymphoma).
  - Viral infections with similar presentations (e.g., rubella, acute toxoplasmosis, mumps, HIV).

- **Management**: 
  - Symptomatic relief (paracetamol, ibuprofen).
  - Reassurance: condition is usually self-limiting; fatigue is common.
  - Encourage return to normal activities; exclusion from work/school not necessary.
  - Avoid heavy lifting and contact sports for the first month to reduce splenic rupture risk.
  - Advise on limiting disease spread (avoid kissing, not sharing utensils).
  - Hospital admission for suspected severe complications.
