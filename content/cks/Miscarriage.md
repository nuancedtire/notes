## Miscarriage Overview

- **Definition**: Spontaneous loss of pregnancy before fetal viability (before 24 weeks of gestation).
- **Recurrent Miscarriage**: Loss of three or more pregnancies before 24 weeks.

## Causes and Risk Factors

- **Common Cause**: Chromosomal abnormalities, particularly in the first trimester.
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Increasing parental age
  - Endocrine disorders (e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome)
  - Previous miscarriage

## Suspecting Miscarriage

- **Symptoms**: Vaginal bleeding (with or without pain) in a woman who is pregnant or has pregnancy symptoms (e.g., amenorrhoea, breast tenderness).
  
### Initial Steps if Miscarriage is Suspected

1. **Confirm Pregnancy**: Urine pregnancy test.
2. **Assessment**: Detailed history and examination to exclude differential diagnoses (e.g., ectopic pregnancy).
   - Ectopic pregnancy can occur without risk factors in about 30% of cases.
3. **Immediate Actions**:
   - **Hospital Admission**: If signs of haemodynamic instability or significant bleeding/pain.
   - **Referral**: To an early pregnancy assessment unit (EPAU) or out-of-hours gynaecology service for:
     - Abdominal pain/tenderness
     - Pelvic tenderness
     - Cervical motion tenderness

### Referral Criteria

- Women with:
  - Bleeding and one or more symptoms of early pregnancy complications.
  - Pain.
  - A pregnancy of 6 weeks gestation or more.
  - A pregnancy of uncertain gestation.

## Management Approaches

- **Expectant Management**: For pregnancies <6 weeks gestation with bleeding but no pain and no risk factors.
  - **Advice**:
    - Return if bleeding continues or pain develops.
    - Repeat urine pregnancy test after 7-10 days; return if positive.
    - A negative test indicates miscarriage.

- **Follow-Up**: Referral to EPAU or gynaecology service if symptoms worsen or if pregnancy viability is uncertain.

## Diagnostic Tools

- **Transvaginal Ultrasound**: First-line tool to assess pregnancy location and viability.

## Treatment Options in Secondary Care

- **Management Options**:
  - Expectant management (watchful waiting)
  - Medical management
  - Surgery

## Post-Miscarriage Follow-Up

- Women should be followed up in primary care and provided with support, information, and advice.
- Women with recurrent miscarriage should be referred for further investigation and management.
  - **Prognosis**: About 75% chance of successful future pregnancy if no cause is found, though prognosis decreases with increasing maternal age and number of previous miscarriages.
