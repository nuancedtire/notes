## Eating Disorders: Summary

### Main Types of Eating Disorders
- **Anorexia Nervosa**: 
  - Characterized by low body weight due to food intake restriction or behaviors that hinder weight gain.
  - Intense fear of gaining weight.
  
- **Bulimia Nervosa**: 
  - Involves recurrent binge eating of large amounts of food followed by compensatory behaviors (e.g., self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, excessive exercise).
  
- **Binge Eating Disorder**: 
  - Recurrent binge eating without compensatory behaviors.
  - Episodes marked by feelings of lack of control.
  
- **Atypical Eating Disorders**: 
  - Resemble anorexia, bulimia, or binge eating but do not meet full diagnostic criteria.
  
### Prevalence
- Atypical eating disorders are the most common, followed by binge eating disorders and bulimia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa is the least common.

### Complications Associated with Eating Disorders
- **Psychological Disturbance**: Anxiety and mood symptoms.
- **Social Difficulties**: Disrupted relationships and isolation.
- **Family/Carer Stress**.
- **Physical Abnormalities**: Issues with musculoskeletal, endocrine, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, haematological, and dental health.

### Diagnosis
- Based on personal history, clinical features, and corroboration from relatives or friends.
- Assessment may appear normal even in medically unstable individuals.

### Management in Primary Care
- **Emergency Admission Considerations**:
  - Severe physical health compromise (e.g., low BMI, cardiovascular instability).
  - Risk of refeeding syndrome.
  - Lack of home support.
  - Acute mental health risks (e.g., suicidal tendencies).

- **Referral**: 
  - All suspected cases should be referred to age-appropriate eating disorder services. 
  - Urgency depends on circumstances and clinical judgment.

- **Awaiting Assessment**:
  - Regular reviews to monitor physical and mental health risks.
  - Seek specialist advice for co-morbidities (e.g., diabetes) and pregnant women.
  - Consider the impact of malnutrition on medication effectiveness.

### Management of Confirmed Eating Disorders
