## Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) Summary

### Definition
- **Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)**: A neurological disorder with an irresistible urge to move limbs (primarily legs) and uncomfortable sensations.

### Symptoms
- **Timing**: Symptoms worsen in the evenings and often lead to sleep disturbances.
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Urge to move legs, often due to unpleasant sensations.
  - Symptoms worsen during rest/inactivity (lying down or sitting).
  - Relief from symptoms occurs with movement (walking/stretching).
  - Symptoms primarily present or worsen in the evening/night.
  - Not primarily due to another medical/behavioral condition (e.g., leg cramps).

### Pathophysiology
- Not fully understood; likely involves dysfunction of the **dopaminergic system**.
- RLS can be **idiopathic** or secondary to conditions like:
  - Pregnancy
  - Iron deficiency
  - Stage 5 chronic kidney disease
- Can also be caused by certain medications (e.g., antidepressants, antipsychotics, lithium).

### Diagnosis Criteria
- All criteria must be met for an RLS diagnosis:
  - Urge to move legs with unpleasant sensations.
  - Symptoms worsen during rest/inactivity.
  - Symptoms relieved by movement.
  - Symptoms worsen or occur during evening/night.
  - Not primarily caused by another condition.

### Differential Diagnoses
- Nocturnal leg cramps
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Akathisia
- Intermittent claudication

### Investigations
- No specific test for idiopathic RLS; consider:
  - **Serum ferritin** (to check iron deficiency).
  - Other tests based on history/examination (renal function, full blood count, thyroid function, blood glucose, vitamin B12).

### Management
- **Address underlying causes** to potentially resolve symptoms.
- **Self-Help Advice**:
  - Preventive measures: good sleep hygiene, reduce caffeine/alcohol, stop smoking, moderate regular exercise.
  - Relief strategies: walking/stretching, heat application, relaxation exercises, mental distraction, limb massage.
  
- **Treatment Options**:
  - **Mild symptoms**: Explanation, reassurance, self-help measures.
  - **Moderate to Severe symptoms**: 
    - Non-ergot dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine).
    - Alpha-2-delta ligands (pregabalin, gabapentin - off-label).
    - Weak opioids (e.g., codeine) for painful symptoms.
    - Short/intermittent hypnotic drugs (Z-drugs) for significant sleep disturbance.
  
- **Referral**: Consider referral to a neurologist or sleep specialist if diagnosis is uncertain or treatment fails.
