## Anogenital Warts (Condylomata Acuminata) Overview

- **Definition**: Benign, proliferative growths in genital, perineal, anal, and perianal areas.
- **Cause**: Human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily low-risk genotypes 6 and 11.

## Epidemiology

- **New Cases**: 50,691 newly diagnosed cases in England (2019) - ~10% of all new STIs.
- **Trends**: 14% decrease in cases from 2017 to 2019.
- **Peak Age**: 20â€“24 years.
- **Transmission**: Primarily sexual contact; rare peri-natal transmission or from hand warts.

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical Examination**:
  - Lesions: Single/multiple, high friction areas.
  - Characteristics: 
    - Firm and keratinized on dry, hairy skin.
    - Soft and non-keratinized on warm, moist, non-hairy skin.
    - May be broad-based or pedunculated; some pigmented.

- **Assessment**:
  - Brief sexual history (risk of co-existing STIs).
  - Symptoms inquiry.
  - Examination of external genitalia and extra-genital sites.
  - **Biopsy**: Not usually performed unless lesions are atypical.

- **Differential Diagnosis**:
  - Pearly penile papules.
  - Benign molluscum contagiosum, skin tags, seborrhoeic keratoses.
  - Vulval, penile, or anal intraepithelial neoplasia, malignancy.
  - Anogenital condylomata lata of secondary syphilis.

## Referral Guidelines

- **Recommended for**:
  - Pregnant women.
  - Children (consider sexual abuse).
  - Immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV).

- **Essential if**:
  - Diagnosis is uncertain.
  - Suspected malignancy or intraepithelial neoplasia.
  - Warts are cervical, intrameatal, or intra-anal.

## Treatment Options

- **Primary Care Treatment** (if referral declined/unavailable and diagnosis is certain):
  - **No treatment**: ~1/3 of visible warts resolve spontaneously in 6 months.
  - **Self-applied Treatments**:
    - Podophyllotoxin 0.5% solution or 0.15% cream.
    - Imiquimod 5% cream.
    - Sinecatechins 10% ointment.
  - **Ablative Methods** (only if practitioner is trained):
    - Cryotherapy, excision, electrocautery.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Patient Education**: Explain condition and treatment options.
- **Cervical Screening**: No change in screening intervals for cervical cytology recommended.
- **Condom Use**: Advise during sexual intercourse.
- **Smoking Cessation**: Advise if relevant to improve treatment response.
- **Partner Assessment**: Current sexual partner may need evaluation for undetected genital warts or STIs.
