## Parkinson's Disease Summary

### Overview
- **Definition**: Chronic, progressive neurodegenerative condition due to loss of dopamine-containing cells in the substantia nigra.
- **Parkinsonism**: Clinical syndrome with bradykinesia and at least one of tremor, rigidity, or postural instability.
- **Commonality**: Most common form of parkinsonism.
- **Presentation**: Initially unilateral, may progress to bilateral features.

### Causes of Parkinsonism
- Drug-induced
- Cerebrovascular disease
- Lewy body dementia
- Multiple system atrophy
- Progressive supranuclear palsy

### Prevalence and Prognosis
- Increases with age.
- Typically slow progression; variable prognosis.
- Mortality rate: 2–5 times higher in elderly with Parkinson’s compared to age-matched controls.
- Early-onset disease may delay motor complications and cognitive impairment.

### Complications
- **Motor**: 
  - Immobility
  - Slowness
  - Freezing of gait
  - Falls
  - Motor fluctuations
  - Dyskinesia
  - Communication difficulties
- **Non-motor**: 
  - Depression
  - Anxiety
  - Impulse control disorders
  - Psychotic symptoms
  - Dementia
  - Sleep disturbances
  - Constipation
  - Orthostatic hypotension
  - Pain

### Diagnosis and Referral
- Urgent referral to a movement disorder specialist for suspected cases.
- Review any drug-induced parkinsonism and adjust medications as necessary.
- Do not delay referral for response assessment.

### Management
- **Multidisciplinary Team**: Involves a Parkinson's disease nurse specialist for symptom management.
- **Primary Care**:
  - Provide information and support to patients and caregivers.
  - Refer to multidisciplinary services (e.g., speech therapy, physiotherapy).
  - Advise patients to inform DVLA and car insurers upon diagnosis or condition change.
  - Adjust anti-parkinsonian medications only with specialist guidance.
  - Avoid sudden cessation of anti-parkinsonian medications.
  - Coordinate with specialist team for worsening symptoms.
  - Manage co-morbidities and be cautious with exacerbating drugs.
  - Discuss prognosis, advance care planning, and end-of-life issues; refer to palliative care as needed.
