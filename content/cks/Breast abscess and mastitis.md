## Mastitis and Breast Abscess Summary

### Definitions
- **Mastitis**: Painful inflammatory condition of the breast, may or may not involve infection.
  - **Lactational (Puerperal) Mastitis**: Occurs in lactating women, primarily due to milk stasis.
  - **Non-Lactational Mastitis**: Occurs in non-lactating women, often with infection.

- **Breast Abscess**: Localized collection of pus in the breast; a severe complication of mastitis.

### Complications of Mastitis
- Sepsis
- Scarring
- Recurrent mastitis

### Causes
- **Lactating Women**: 
  - Primary cause: Milk stasis leading to inflammatory response.
  - Common organism: *Staphylococcus aureus*.

- **Non-Lactating Women**:
  - Infection types:
    - **Central/Subareolar**: Usually secondary to periductal mastitis.
    - **Peripheral**: Associated with conditions like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, trauma, corticosteroid treatment, or granulomatous mastitis.
  - Common organisms: *Staphylococcus aureus*, enterococci, anaerobic bacteria (e.g., *Bacteroides*, anaerobic streptococci).

### Symptoms Suggesting Mastitis
- Painful breast.
- Fever and/or general malaise.
- Tender, red, swollen, and hard area of the breast (often wedge-shaped).

### Indicators of Infection
- Presence of nipple fissure.
- Symptoms worsening after 12â€“24 hours despite milk removal.
- Positive bacterial culture in breast milk.

### Symptoms Suggesting Breast Abscess
- History of recent mastitis.
- Painful, swollen lump in the breast; redness, heat, swelling of skin.
- Fever and/or general malaise.

### Management
- **If Breast Abscess is Suspected**: 
  - Urgent referral to general surgeon for diagnosis and management.
  - Urgent 2-week wait referral if breast cancer is suspected.

- **First-Line Management for Mastitis**:
  - Reassurance of normal breast return post-treatment.
  - Pain relief measures (simple analgesics, warm compress).
  - Encourage continued breastfeeding, including from affected breast.
  - Identify/manage predisposing factors (poor infant attachment, nipple damage, smoking, breast abnormalities).
  - Prescribe oral antibiotics if indicated.
  - Provide advice on prevention of recurrence (good breastfeeding technique, hygiene).
