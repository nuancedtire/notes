## Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) - Summary

### Definition
- AMD refers to changes in the macula, occurring in individuals aged 50 and over, without obvious precipitating causes.

### Key Changes in AMD
1. **Drusen**: Lipid material accumulations beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and within Bruchâ€™s membrane.
2. **RPE Abnormalities**: Areas of hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation.
3. **Geographic Atrophy**: Breakdown of light-sensitive macular cells, leading to sharply demarcated areas of depigmentation that may enlarge over time.
4. **Neovascular (Exudative) AMD**: Development of abnormal new blood vessels in the choroid that can bleed or leak, causing distortion and scarring.

### Classification
- **Early AMD**: Low, medium, or high risk of progression.
- **Late AMD**: Intermediate, wet active, dry, or wet inactive.

### Impact
- Common cause of severe visual impairment in older adults in developed countries.

### Risk Factors
- Unknown cause; established risks include:
  - Older age
  - Smoking
  - Family history
  - Genetic factors

### Complications
- Visual impairment and blindness
- Visual hallucinations
- Depression
- Falls and fractures
- Reduced quality of life

### Symptoms
- Distortion of vision (straight lines appear crooked)
- Painless loss or blurring of central vision
- Black or grey patch in the central vision (scotoma)
- Difficulty reading, driving, or seeing fine details
- Flickering or flashing lights (photopsia)
- Difficulty adjusting to lighting changes
- Visual hallucinations (in severe cases)

### Examination
- Visual acuity may be normal or reduced.
- Urgent referral to an ophthalmologist if AMD is suspected, ideally within a week.

### Management
- In secondary care, neovascular AMD is treated with intraocular injections of anti-angiogenic drugs.
