## Stroke and TIA Summary

### Definitions
- **Stroke**: Clinical syndrome of vascular origin with rapidly developing focal/global cerebral disturbances lasting >24 hours or leading to death.
- **Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA)**: Transient neurological dysfunction (<24 hours) due to focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia without acute infarction evidence.

### Statistics
- **Types of Strokes**: 
  - Ischaemic: ~85%
  - Haemorrhagic: ~15%
- **Incidence in the UK**:
  - Approximately 100,000 strokes annually.
  - In 2016, about 57,000 first strokes in England.
  - First-ever TIA affects ~50 per 100,000 people/year.
- **Risks**: High risk of further vascular events post-stroke/TIA.
- **Mortality**: Stroke is a leading cause of death/disability, causing ~38,000 deaths/year in the UK.

### Complications
- Neurological problems
- Depression and anxiety
- Communication difficulties
- Challenges with daily living activities

### Clinical Presentation
- **Stroke/TIA Symptoms**: Sudden onset focal neurological symptoms (numbness, weakness, slurred speech, visual disturbances) not explained by other conditions (e.g., hypoglycaemia).
- **Cerebral Hypoperfusion**: May present as non-focal/global deficits.
- **TIA Suspicion**: Sudden onset focal neurological deficit resolved within 24 hours.
- **Stroke Suspicion**: Sudden onset focal neurological deficit persisting >24 hours.

### Management
#### Suspected Acute Stroke (or Emergent TIA) in Primary Care
1. Immediate emergency admission to a stroke unit.
2. Provide advance information to ambulance and hospital.
3. Avoid antiplatelet treatment until haemorrhagic stroke is excluded.

#### Follow-Up Post-Stroke
- Arrange follow-up on discharge, at 6 months, then annually to:
  - Assess need for specialist review.
  - Evaluate social and healthcare needs of the patient and family/carer.
  - Optimize lifestyle and drug treatments for secondary prevention.

#### Management of Suspected TIA
1. Administer aspirin 300 mg immediately (unless contraindicated or already on aspirin).
2. Arrange specialist assessment within 24 hours if TIA occurred within the last week.
3. Refer for specialist assessment within 7 days if TIA occurred >1 week ago.
4. Advise against driving until specialist guidance is given.

#### Follow-Up Post-TIA
- Arrange follow-up to optimize secondary prevention through lifestyle and drug strategies.
