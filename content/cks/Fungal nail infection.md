## Fungal Nail Infection (Onychomycosis) Summary

### Overview
- Involves any part of the nail unit: nail plate, nail bed, root.
- Symptoms: discolouration, distortion, thickening.
- Toenails are 7x more likely to be affected than fingernails.
- Caused by dermatophytes (90% of cases) and non-dermatophyte moulds/yeasts (e.g., Candida).

### Demographics
- More common in older adults and athletes; rare in children.

### Risk Factors
- Concomitant fungal skin infection.
- Psoriasis.
- Diabetes mellitus.
- Peripheral arterial disease.
- Immunocompromised states.
- Repeated nail trauma.
- Occlusive footwear.

### Signs of Infection
- Abnormal, discoloured nails.
- White/yellow streaks on one side.
- Thickened nails; white/yellow spots; complete destruction.
- Associated paronychia (may indicate Candida).

### Assessment
1. **Symptoms Inquiry**: Pain, discomfort, footwear issues, psychosocial impact, co-morbidities, family history.
2. **Classification**: Type of onychomycosis, if possible.
3. **Examination**: Check for fungal skin infections elsewhere.
4. **Diagnostics**: Nail clippings/scrapings for fungal microscopy and culture.

### Initial Management
- **Self-care**: Keep nails short, wear non-occlusive footwear, treat tinea pedis.
- **Topical Antifungal**: Amorolfine nail lacquer for early, limited, or superficial infections.
- **Oral Antifungal**:
  - Terbinafine for dermatophyte infections.
  - Itraconazole or fluconazole (off-label) for Candida/non-dermatophyte infections.

### Follow-up
- Assess nail regrowth 3â€“6 months post-treatment.
- If treatment fails, consider:
  - Managing underlying causes.
  - Re-sampling for diagnostics.
  - Combination therapy (topical + oral).
  
### Referral Considerations
- **To Podiatrist**:
  - Thickened toenails causing discomfort.
  - Nail trauma from footwear.
  - Deformed toenails traumatizing adjacent toes.

- **To Dermatologist**:
  - Oral antifungal for children.
  - Uncertain diagnosis.
  - Unsuccessful primary care treatment.
  - Co-existing nail diseases (e.g., psoriasis, lichen planus).
  - Immunocompromised individuals (based on clinical judgment).
