- **Tendinopathy**: Pain, swelling, and impaired function of a tendon.
  
- **Achilles Tendon**: 
  - Thickest and strongest tendon in the body.
  - Composed of fibres from the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles.
  
- **Pathology**: 
  - Common in active individuals.
  - Complications include:
    - Tendon rupture.
    - Negative impact on work and daily activities.
    - Limitations in sporting activities.
  
- **Symptoms and Signs**:
  - Aching (sometimes sharp) pain in the heel, aggravated by activity or pressure.
  - Stiffness in the tendon (morning or after prolonged sitting).
  - Tenderness, swelling, and crepitus along the tendon.
  
- **Assessment**:
  - Same-day assessment by an orthopaedic specialist if tendon rupture is suspected.
  
- **Management in Primary Care**:
  - Identify and manage underlying causes (e.g., discontinue fluoroquinolone antibiotics).
  - Advise use of cold packs or ice after acute injury.
  - Provide simple analgesia (e.g., paracetamol) for pain relief.
  - Recommend rest (reduce or stop precipitating activity); exercise can resume when pain allows.
