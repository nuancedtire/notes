## Gastroenteritis Summary

### Definition
- **Gastroenteritis**: Transient disorder from enteric infection, usually viral, characterized by sudden onset of diarrhea (with or without vomiting).
- **Food Poisoning**: Illness from contaminated food/water (bacteria, toxins, parasites, viruses, chemicals).
- **Acute Diarrhea**: Three or more episodes of liquid/semi-liquid stool in 24 hours, lasting less than 14 days.
- **Prolonged Diarrhea**: Acute-onset diarrhea lasting over 14 days.

### Characteristics
- Most infectious diarrhea is self-limiting.
- **Transmission Routes**: 
  - Faecal-oral
  - Foodborne
  - Environmental
  - Airborne

### Factors Affecting Infection
- Underlying pathogen
- Age and co-morbidities
- Immune status
- Environmental factors

### Complications
- Dehydration
- Electrolyte disturbance
- Acute kidney injury
- Sepsis
- Haemolytic uraemic syndrome
- Secondary irritable syndrome or inflammatory bowel syndrome

### Assessment
1. **Symptoms to inquire**:
   - Diarrhea (blood, mucus, pus)
   - Nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, malaise
   - Onset, frequency, duration of symptoms
   - Risk factors for dehydration
   - Fluid/food intake and urinary output
   - Recent food intake
   - Exposure to affected cases/outbreaks
   - Recent travel or hospital admission
   - Recent drug treatment

2. **Examination**:
   - Clinical features of dehydration or shock
   - Abdominal examination
   - Signs of complications or alternative diagnosis

3. **Stool Testing**: 
   - Arrange if indicated (systemically unwell, possible dysentery, prolonged diarrhea, travel to at-risk areas, contact with affected persons).

### Management
- **Emergency**: Hospital admission or assessment as needed.
- **Consultation**: Liaise with microbiologist or communicable disease consultant if necessary.
- **Information & Support**: Provide sources for monitoring fluid intake/preventing/treating dehydration (ORS solution).
- **Medications**: Antibiotics, anti-diarrhoeals, anti-emetics, probiotics not routinely recommended.
- **Infection Prevention**: Hygiene, environmental cleaning, exclusion from childcare/work/social settings.
- **Follow-up**: Advise on when to seek urgent medical advice.
- **Notification**: Inform local health protection team of suspected notifiable diseases/organisms.
- **Specific Management**: Arrange appropriate management if a specific microbiological cause is confirmed (antibiotic treatment and/or stool testing for clearance).
