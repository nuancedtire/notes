## Infective Conjunctivitis - Summary

### Definition
- Inflammation of the conjunctiva due to viral, bacterial, or parasitic infection.

### Types
- **Viral Conjunctivitis**: Most common, primarily caused by adenoviruses.
- **Bacterial Conjunctivitis**: Commonly caused by:
  - *Streptococcus pneumoniae*
  - *Staphylococcus aureus*
  - *Haemophilus influenzae*
- **Hyperacute Conjunctivitis**: Rapidly developing, severe, typically caused by *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*.
- **Ophthalmia Neonatorum (ON)**: Occurs in the first four weeks of life, can be infectious or non-infectious.
- **Acute Conjunctivitis**: Usually self-limiting, rarely causes vision loss.

### Duration of Conditions
- **Viral Conjunctivitis**: Resolves within 7 days.
- **Bacterial Conjunctivitis**: Resolves within 5 to 10 days.
- **Epidemic Keratoconjunctivitis**: Can lead to visual loss and light sensitivity.

### Risk Factors
- Contact lens wearers and immunocompromised individuals are at greater risk for complications such as keratitis.
- Most ON cases are mild; untreated infections can cause serious complications (e.g., sight loss, death).

### Assessment
- Serious causes (e.g., acute glaucoma, keratitis, iritis, trauma) must be excluded when presenting with red eye.
- Differentiating between viral and bacterial conjunctivitis clinically is challenging.

### Clinical Features
- Conjunctival erythema.
- Discomfort (grittiness, foreign body sensation, burning).
- Watering and discharge, possibly leading to transient vision blurring; purulent or mucopurulent discharge may cause eyelids to stick together upon waking.

### Investigations
- Swabs are not routinely taken but may be appropriate if:
  - No need for referral to ophthalmology.
  - Failed response to initial treatment.

### Urgent Referral Criteria
- Red flag symptoms indicating serious causes.
- Ophthalmia neonatorum.
- Suspected gonococcal or chlamydial conjunctivitis.
- Possible herpes infection.
- Suspected periorbital/orbital cellulitis.
- Severe disease (e.g., corneal ulceration).
- Recent intraocular surgery history.
- Conjunctivitis with severe systemic conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, immunocompromise).
- Corneal involvement with soft contact lens use.

### Management in Primary Care
- Reassure patients that most cases are self-limiting.
- Provide patient information.
- Advise self-care measures:
  - Bathing/cleaning eyelids.
  - Cool compresses.
  - Lubricating drops or artificial tears.
  - Avoidance of contact lenses.
- Advise on infection control techniques.
- Use topical antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol or fusidic acid) if bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected; a delayed treatment strategy may be appropriate.
- Follow up and safety-net for red flag features indicating the need for urgent review.
