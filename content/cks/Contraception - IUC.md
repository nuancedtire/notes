  - Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs)
  - Duration of use: 3 to 10 years

- **Types of IUC in the UK**
  - Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs)
  - Copper intrauterine devices (Cu-IUDs)
  - Cu-IUDs: Minimum copper surface area of 300 mm²
  - LNG-IUDs: Available in 52 mg, 19.5 mg, 13.5 mg of levonorgestrel (LNG)

- **Effectiveness**
  - Very high contraceptive effectiveness
  - Not affected by enzyme-inducing drugs or body weight/BMI
  - Failure rates:
    - Cu-IUDs: 0.6%–0.8% (first year)
    - 52 mg LNG-IUD: 0.2% (first year)
    - 13.5 mg & 19.5 mg LNG-IUDs: 0.3% (during licensed use)

- **Mode of Action**
  - **LNG-IUDs**: 
    - Progestogenic effects on endometrium and cervical mucus
    - Prevents sperm passage; may inhibit implantation of fertilized ovum
  - **Cu-IUDs**: 
    - Inhibition of fertilization via copper effects on ovum and sperm

- **Risks and Adverse Effects**
  - Pain on insertion
  - Device expulsion
  - Unscheduled bleeding
  - Uterine perforation
  - Infection (e.g., pelvic inflammatory disease)
  - Ectopic pregnancy
  - Hormonal adverse effects (LNG-IUD): acne, ovarian cysts

- **Insertion Guidelines**
  - Must be performed by trained healthcare professionals
  - Full medical history to assess suitability
  - UK Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (UKMEC) for safe prescribing
  - Full sexual history to evaluate risk of STIs
  - STI testing/cervical screening offered as appropriate
  - Provide detailed information on IUD and insertion procedure for informed decision-making
  - Bimanual pelvic examination prior to insertion to assess uterus
  - Exclude pregnancy before IUD insertion
