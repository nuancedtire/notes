## Vestibular Neuronitis Summary

### Definition
- Disorder characterized by:
  - Acute, isolated, spontaneous, prolonged vertigo of peripheral origin.
  
### Terminology
- **Vestibular Neuronitis**: Inflammation of the vestibular nerve, often post-viral infection.
- **Labyrinthitis**: Involves inflammation of the labyrinth; includes hearing loss (not present in vestibular neuronitis).

### Symptoms
- **Initial Symptoms**: 
  - Severe vertigo lasting 2–3 days.
  - Nausea, vomiting, unsteadiness.
- **Absence of**: 
  - Hearing loss and tinnitus.
  - Focal neurological symptoms.

### Signs
- **Nystagmus**: 
  - Typically fine horizontal; may be mixed horizontal-torsional.
  - Beats in the same direction regardless of head rotation; reduced with fixed gaze.
- **Head Impulse Test**: May be positive (also positive in other peripheral vertigo causes).

### Differential Diagnosis
- Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
- Labyrinthitis
- Meniere’s Disease
- Central Causes (e.g., migraine, stroke, cerebellar tumor, multiple sclerosis)

### Management
- **Activity Resumption**: Advise resuming activity as soon as possible; address safety concerns (driving, work, fall prevention).
- **Medications**:
  - Severe symptoms: Short-term symptomatic treatment (buccal/intramuscular prochlorperazine or cyclizine).
  - Less severe symptoms: Oral prochlorperazine, cinnarizine, cyclizine, or promethazine teoclate.
- **Severe Nausea/Vomiting**: If unable to tolerate oral fluids or treatment, consider hospital admission.

### Referral Criteria
- Atypical symptoms (e.g., additional neurological symptoms).
- Symptoms not improving after 1 week of treatment.
- Persistent symptoms beyond 6 weeks.
