- **Vaginal Discharge Overview**
  - **Physiological (Normal) Discharge**
    - Characteristics: White or clear, mucus-like, non-offensive
    - Variability: Changes with menstrual cycle and reproductive stages
  
  - **Pathological (Abnormal) Discharge**
    - Characteristics: Change in color, consistency, volume, and/or odor
    - Symptoms: Itch, soreness, dysuria, pelvic pain, intermenstrual/post-coital bleeding

- **Causes of Abnormal Vaginal Discharge**
  - **Infective Causes**
    - Non-sexually transmitted: Bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis
    - Sexually transmitted: Chlamydia, gonorrhoea
  - **Non-infective Causes**
    - Retained foreign body, dermatitis, gynaecological cancer

- **Assessment and Examination**
  - Detailed history taking is essential
  - Examination recommended for most women with abnormal discharge
  - May omit examination if:
    - History indicates bacterial vaginosis or vulvovaginal candidiasis
    - Low risk of STI
    - No symptoms of upper genital tract infection (abnormal bleeding, deep dyspareunia, pelvic/abdominal pain, fever)

- **STI Testing**
  - Offer testing for:
    - Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomoniasis, HIV, syphilis
  - Ideal setting: Genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic for treatment and partner notification
  - Alternative: Primary care if GUM clinic attendance is not possible

- **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Consideration**
  - Consider in women under 25 with:
    - Recent onset bilateral lower abdominal pain
    - Local tenderness on bimanual examination
    - Excluded pregnancy
  - Low threshold for empirical treatment to prevent long-term complications (ectopic pregnancy, infertility, pelvic pain)

- **Management Strategies**
  - Treat infective and non-infective causes where possible
  - Reassure women with physiological discharge features; provide general healthcare advice (personal hygiene)
  - Consider need for admission/referral:
    - Urgent hospital admission for pregnant women with PID or severe symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fever > 38Â°C)
    - Referral for suspected gynaecological cancer
    - Strong recommendation for GUM clinic referral for confirmed STIs (facilitate treatment and partner notification)
    - Referral to GUM clinic for persistent/recurrent symptoms or unclear cause of discharge
