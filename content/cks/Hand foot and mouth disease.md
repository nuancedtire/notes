## Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) Summary

- **Definition**: HFMD is an acute viral illness marked by:
  - Vesicular eruptions in the mouth
  - Papulovesicular lesions on distal limbs
- **Distinction**: Not to be confused with foot and mouth disease in animals.

### Etiology
- **Common Causes**:
  - Coxsackie A16 virus (most frequent)
  - Other group A and B Coxsackie viruses
  - Enterovirus 71 (less common but more serious)
- **Atypical HFMD**:
  - Caused by Coxsackie A6
  - Presents with extensive skin disease, nail shedding, and higher adult infection risk.

### Epidemiology
- **Outbreaks**: Common in:
  - Nurseries
  - Childcare centers
  - Schools
- **Transmission**: Commonly spreads within families; most adults are immune due to childhood exposure.

### Complications
- **Rare** but may include:
  - Dehydration (most common due to oral pain)
  - Secondary bacterial infections of lesions
  - Serious neurological complications (e.g., encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis)

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Based on symptoms and signs.
- **Early Symptoms**:
  - Fever (38–39°C)
  - Malaise
  - Loss of appetite
  - Cough
  - Abdominal pain
  - Sore mouth
- **Oral Lesions**: Scattered ulcerative lesions develop within 1–2 days.
- **Skin Lesions**: Macules and papules on hands and feet develop shortly after oral lesions, commonly affecting:
  - Sides of fingers
  - Dorsum of hands
  - Margins of heels

### Management
- **Supportive Care**:
  - Encourage fluid intake and soft diet if oral pain exists
  - Pain relief with paracetamol or ibuprofen
- **Infection Control**:
  - Advise on general hygiene measures
  - Exclusion from nursery/school is not necessary unless the child is too unwell
- **Advice for Pregnant Women**:
  - Avoid close contact with infected individuals
  - Follow precautions, especially around delivery; seek specialist advice if delivery is within 3 weeks.
