## Temporomandibular Disorders (TMDs) Summary

### Definition
- TMDs are musculoskeletal conditions affecting:
  - Masticatory muscles
  - Temporomandibular joint (TMJ)
  - Associated structures

### Clinical Features
- Common symptoms include:
  - Pain in TMJ and surrounding areas
  - Headaches
  - Limitations in jaw movement
  - Sounds from the TMJ (clicking, popping, crepitus)

### Pain Categories
1. **Myogenous** (muscle-related)
2. **Arthrogenous** (joint-related)
3. **Headache** (temporal region, exacerbated by jaw function)

### Duration of Symptoms
- **Acute TMD Pain**: 
  - Short duration
  - Self-limiting
  - Related to a specific event (e.g., dental treatment, trauma)
  
- **Chronic TMD Pain**: 
  - Lasting over 3 months

### Clinical Features to Suspect TMD
- Pain in TMJ/masticatory muscles (may radiate to head/neck)
- Pain upon palpation of TMJ, masseter, or temporalis muscles
- Pain worsened by jaw movement
- Reproducible joint noise with jaw movements
- Temporal headaches exacerbated by jaw function
- Reproducible otalgia (ear pain) without ear disease

### Referral Criteria for Specialist Management
- History of trauma/fracture to TMJ
- Markedly limited mouth opening (closed lock)
- Pain/reduced jaw function with known rheumatic joint disease
- Recurrent TMJ dislocation/associated syndromes
- Persistent symptoms despite 6-8 weeks of treatment
- Worsening symptoms
- Persistent inability to manage a normal diet
- Severe pain/dysfunction unresponsive to conservative measures
- Uncertain diagnosis
- Other chronic pain-related comorbidities

### Management Approach
- **Biopsychosocial Approach** for suspected TMD:
  - **Education**: Reassurance that TMD is usually non-progressive; symptoms should improve.
  - **Self-Management**:
    - Soft diet
    - Rest the jaw during acute pain
    - Avoid parafunctional activities
    - Apply covered ice/warm flannel or heat pad
    - Massage affected muscles
  - **Lifestyle Strategies**: Reinforce positive strategies.
  - **Medications**:
    - Paracetamol or NSAIDs
    - Consider amitriptyline, gabapentin, or short-term diazepam if appropriate
  - **Referrals**:
    - Dental professional, physiotherapy, acupuncture as needed
    - Additional services for dental assessment, cognitive behavioral therapy, or physiotherapy based on clinical judgment
