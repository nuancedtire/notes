## Leg Cramps: Summary

- **Definition**: 
  - Sudden, involuntary, painful muscle contraction.
  - Typically occurs in the posterior calf; can involve foot or thigh.

- **Prevalence**: 
  - Commonly occurs at night (nocturnal leg cramps).
  - More prevalent in older adults.

- **Etiology**: 
  - Most cases are idiopathic.
  - Can be associated with various underlying conditions.

- **Idiopathic Leg Cramps Characteristics**:
  - History of sudden, intense calf or foot pain (thigh pain is rare).
  - Visible or palpable muscle knotting or abnormal posture.
  - Pain usually lasts seconds to less than 10 minutes.
  - Involves a single muscle (or part of muscle).
  - No abnormal findings on physical examination.
  - Good response to passive and active stretching.
  - Residual tenderness in the affected muscle.
  - Causes sleep disruption.

- **Differential Diagnosis**:
  - Exclude secondary causes: 
    - Lower motor neuron issues, metabolic problems, medications, pregnancy.
  - Conditions that mimic leg cramps: 
    - Claudication, restless legs syndrome, myalgia and myositis, Bakerâ€™s cyst, deep vein thrombosis, dystonia, myoclonus.

- **Investigations**: 
  - Generally unnecessary unless cramps have atypical features or an underlying cause is suspected.

- **Management of Idiopathic Leg Cramps**:
  - **Reassurance**: Common, no underlying cause, may resolve on its own.
  - **Self-Care Measures**:
    - Stretching and massaging affected muscles to relieve or reduce frequency.
    - Providing written self-care advice.
    - Use of analgesia post-cramp if muscle is tender.
  - **Quinine**: 
    - Generally not recommended due to poor benefit-to-risk ratio.
    - Considered only if self-care fails and quality of life is affected.
  - **Hospital Admission**: 
    - If cramps are severe with concerning symptoms (e.g., anuria, altered consciousness, temperature abnormalities).
  - **Referral**: 
    - To appropriate specialty (neurology, rheumatology) if underlying cause suspected.
    - Consider referral if:
      - Diagnosis is uncertain.
      - Primary care treatment fails and symptoms impact quality of life.
