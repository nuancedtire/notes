## Falls - Risk Assessment: Summary

- **Definition of a Fall**: An event causing a person to unintentionally rest on the ground or lower level.
- **Simple Falls**: Result from chronic impairments (cognition, vision, balance, mobility), not acute medical issues (e.g., arrhythmia, TIA, vertigo).

### Prevalence and Risk Factors
- **Common in Older Adults**: Especially those aged 65+; prevalence increases with age.
- **Key Risk Factors**:
  - **History of Falls**: Strongest predictor; routine inquiry recommended for older adults in healthcare.
  - **Mobility/Balance Conditions**: Includes arthritis, diabetes, incontinence, stroke, syncope, Parkinson's disease.
  - **Additional Health Issues**: Muscle weakness, poor balance, visual/cognitive impairment, depression, alcohol misuse.
  - **Polypharmacy**: Use of psychoactive drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) or postural hypotension-causing drugs (e.g., antihypertensives).
  - **Home Hazards**: Loose rugs/mats, poor lighting, wet surfaces, loose fittings (e.g., handrails).

### Consequences of Falls
- **Injury Rates**: 40–60% result in significant injuries (lacerations, traumatic brain injuries, fractures).
- **Other Complications**: Distress, pain, loss of self-confidence, reduced quality of life, loss of independence, mortality.

### Assessment and Intervention
- **Assessment Recommendations**:
  - Older individuals seeking medical attention for falls, reporting recurrent falls, or showing risk factors should be assessed for gait and balance (e.g., Timed Up & Go test, Turn 180° test).
  - Multifactorial risk assessment by a skilled clinician for those with falls in the past year or gait/balance abnormalities.
  
- **Assessment Components**:
  - Home hazards, visual impairment, medication review.

- **Interventions Offered by Specialist Falls Services**:
  - Strength and balance training.
  - Home hazard assessment and intervention.
  - Vision assessment and referral.
  - Medication review (modification or withdrawal).

- **Reassessment Protocol**: Individuals not referred for a multifactorial assessment should be reassessed at least annually.
