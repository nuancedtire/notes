## Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) Summary

- **Definition**: CTS is an entrapment neuropathy caused by compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel at the wrist.

- **Cause**: 
  - Reduction in carpal tunnel dimensions or increased content volume leads to high pressure, causing ischemia of the median nerve.
  - Results in impaired nerve conduction, pain, and paraesthesia.

- **Prevalence**: Most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper limb.

- **Etiology**:
  - Majority are idiopathic.
  - Possible risk factors: 
    - High hand/wrist repetition activities
    - Obesity
    - Pregnancy
    - Osteoarthritis of the thumb's MCP joint
    - Rheumatoid arthritis
    - Hypothyroidism
    - Diabetes mellitus

- **Symptoms**: May resolve spontaneously in some individuals.

- **Assessment**:
  - **History**: 
    - Onset, duration, site, severity, symptom impact, exacerbating/relieving factors, hand function, sleep impact, risk factors, previous episodes/treatments, and red flags for alternative diagnoses.
  - **Physical Examination**:
    - Check for thenar muscle wasting, sensory loss in the median nerve distribution (thumb, index, middle, radial half of ring finger), reduced grip strength.
    - Examine upper limb for alternative diagnoses if presentation is atypical.
    - Perform hand provocation maneuvers.
  - **Investigations**:
    - Consider additional tests for suspected underlying causes.
    - Nerve conduction studies if diagnosis is uncertain or if surgery is planned.

- **Management**:
  - **Advice**: 
    - Provide information and support.
    - Recommend lifestyle changes (e.g., avoiding repetitive movements, work-place assessment, driving safety).
    - Optimize treatment of underlying conditions.
  - **Conservative Treatment**: 
    - Offer a 6-week trial of:
      - Nocturnal wrist splint (neutral position)
      - Corticosteroid injection
      - Hand exercises/mobilization (for mild/moderate symptoms).
    - Review after 6 weeks if symptoms persist.
  - **Referral**: Arrange specialist referral based on clinical judgment if:
    - Diagnosis is unclear.
    - Symptoms persist despite conservative treatment.
    - There are progressive symptoms or severe disease affecting daily function.
    - Symptoms recur or persist post-surgery.
