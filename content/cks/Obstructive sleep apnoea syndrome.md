## Obstructive Sleep Apnoea/Hypopnoea Syndrome (OSAHS) Summary

### Definition
- **OSAHS**: Sleep-related breathing disorder with recurrent complete/partial upper airway obstruction during sleep.
  - **Apnoea**: Complete airflow obstruction, temporary cessation of breathing.
  - **Hypopnoea**: Decreased airflow.

### Symptoms
- Excessive daytime sleepiness.
- Irregular breathing at night.
- Transient arousals from sleep to restore airway function.

### Causes
- Excessive collapsing forces around the pharynx exceeding decreased muscle tone during sleep.

### Diagnosis
- **OSAS (Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome)**: Based on sleep studies.
- Affects all age groups; prevalence increases with age and obesity.

### Risk Factors
- Increasing age.
- Male sex.
- Obesity.
- Family history of OSAS.
- Nasopharyngeal obstruction (e.g., adenotonsillar hypertrophy).
- Craniofacial abnormalities.
- Neuromuscular disorders.
- Lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, supine sleeping).

### Associated Conditions
- Cardiometabolic issues.
- Depression.
- Increased risk of work-related injuries and road traffic collisions in adults.
- In children: Behavioral problems, reduced concentration, faltering growth, and school performance issues.

### Diagnostic Indicators
- **Adults**: 
  - Excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, fatigue, witnessed apnoeas, unrefreshing sleep, impaired concentration.
- **Children**: 
  - Witnessed snoring/apnoeas, arousals, labored breathing, nocturnal enuresis, mouth breathing, behavioral problems, reduced school performance.

### Assessment
- Duration and severity of symptoms.
- Impact on quality of life.
- Risk factors and associated conditions.
- Physical examination for nasopharyngeal obstruction, craniofacial abnormalities, and vital signs (blood pressure, BMI, neck circumference).
- Screening questionnaires for symptom assessment.

### Referral Guidelines
- **Adults**: 
  - Urgent referral for severe symptoms impacting safety (e.g., professional drivers).
  - Routine referral for moderate/severe symptoms or mild symptoms affecting quality of life.
- **Children**: 
  - Refer to ENT specialist for nasopharyngeal obstruction and snoring.
  - Refer to pediatrician for congenital/developmental disorders or obesity contributing to symptoms.

### Management in Primary Care
- Provide information and support resources.
- Advise on lifestyle changes: weight loss, exercise, stop smoking, reduce alcohol, avoid supine sleeping.
- Encourage adherence to CPAP therapy and/or intra-oral devices.
- Monitor and manage associated conditions.
- Advise on driving regulations and DVLA notifications.
