## Overview of ADHD

- **Definition**: ADHD is a behavioral syndrome characterized by hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention.
- **Onset**: Symptoms are usually present since childhood, typically appearing between ages 3â€“7 but may go unrecognized until after age 7, especially if hyperactivity is absent.

## Core Symptoms

- Hyperactivity
- Inattention
- Impulsivity

## Diagnosis Criteria

1. **Duration**: Symptoms must be present for at least 6 months.

3. **Exclusion of Other Causes**: Rule out other issues such as:
   - Learning difficulties
   - Anxiety
   - Depression
   - Abuse or trauma
   - Rare medical conditions (e.g., hearing problems, epilepsy)

## Assessment and Referral

- **Specialist Referral**: Diagnosis and treatment require assessment by a specialist (e.g., pediatrician, child psychiatrist, CAMHS, or adult psychiatrist).
- **Initial Management**: Some children with moderate impairment can be managed in primary care with:
  - Self-help programs
  - Simple behavioral management
  - Parent support programs

## Treatment Options

- Treatment is coordinated by specialists based on age and degree of functional impairment. Options include:
  - Parent education/support programs
