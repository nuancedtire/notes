### Summary of Developmental Rheumatology in Children

#### Common Musculoskeletal Complaints
- **Back Pain**: Non-specific and self-limiting in school-age children and adolescents.
- **Bow Legs (Genu Varum)**: Common in children; often resolves naturally.
- **Clumsy Child**: Motor coordination difficulties affecting fine and gross motor skills (e.g., writing, dressing, self-feeding).
- **Curly Toes**: Congenital underlapping toe deformity, typically affecting the fifth and fourth toes, noticed early in infancy.
- **Flat Foot (Pes Planus)**: Common in infants; usually resolves by adolescence and is physiologically normal.
- **Heel Pain**: Common in young children and adolescents; most cases are benign.
- **Hypermobility**: Common in children; many are asymptomatic.
- **In-toeing**: Medial rotation of the foot; often self-corrects over time.
- **Knock Knees (Genu Valgum)**: Usually self-limiting, commonly seen between ages 3-6.
- **Late Walking**: Walking alone by 12 months; should walk well by 18 months. Potential causes include neuromuscular diseases and developmental hip dysplasia.
- **Growing Pains**: Common cause of recurrent pain; bilateral lower extremity pain occurring late in the day or during the night.
- **Out-toeing**: Lateral rotation of the foot; normal in infancy, resolves by 18-24 months.
- **Tip-toe Walking**: Common in children up to 3 years; involves walking on toes with absent heel strike.

#### Red Flags for Urgent Assessment
- **Emergency Department Admission**: 
  - Suspected septic arthritis
  - Suspected osteomyelitis
  - Suspected fracture
  - Suspected slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE)

- **Specialist Advice or Urgent Referral**:
  - **Rheumatology**: Suspected inflammatory arthritis; back pain with red flags.
  - **Orthopaedics**: Limping child (if SUFE not suspected); back pain with red flags; back problems (e.g., scoliosis).
  - **Paediatrics**: Suspected neurological issues; possible cancer; milestone delay or regression; suspected non-accidental injury; bladder/bowel problems; back pain with red flags.

#### Additional Features
- Other concerns may require specialist assessment, though with less urgency.
