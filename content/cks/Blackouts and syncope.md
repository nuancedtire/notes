## Blackouts and Syncope Summary

### Definitions
- **Blackout**: Transient loss of consciousness with complete recovery.
- **Transient Loss of Consciousness**: 
  - State with loss of awareness, amnesia for the period, abnormal motor control, loss of responsiveness, and short duration.
- **Syncope**: 
  - Transient loss of consciousness due to cerebral hypoperfusion.
  - Characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery.

### Causes
- **Common Causes of Syncope**:
  - **Reflexes (Neurally Mediated)**: Vasovagal, situational syncope, carotid sinus syndrome.
  - **Orthostatic Hypotension (OH)**.
  - **Cardiac Syncope**.
- **Non-Syncopal Causes of Blackout**:
  - Epilepsy or seizure.
  - Psychogenic pseudosyncope or non-epileptic seizures.
- **Unidentified Causes**: Up to one-third of cases may not have an identifiable cause.

### Prognosis
- Low-risk and younger individuals with vasovagal or situational syncope usually have an excellent prognosis.

### Complications
- Injury and falls.
- Loss of confidence, anxiety, and depression.
- Impact on work, study, and driving.
- Increased risk of road traffic collisions.

### Assessment
1. **Vital Signs**: 
   - Lying and standing blood pressure (stand for at least 1 minute).
   - Blood glucose level.
2. **Examinations**: 
   - Cardiac and neurological evaluations.
3. **History Taking**:
   - Circumstances of the event.
   - Posture beforehand.
   - Prodromal symptoms.
   - Appearance, movement, or injury during the event.
   - Tongue-biting or loss of bladder/bowel control.
   - Associated symptoms, duration, confusion afterwards, triggers.
   - Previous episodes or unexplained falls.
   - History or family history of cardiac disease or sudden death.
   - Drug treatments.
4. **Investigations**:
   - 12-lead electrocardiogram.
   - Additional tests (blood tests, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, echocardiogram) based on clinical judgement.
   - Suggest video recording of future events.

### Management
- **Education and Advice**: 
  - Sources of information and support.
- **Fitness to Drive**: 
  - Advise on safety at work and driving.
- **Referrals**:
  - To appropriate specialists for suspected cardiac causes, carotid sinus syndrome, or epilepsy.
- **Lifestyle Modifications**:
  - Advice on triggers, early recognition of prodromal symptoms, adequate fluids, physical counter-pressure maneuvers.
  - Review drug treatments for suspected reflex syncope or OH.
  - Additional advice for OH: small frequent meals, fluid bolus, dietary salt supplementation, regular physical activity, head-up tilt sleeping, compression garments.
- **Specialist Referral**:
  - Falls and syncope service or cardiologist if:
    - Diagnostic uncertainty.
    - Unexplained syncope.
    - Vasovagal syncope during high-risk activities or affecting quality of life.
    - Reflex syncope with absent or short prodrome.
    - Suspected but unconfirmed OH.
    - Persistent OH despite lifestyle modifications.
