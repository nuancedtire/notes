## Diarrhoea - Antibiotic Associated: Quick Revision Guide

### Overview
- Diarrhoea occurs in 2–25% of people taking antibiotics.
- 20%–30% of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea cases are due to **Clostridioides difficile** (CDI).

### Antibiotics Commonly Associated with CDI
- Clindamycin
- Cephalosporins (3rd and 4th generation)
- Fluoroquinolones
- Broad-spectrum penicillins

### Risk Factors for CDI
- Increased age
- Frailty
- Previous history of CDI
- Exposure to other CDI cases
- Concomitant use of proton pump inhibitors or acid-suppressing drugs
- Underlying co-morbidities (e.g., abdominal surgery, chronic renal disease, inflammatory bowel disease, immunosuppression)

### Complications of CDI
- Pseudomembranous colitis
- Toxic megacolon
- Colon perforation
- Sepsis
- Death

### Management and Assessment
- Assess severity of symptoms; consider hospital admission.
- If CDI is suspected:
  - Determine if it's a first episode or a relapse/recurrence.
  - Obtain a stool sample for testing.

#### If CDI is **not suspected** or test is **negative**:
- Stop the antibiotic (if appropriate).
- Manage fluid loss and symptoms as for acute gastroenteritis.

#### If CDI is **suspected or confirmed**:
- **Non-severe CDI**:
  - Manage with antibiotics (consult microbiologist/infectious diseases specialist).
  - Assess outbreak risk in vulnerable populations (e.g., elderly care homes).
  - Stop other non-CDI antibiotics (if appropriate).
  - Manage fluid loss and symptoms.
  - Avoid antidiarrheal drugs (e.g., loperamide).
  - Implement hygiene measures to prevent spread.
  
- **Infectious Period**: Diarrhoea should resolve in 1–2 weeks; individual remains infectious until symptom-free for 48 hours.

#### Severe and Fulminant CDI
- Require hospital management.
- Referral for high-risk individuals or recurrent infections after two previous CDI episodes should be considered.
