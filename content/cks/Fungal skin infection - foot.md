## Fungal Skin Infection - Foot (Athlete's Foot / Tinea Pedis)

### Overview
- **Definition**: Superficial skin infection of the feet and toes, mainly caused by dermatophytes.
- **Common Sub-types**:
  - **Interdigital**: Most common; affects lateral toe web spaces; usually caused by *Trichophyton rubrum*.
  - **Moccasin / Dry**: Chronic scaling and hyperkeratosis on the sole and lateral foot; usually caused by *Trichophyton rubrum*.
  - **Vesicobullous**: Least common; small vesicles and blisters on arches and soles; usually caused by *Trichophyton interdigitale*.

### Risk Factors
- Hot, humid climates or work environments
- Occlusive footwear
- Hyperhidrosis
- Walking on contaminated surfaces
- Immunocompromised states
- Common in adolescents; rare in pre-pubertal children

### Diagnosis
- Based on clinical features and symptom history (itchy, flaky, or painful skin).
- **Assessment should include**:
  - Nature, site, and duration of symptoms
  - Previous treatments
  - Close contacts and co-morbidities
  - Pattern, extent, and severity of infection
  - Skin sampling for microscopy and culture if severe or uncertain

### Initial Management
- **Self-care strategies**: Provide information on general care.
- **Topical treatments**:
  - Mild cases: Topical antifungal creams (terbinafine, imidazole, undecenoic acid, tolnaftate).
  - If marked inflammation present: Short-term mildly-potent topical corticosteroid (e.g., hydrocortisone cream).
- **Oral antifungal**: 
  - First-line for severe/extensive disease in adults (terbinafine preferred).
  - Alternatives: Oral itraconazole or griseofulvin if terbinafine is not tolerated.
- Manage concomitant infections (nail, hand, groin) to reduce reinfection risk.

### Persisting Infection Management
- Address underlying causes of treatment failure (non-adherence, reinfection).
- Arrange skin sampling for microscopy and culture.
- Prescribe oral antifungals based on results and clinical judgement.

### Referral to Dermatology
- Consider if:
  - Severe/extensive disease or unsuccessful topical treatment in children.
  - Uncertain diagnosis.
  - Treatment in primary care fails.
  - Immunocompromised status warrants specialist input.
