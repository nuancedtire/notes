## Sinusitis Overview

### Definition
- **Sinusitis (Rhinosinusitis)**: Inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity.

### Classification
1. **Acute Sinusitis**: Symptoms resolve within 12 weeks.
   - **Acute Viral**: Symptoms last less than 10 days.
   - **Acute Post-Viral**: Symptoms worsen after 5 days or persist for 10-12 weeks.
   - **Acute Bacterial**: Secondary infection in 0.5–2% of acute viral cases.

2. **Chronic Sinusitis**: Symptoms last 12 weeks or longer.
   - Classified as primary or secondary.
   - Further classified by:
     - Anatomic distribution
     - Endotype dominance
     - Clinical phenotypes

### Diagnosis
- **Acute Sinusitis**: Based on history and examination.
  - **Adults**: 
    - Symptoms: Nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pain/pressure, reduced sense of smell.
  - **Children**: 
    - Symptoms: Nasal blockage, discolored nasal discharge, cough.
  - **Acute Bacterial Diagnosis**: At least three criteria:
    - Symptoms > 10 days
    - Discolored/purulent nasal discharge
    - Severe local pain
    - Fever > 38°C
    - Deterioration after initial mild phase.

- **Chronic Sinusitis**: Requires subjective and objective evidence of sinonasal inflammation.
  - **Adults**: Same diagnostic symptoms as acute.
  - **Children**: Same diagnostic symptoms as acute.

### Management
- **Acute Sinusitis**:
  - Advise on natural course and causes.
  - Recommend symptom relief (analgesia, nasal saline, decongestants).
  - Advise medical help if:
    - Symptoms worsen rapidly.
    - No improvement after 3 weeks.
    - Systemic illness develops.
  - Consider antibiotics (not routinely indicated).

- **Chronic Sinusitis**:
  - Manage associated disorders (e.g., allergic rhinitis, asthma).
  - Advise avoidance of exacerbating factors (e.g., allergens).
  - Consider high-dose nasal corticosteroids for persistent symptoms in adults and children (≥ 12 years).

### Urgent Referral
- **Hospital Admission**: If:
  - Severe systemic infection
  - Signs of sepsis
  - Complications (orbital/intracranial involvement)
  - Reduced consciousness

- **Cancer Pathway Referral**: If symptoms suggest neoplasm (e.g., persistent unilateral symptoms, nasal obstruction, discharge, nosebleeds, crusting, facial swelling).

- **Specialist Referral**: Consider if:
  - Diagnosis is uncertain.
  - Symptoms are recurrent or refractory to treatment.
  - Symptoms significantly affect quality of life.
