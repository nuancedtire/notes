## Scabies Overview

- **Cause**: Infestation by the human parasite *Sarcoptes scabiei*.
- **Types**:
  - **Classical (Typical) Scabies**: Low number of mites (5-15 per host).
  - **Crusted (Norwegian) Scabies**: Hyperinfestation with thousands/millions of mites.

## Prevalence
- Estimated over 200 million cases worldwide, varying by locality.

## Risk Factors
- Close contact with infested individuals.
- High levels of poverty and social deprivation.
- Crowded living conditions and institutionalization.
- Winter months (increased crowding, mite survival).

## Crusted Scabies Risk Groups
- Individuals with immunosuppression (e.g., HIV, lymphoma, long-term corticosteroids).
- Those with reduced ability to scratch (e.g., physical incapacity, skin anesthesia).
- Individuals with learning difficulties or neurological disorders (e.g., Down's syndrome, dementia).
- Elderly individuals.

## Complications
- Secondary bacterial infections leading to:
  - Cellulitis
  - Folliculitis
  - Boils
  - Impetigo
  - Lymphangitis

## Prognosis
- Generally good with adequate treatment compliance.
- Crusted scabies may need prolonged and repeated treatment.

## Diagnosis
- Primarily through history and examination.
- Skin scraping microscopy can confirm diagnosis.

## Management
1. **Treatment**:
   - Topical insecticide (permethrin 5% cream) for affected individuals and all close contacts.
   - Symptomatic treatment for itching (e.g., topical crotamiton).
   - Treat complications (e.g., cellulitis).
  
2. **Follow-up**:
   - Not generally required unless symptoms persist after 2-4 weeks.
   - Consider oral ivermectin for resistant cases.

3. **Special Considerations**:
   - Rare in children under 2 months; seek specialist advice.
   - If crusted scabies is suspected, consult a dermatologist.
   - Potential need for hospitalization and combination therapy. 

4. **Investigations**:
   - Assess for underlying immunodeficiency if crusted scabies is suspected.
