### Investigations 
- Guided by symptoms, history, and examination:
  - Urine dipstick test (check for blood, glucose, protein, leucocytes, nitrites)

   - **5-alpha reductase inhibitor**: For LUTS with prostate >30 g or PSA >1.4 ng/ml, at high risk of progression
   - **Antimuscarinic**: For overactive bladder symptoms; consider mirabegron if contraindicated
   - **Loop diuretic/Oral desmopressin**: For nocturnal polyuria
   - **Combination treatments**: Where appropriate
4. **Regular Review**: 
   - Re-assess symptoms, quality of life, and adverse effects
