## Neck Lump: Summary

### Definition
- Abnormal lesion (congenital or acquired) below the mandible, above the clavicle, and deep to the skin.
  
### Causes
- Skin infections
- Lymphadenopathy
- Benign tumors
- Primary malignant tumors
- Thyroid lumps
- Salivary gland lumps
- Congenital and developmental lumps
- Carotid body tumors and aneurysms
- Trauma

### Age Groups
- Children: Most likely benign causes (e.g., reactive cervical lymphadenopathy).
- Adults: Malignancy risk increases with age, especially over 40. Rare but includes lymphomas, thyroid cancer, and soft tissue sarcomas.

### Assessment
1. **History Taking**
   - Site, onset, size, growth, changes, and timescale of the lump.
   - Red flag symptoms:
     - Local malignancy: dysphagia, odynophagia, persistent cough, sore throat, hoarseness, hemoptysis.
     - Hematological malignancy: persistent fatigue, night sweats, unexplained fever, weight loss.
   - Risk factors: smoking, excess alcohol, previous head/neck cancer, irradiation.
   - Co-morbidities and family history.

2. **Physical Examination**
   - Assess for stridor, superior vena cava compression, dysphagia with aspiration (emergency admission).
   - Examine neck for position, size, pulsatility, consistency, tenderness, mobility, nodularity, and skin appearance.
   - Check for localized or generalized lymphadenopathy.
   - Conduct head, neck, and general examination (skin, ears, nose, throat, oral cavity, chest, abdomen).

3. **Investigations**
   - Avoid arranging investigations in primary care that may delay specialist referral.

### Management in Primary Care
- **Dependent on Likely Cause:**
  - Treat superficial skin infections or deep abscesses.
  - Manage suspected bacterial infections causing lymphadenopathy.
  - Urgent referrals:
    - Malignant primary tumors of the head and neck.
    - Hematological malignancies (full blood count).
    - Lung cancer (chest X-ray).
    - Oral or laryngeal cancer.
    - Thyroid mass/nodule.
    - Congenital, developmental, or carotid neck lump (urgency varies).
    - Unexplained neck lump increasing in size (urgent neck ultrasound and referral for soft tissue sarcoma assessment).
