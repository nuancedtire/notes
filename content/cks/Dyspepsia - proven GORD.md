## Dyspepsia and Proven GORD: Summary

### Definition
- **Dyspepsia**: Complex of upper gastrointestinal symptoms lasting 4+ weeks, including:
  - Upper abdominal pain/discomfort
  - Heartburn
  - Acid reflux
  - Nausea/vomiting

- **Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)**: Chronic condition with reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus, primarily causing:
  - Heartburn
  - Acid regurgitation

### Proven GORD
- **Proven GORD**: Endoscopically-determined reflux disease, categorized into:
  - **Oesophagitis**: Inflammation and mucosal erosions observed.
  - **Endoscopy-negative reflux disease (non-erosive reflux disease)**: Symptoms present, but endoscopy results normal.

### Risk Factors
- **Lifestyle Factors**:
  - Obesity
  - Trigger foods
  - Smoking
  - Alcohol
  - Coffee
  - Stress

- **Medications**: Decrease lower oesophageal sphincter pressure:
  - Calcium-channel blockers
  - Anticholinergics
  - Theophylline
  - Benzodiazepines
  - Nitrates

- **Pregnancy**

### Recurrence Risks
- **Annual risk of recurrence**: 50%
- **Lifetime risk of recurrence**: 80%
- Higher relapse likelihood in severe oesophagitis cases.

### Complications
- **Barrett's oesophagus**: Develops in 10–15% of GORD patients.
- **Oesophageal adenocarcinoma**: 1–10% risk in Barrett's patients over 10–20 years.

### Initial Management
1. **Lifestyle measures**:
   - Raise head of bed.
2. **Medication review**:
   - Stop exacerbating drugs if possible.
3. **Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)**:
   - Full-dose for 4 weeks for proven GORD.
   - Full-dose for 8 weeks for severe oesophagitis.

### Management of Refractory or Recurrent Symptoms
- Consider alternate diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, hepatobiliary).
- Check adherence to management.
- Reinforce lifestyle advice.
- Options include:
  - Further 4 weeks of initial PPI (full/double-dose).
  - Add H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) at bedtime for confirmed oesophagitis.
  - Switch to H2RA for endoscopy-negative reflux disease.
  - High-dose PPI for 8 weeks for severe oesophagitis.
  - Long-term maintenance PPI if severe oesophagitis symptoms controlled.

### Long-term Treatment
- Annual review for long-term GORD patients.
- Encourage stepping down or stopping treatment if appropriate.

### Referral Considerations
- **Gastroenterologist or upper GI surgeon referral** for:
  - Refractory, persistent, or unexplained symptoms.
  - Patients controlled on acid suppression but prefer not to continue or cannot tolerate long-term.
  - Patients with risk factors for Barrett's oesophagus.
