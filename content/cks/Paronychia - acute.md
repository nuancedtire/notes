### Acute Paronychia Summary

- **Definition**: Localized, superficial infection/abscess of the lateral and proximal skin fold around a nail (perionychium) causing painful swelling.
  
- **Etiology**: Most commonly caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*.

- **Demographics**: 
  - Common in all age groups.
  - Three times more prevalent in women than men.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Barrier disruption or trauma to the skin around the nail.
  - Local factors: aggressive manicuring, artificial nails, frequent hand immersion in water, finger sucking, nail biting, hang nails, ingrown nails, trauma, and pemphigus vulgaris.

- **Resolution**: Most cases resolve in 2â€“4 days with treatment. Untreated infections may lead to chronic paronychia or complications like tendon damage and nail loss.

- **Typical Features**:
  - Pain and swelling at the base of the fingernail.
  - Localized pain and tenderness of the nail folds.
  - Red, tender, swollen lateral and/or proximal nail folds, often with visible pus.

- **Conditions Mimicking Paronychia**:
  - Cutaneous candidiasis
  - Acute contact dermatitis
  - Staphylococcal whitlow
  - Finger-tip injuries
  - Insect bites
  - Fungal nail infections
  - Herpetic whitlow
  - Cancer (melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma)
  - Psoriasis
  - Reactive arthritis
  - Dyshidrotic eczema
  - Pemphigus vulgaris
  - Foreign body

- **Management**:
  - If fluctuant pus collection/abscess: Incision and drainage recommended (may require referral to surgical unit/emergency department).
  - Moist heat application (3-4 times daily) to alleviate pain and promote drainage.

- **When to Swab**:
  - Enlarging paronychia.
  - Inflammation of surrounding tissue.
  - Recurrent paronychia.
  - Lack of response to treatment in 2-3 days.
  - Systemically unwell patient.
  - History of contact with MRSA.
  - Diagnostic uncertainty.
  - Immunosuppressed individual.
  - Patient with diabetes.

- **Antibiotic Use**:
  - Required if incision and drainage are not performed, signs of cellulitis or fever are present, or if comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, immunosuppression) exist.
  - First-line antibiotics: Flucloxacillin or clarithromycin.
