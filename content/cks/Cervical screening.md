- **Cervical Cancer Overview**
  - 14th most common cancer in females in the UK.
  - Approximately 3,200 new cases annually.
  - Highest incidence in females aged 30–34 years.
  - Rare in individuals under 25, despite common cervical abnormalities in this group.

- **NHS Cervical Screening Programme (NHSCSP)**
  - Aims to reduce incidence and mortality from cervical cancer.
  - Systematic, quality-assured, population-based screening.
  - Introduction of the program has halved cervical cancer deaths.
  - Estimated to save around 4,500 lives annually in England.

- **Eligibility for Screening**
  - Available to women and individuals with a cervix aged 25–64 years.
  - Screening invitations sent at specific ages and intervals:
    - **Age 24.5 years**: First invitation to complete screening by 25th birthday.
    - **Ages 25–49 years**: Recall every 3 years (invitations 34.5 months after previous test).
    - **Ages 50–64 years**: Recall every 5 years (invitations 58.5 months after previous test).
    - **Ages 65+ years**: Invited if a recent cytology sample is abnormal or if they haven’t had a test since age 50 and request one.

- **Screening Process**
  - **Primary HPV Screening**: Identifies high-risk HPV (hrHPV) linked to cervical cancer.
  - **Liquid-Based Cytology**: Conducted if hrHPV is found to detect early cervical abnormalities.
  - **Colposcopy**: Used to diagnose cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and differentiate between high-grade and low-grade lesions.

- **Withdrawal from Screening**
  - Individuals can withdraw voluntarily by written request.
  - Must be provided with sufficient information to make an informed decision.
