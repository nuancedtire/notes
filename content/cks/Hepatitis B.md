## Hepatitis B Summary

- **Definition**: Infectious liver disease caused by the hepatitis B virus.

- **Prevalence in the UK**: 
  - 1-2% have antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc).
  - Most new infections occur in adulthood.
  - Common transmission routes: sexual contact, sharing injecting drug equipment.

- **Acute Hepatitis B**:
  - Symptoms and jaundice last 1-3 months.
  - Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) clears in ~95% of immunocompetent adults.
  - Fulminant hepatitis occurs in <1% of cases; can be fatal.

- **Chronic Hepatitis B**:
  - Defined by persistence of serum HBsAg for >6 months.
  - Occurs in:
    - ~10% of infants born to hepatitis B-positive mothers (if not immunized).
    - 10-20% of children infected later in childhood.
    - ~5% of healthy adults infected.
  - Most are asymptomatic; some may develop chronic active hepatitis.
  - Cirrhosis develops in 15-20% of healthy adults over 20 years.
  - Hepatocellular cancer develops in ~10% of those with cirrhosis; detected ~30 years post-infection.

- **Management**:
  - Admission for severe cases or referral to a liver specialist for follow-up and treatment.
  - Pre-treatment blood tests and liver ultrasound are necessary.
  - Provide symptomatic supportive treatment (rest, pain relief, nausea, itch).
  - Notify Health Protection Unit.
  - Advise avoiding alcohol and prevent transmission.
  - Referral to genito-urinary medicine clinic and/or drug rehab if appropriate.
  - Specialist monitoring and possible antiviral treatment for confirmed chronic infection.
