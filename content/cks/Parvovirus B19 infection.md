- Typically a **mild, self-limiting illness**.

### Complications
- Rare in healthy individuals.
- Increased risk in:
  - **Pregnant women**
    - Complications: hydrops fetalis, fetal death.
  - **Immunocompromised individuals**
  - **People with haematological disorders**
    - Complications: transient aplastic anaemia, pure red cell aplasia, persistent anaemia.

### Diagnosis
- **Healthy Children**
  - Usually clinical.
  - Symptoms: acute biphasic illness, diffuse erythematous facial rash (one or both cheeks), possible prodromal symptoms, maculopapular rash on trunk, back, limbs.
  
- **Healthy Adults**

  - Facial rash is rare; maculopapular rash may develop, along with symmetrical polyarthropathy.

- **Laboratory Investigation**
  - Not typically required in healthy children/adults.
  - If suspected in immunocompromised or haematological disorders: 
    - Urgent blood tests for high-titre viral DNA and full blood count (including reticulocyte count).

### Management
- **For Children and Non-Pregnant Adults with Suspected Infection**
  - Symptom relief (e.g., analgesia).
  - Exclusion from school/nursery/work is usually not necessary (non-infectious after 1 day post-rash/symptoms).
  - Avoid contact with high-risk individuals.

- **For Individuals Exposed to Infection**
  - Avoid contact with high-risk individuals.

- **For Pregnant Women with Suspected Infection or Exposure**
  - Immediate contact with local virology/microbiology/infectious diseases department for advice on laboratory investigations and monitoring.
  - Advise avoiding contact with other pregnant women and high-risk individuals until status is confirmed (uninfected, immune, or non-infectious).
  - If confirmed, urgent referral to a fetal medicine specialist for monitoring and management.
