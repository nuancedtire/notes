- **Definition of Malnutrition**: 
  - A state of nutrient deficiency (energy, protein, vitamins, minerals) causing adverse effects on body composition, function, or clinical outcome.
  - It is both a cause and consequence of ill health.

- **Criteria for Malnutrition**:
  - **Malnourished individuals**:
    - BMI < 18.5 kg/m²
    - Unintentional weight loss > 10% in the last 3–6 months
    - BMI < 20 kg/m² and unintentional weight loss > 5% in the last 3–6 months

- **At-Risk Individuals**:
  - Eaten little or nothing for > 5 days or likely to eat little or nothing for the next 5 days or longer.
  - Poor absorptive capacity/high nutrient losses/increased nutritional needs.

- **Common Reasons for Malnutrition**:
  - Acute illness
  - Frailty
  - Increasing age
  - Appetite issues
  - Eating and swallowing difficulties
  - Neurological diseases
  - Chronic conditions
  - Psychological factors
  - Socioeconomic factors

- **Complications of Malnutrition**:
  - Increased vulnerability to disease/infection
  - Reduced wound healing
  - Pressure ulcers
  - Frailty and falls
  - Reduced function
  - Mental health issues (anxiety, depression)
  - Cognitive impairment
  - Increased social and healthcare costs

- **Screening for Malnutrition**:
  - **Opportunistic Screening**:
    - Initial registration in general practice
    - Routine health checks/immunisations
    - Structured medication reviews
    - Contact with community/district nurses
    - Admission to new care settings (e.g., care homes)
    
  - **Clinical Concerns**:
    - Unintentional/unplanned weight loss
    - Apathy or fatigue
    - Poor appetite or swallowing difficulties
    - Altered bowel habits or gut function
    - Prolonged illness or recurrent infections
    - Reduced physical function or frequent falls
    - Thin appearance, sarcopenia, loose clothing
    - Fragile skin, poor wound healing, or pressure ulcers

- **Assessment for Malnutrition**:
  - Ask about:
    - Nutritional intake
    - Unintentional weight loss
    - Energy, strength, activity levels
    - Swallowing/appetite issues
    - Mood/cognitive changes
    - Gastrointestinal symptoms
    - Comorbidities
    - Drug/alcohol intake
    - Social situation
  
  - Examination for:
    - Signs of malnutrition, acute illness, dehydration
    - Mobility and muscle strength
    - Weight loss trends and BMI
    - Consideration of baseline blood tests

- **Management of Malnutrition**:
  - Provide a nutritional care plan including dietary advice.
  - Manage underlying conditions, causes, risk factors, and complications.
  - Set individualized treatment goals.
  - Provide information and support.
  - Prescribe oral nutritional supplementation if needed, and discontinue when appropriate.
  - Refer to specialists (dietitian, speech and language therapist, occupational therapist, physiotherapist, mental health team, adult social care) if indicated.
  - Monitor progress based on clinical judgment.
