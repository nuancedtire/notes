### Classification (ICHD)
1. **Infrequent episodic**: 
   - < 1 day of headache/month (self-limiting).
2. **Frequent episodic**: 
   - ≥ 10 episodes occurring on < 15 days/month for > 3 months.
3. **Chronic**: 
   - Evolves from frequent episodic; ≥ 15 days of headache/month for > 3 months without medication overuse.

### Mechanism
- Exact cause unknown.
- **Episodic**: Peripheral pain mechanisms may play a role.
- **Chronic**: Central pain mechanisms and heightened sensitivity to pain may be more important.

### Impact
- Significant impact on quality of life (work, home, school).

### Symptoms (ICHD criteria)
- Recurrent episodes lasting 30 minutes to 7 days.
- Not associated with nausea/vomiting.

### Management
#### For Episodic Tension-Type Headache
- Reassurance and information support.
- Warn about risk of medication overuse headache.
- Recommend over-the-counter analgesics (paracetamol, aspirin, NSAIDs); avoid opioids.
- Assess and manage triggers (stress, neck pain, sleep disorders).

#### For Frequent Episodic or Chronic Tension-Type Headache
- Avoid frequent/excessive acute analgesia (risk of medication overuse).
- Consider acupuncture.
- Explore physiotherapy, regular exercise, CBT, relaxation techniques.
- Offer trial of amitriptyline (off-label).
- Use headache calendar to monitor symptoms/treatment response.
- Keep a headache diary if co-existing headache disorders (e.g., migraine) are suspected.

### Referral Criteria
- Specialist referral if:
  - Red flags or serious secondary headache suspected.
  - Diagnostic uncertainty or atypical symptoms.
  - Symptoms persist despite optimal management in primary care.
