## Breast Pain - Cyclical: Summary

### Definition
- Cyclical breast pain is linked to the menstrual cycle.
- Exact cause is not fully understood; hormonal changes affecting breast tissue are thought to play a role.

### Prevalence
- Affects up to two-thirds of women.
- 1 in 10 women experience moderate-to-severe pain.

### Clinical Features
- **Pain Characteristics**:
  - Usually starts in the luteal phase (within 2 weeks before menses).
  - Increases until menstruation begins, improves after menses.
  - Dull, heavy, or aching in nature.
  - Usually bilateral.
  - May be poorly localized, extending to the axilla.

### Diagnostic Considerations
- Conduct a thorough history and examination to exclude other causes (e.g., malignancy, infection, pregnancy).
- Low likelihood of breast cancer if no suspicious clinical features (e.g., lump, nipple discharge).
- A breast pain diary for at least two cycles may assist in diagnosis.

### Management
1. **Reassurance**:
   - Confirmed cyclical breast pain does not indicate serious underlying pathology.
   
2. **Advice**:
   - Wear a well-fitted bra during the day.
   - Use supportive bras during exercise and soft support bras at night.

3. **Pain Relief**:
   - First-line options: 
     - Oral paracetamol and/or ibuprofen.
     - Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory preparations as needed.
   - Pain diary may help assess severity, timing, and treatment response.

4. **Referral**:
   - If pain severely affects quality of life and sleep, and does not respond to first-line treatments after 3 months, consider referral to a specialist for alternative treatments.

### Treatments Not Routinely Recommended
- Evening primrose oil.
- Flaxseed.
- Low-fat or low-caffeine diets.
- Vitamin B6.
- Vitamin E.
- Stopping or changing contraceptives.
