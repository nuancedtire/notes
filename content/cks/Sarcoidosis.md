- **Sarcoidosis Overview**
  - Multisystem disease of unknown aetiology.
  - Characterized by non-caseating granulomas (inflammation and scarring).

- **Commonly Affected Organs**
  - **Lungs:** ~90% of individuals.
  - **Skin:** Second most affected.
  - Other organs: Eyes, brain, nervous system, liver, heart.

- **Etiology**
  - Unknown cause, possibly an inflammatory response to environmental agents or infections in genetically predisposed individuals.

- **Disease Course**
  - **Remission:** ~66% achieve remission within 2–5 years; most require no treatment.
  - **Residual Fibrosis:** ~25% develop fibrosis in lungs or other areas.
  - **Chronic Disease:** 10–30% may have chronic sarcoidosis requiring prolonged treatment.

- **Symptoms**
  - Dyspnoea, persistent cough, wheezing, non-cardiac [[chest pain]], skin changes, eye involvement.
  - Some may be asymptomatic; disease might be detected incidentally on chest X-ray.

- **Diagnosis**
  - Use of lung function tests, blood tests, and 12-lead ECG.
  - Chest X-ray offered for suspected cases; helps in staging.
  - Referral to specialists based on organ involvement for confirmation and treatment assessment.

- **Monitoring**
  - **Stage I Pulmonary Sarcoidosis:** Monitor for up to 2 years for remission/progression.
  - **Stages II to IV Pulmonary Sarcoidosis:** Likely requires long-term monitoring.
  - **Extrapulmonary Involvement:** Long-term monitoring every 6 months.
  - Patients withdrawing from corticosteroids also need ongoing monitoring.

- **Treatment**
  - **First-line:** Corticosteroids (topical or oral).
  - **Second-line:** Immunosuppressants.
  - **Third-line:** Biologics.
