## Allergic Conjunctivitis Summary

### Definition
- Allergic conjunctivitis refers to ocular conditions linked to an **Immunoglobulin E (IgE) hypersensitivity reaction**.

### Types
1. **Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis**
   - Occurs periodically with seasonal allergens (e.g., pollen from trees and grass).
   
2. **Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis**
   - Associated with non-seasonal allergens in the home (e.g., dust mites, mold spores, animal dander).
   
3. **Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis**
   - Most common and severe in hot, arid climates (e.g., Mediterranean, West Africa, India).
   
4. **Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis**
   - Severe form that often accompanies atopic dermatitis of the eyelids.
   
5. **Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis**
   - Has a mechanical component, often due to chronic micro-trauma (e.g., from contact lenses or ocular prostheses).

### Clinical Features
- **Main Feature**: Itching
- Other Symptoms:
  - Watery or mucoid discharge
  - Conjunctival redness (injection)
  - Oedema of conjunctiva (chemosis) and eyelids

### Exclusion of Serious Causes
- Important to rule out serious conditions (e.g., acute glaucoma, corneal ulcer, keratitis).
- **Red Flags** for urgent referral to ophthalmology:
  - Pain
  - Photophobia
  - Change in visual acuity
  - Pupillary abnormality
- Urgent referral needed for:
  - Systemic diseases with eye symptoms (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome)
  - Contact lens wearers with suspected corneal involvement
  - Neonates with a red sticky eye

### Management in Primary Care
- **Patient Information**: Provide guidance on allergic conjunctivitis.
- **Self-Care Advice**:
  - Avoid allergens and eye rubbing
  - Use cold compresses and ocular lubricants
- **Medications**:
  - Consider topical antihistamines and/or mast cell stabilizers
  - Topical diclofenac as adjunctive therapy if necessary
- **Follow-Up**: Monitor for red flag features needing urgent review.
