## Hypercalcaemia: Summary

### Definition
- **Hypercalcaemia**: Serum calcium concentration ≥ 2.6 mmol/L on two occasions, with correction for serum albumin concentration.

### Classification of Severity
- **Mild Hypercalcaemia**: 2.6–3.00 mmol/L
- **Moderate Hypercalcaemia**: 3.01–3.40 mmol/L
- **Severe Hypercalcaemia**: > 3.40 mmol/L

### Common Causes
1. **Primary Hyperparathyroidism**
2. **Malignancy**
3. Other causes:
   - Drugs
   - Granulomatous diseases
   - Renal disease
   - Non-parathyroid endocrine diseases
   - Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia
   - Immobility

### Diagnosis Considerations
- **Incidental finding**: Corrected serum calcium ≥ 2.6 mmol/L
- **Clinical features**: Bone pain, osteoporosis, fatigue, confusion, memory issues, depression, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, thirst, polyuria, constipation, renal colic, renal impairment.

### Confirmation of Diagnosis
- Check corrected serum calcium concentration.
- Classify severity:
  - **Severe Hypercalcaemia**: Arrange emergency hospital admission.
  - **Mild/Moderate Hypercalcaemia**: Repeat corrected serum calcium concentration for confirmation.

### Assessment of Unexplained Hypercalcaemia
- Gather clinical features, co-morbidities, family history, and drug treatments.
- Assess hydration status and signs of underlying causes.
- Review duration and pattern of hypercalcaemia.
- Arrange additional tests (blood, urine, chest X-ray) based on clinical judgement.

### Management
1. **Unexplained Hypercalcaemia**:
   - Refer to endocrinologist for suspected primary hyperparathyroidism or related causes.
   - Refer to appropriate specialist for other suspected causes.
   - Reduce or stop causative drugs and monitor response.

2. **Hypercalcaemia of Malignancy**:
   - Discuss management appropriateness with patients/carers.
   - Liaise with oncologist or palliative care specialist for ongoing management.

### Follow-Up in Primary Care
- Provide information and support resources.
- Monitor for symptoms of hypercalcaemia.
- Arrange monitoring of:
  - Serum calcium
  - Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)
  - Creatinine
  - Bone mineral density
  - Renal imaging (as needed)
- Refer to endocrinologist or liaise with oncologist/palliative care as indicated.
- Offer lifestyle advice to reduce recurrent hypercalcaemia risk.
