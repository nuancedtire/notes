## Earwax Overview

- **Composition**:  
  - Dead flattened cells  
  - Cerumen (wax-like substance)  
  - Sebum  
  - Foreign substances (e.g., cosmetics, dirt)  

- **Function**:  
  - Cleans, lubricates, and protects ear canal  
  - Traps dirt, dust, and hair  
  - Repels water  
  - Inhibits bacterial and fungal growth due to acidity  

- **Natural Elimination**:  
  - Typically removed through natural jaw movement  
  - Retained wax can become impacted if elimination is disrupted  

## When to Remove Earwax

- **Indications for removal**:  
  - Total occlusion of the ear canal  
  - Symptomatic individual  
  - Obscured tympanic membrane that needs viewing for diagnosis  
  - Individual with hearing aid needing an impression or experiencing whistling due to wax  

## Initial Management

1. **Ear Drops**:  
   - Softening treatment for 3â€“5 days  
   - Avoid if perforated tympanic membrane is suspected  

2. **Ear Irrigation**:  
   - Consider if symptoms persist without contraindications  

## Referral to Specialist

Refer to an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) specialist if:  
- Chronic tympanic membrane perforation  
- History of ear surgery  
- Foreign body in ear canal  
- Unsuccessful ear drops and irrigation is contraindicated  
- Multiple ineffective attempts to remove impacted earwax  
- Persistent symptoms despite resolved impaction  

## Urgent Specialist Advice

Seek urgent advice if:  
- Severe pain, deafness, or vertigo occurs during/after irrigation  
- Perforation is observed post-procedure  
- Infection is present and external canal needs to be cleared of wax, debris, and discharge
