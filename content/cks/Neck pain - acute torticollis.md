## Neck Pain - Acute Torticollis: Summary

### Definition
- Torticollis (wry neck): painful neck condition.
- Acute torticollis: caused by minor local musculoskeletal irritation, leading to pain and muscle spasms.

### Possible Causes
- Often unclear; may include:
  - Poor posture (e.g., computer use, inappropriate seating).
  - Inadequate neck support while sleeping.
  - Carrying heavy or unbalanced loads.

### Assessment
1. **Medical History & Physical Examination**
   - Distinguish between neuropathic pain and mechanical neck pain.
   
2. **Exclude Red Flags**
   - Signs of serious spinal or other abnormalities:
     - Myelopathy
     - Cancer
     - Severe trauma/skeletal injury
     - Vascular insufficiency

3. **Identify Typical Features**
   - Sudden onset of severe unilateral pain.
   - Restricted and painful neck movements.
   - Diffuse tenderness and palpable spasm on the affected side.

4. **Exclude Other Causes of Muscle Spasms**
   - Acute disc prolapse
   - Tonsillitis
   - Cervical lymphadenopathy
   - Cervical spine injury
   - Neurological disorders (e.g., dystonia)

### Features Indicating Serious Pathology
- Neurological symptoms/signs.
- Malaise, fever, unexplained weight loss, unremitting pain affecting sleep.
- History of violent trauma, neck surgery, or osteoporosis risk factors.

### Management
- **Reassurance**
  - Symptoms typically resolve within 24â€“48 hours.

- **Pain Relief**
  - Oral analgesics (e.g., paracetamol, ibuprofen, with/without codeine).

- **Referrals**
  - Physiotherapy if needed.
  - Refer patients with red-flag symptoms.

- **Self-Care Advice**
  - Use intermittent heat or cold packs to alleviate pain and spasms.
  - Sleep on a low, firm pillow and maintain good posture.
  - Avoid routine use of a soft cervical collar.
  - Do not drive due to limited head rotation.
  - Encourage neck flexibility exercises.
