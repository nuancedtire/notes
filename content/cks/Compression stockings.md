- **Purpose**: Compression stockings treat chronic venous insufficiency conditions like:
  - Varicose veins
  - Venous ulcers
  - Venous eczema
  - Post-thrombotic syndrome
  - Lipodermatosclerosis
  - Superficial vein thrombosis
  - Lymphoedema
  - Lipoedema

- **Function**: Provide graduated pressure (distal to proximal) to improve venous blood flow via calf-muscle pump action.

- **Types**:
  - **Compression Classes** (measured at the ankle):
    - Class 1: 14–17 mmHg (light compression)
    - Class 2: 18–24 mmHg (medium compression)
    - Class 3: 25–35 mmHg (high compression)
  - **Lengths**: Below knee or thigh length
  - **Styles**: Closed or open toe

- **Standards**:
  - Primary care follows British standards.
  - Specialist settings may provide European standard stockings with greater compression.

- **Assessment Before Prescription**:
  - Measure ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) using Doppler:
    - ABPI < 0.8: Contraindicated; refer for specialist vascular assessment.
    - ABPI 0.8–1.3: Safe to wear.
    - ABPI > 1.3: Avoid compression; refer for specialist vascular assessment.

- **Skin Condition**: 
  - Check for fragile skin to prevent damage during use.
  - Ensure venous ulcers are healed before using stockings.

- **User Capability**: 
  - Assess if the person can manage stockings (e.g., arthritis may hinder use).

- **Degree of Compression**:
  - Varicose veins: Class 1 or 2 (severity-dependent).
  - Venous eczema/lipodermatosclerosis: Class 2; Class 3 if inadequate response.
  - Superficial vein thrombosis: Class 2 preferred, consider Class 1 or travel socks.

- **Stocking Preferences**:
  - Below-knee stockings preferred; thigh-length for severe issues above the knee.
  - Open toe stockings may be needed for:
    - Arthritic/clawed toes or fungal infections
    - Preference for socks over stockings
    - Long foot size relative to calf size
    - Regular podiatry appointments

- **Usage Guidelines**:
  - Remove stockings at bedtime; can wear continuously for up to 7 days if needed.
  - Replace every 3–6 months; re-measure leg each time.
