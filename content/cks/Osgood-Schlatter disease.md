## Osgood-Schlatter Disease: Quick Revision Guide

### Definition
- **Osgood-Schlatter Disease**: Apophysitis of the tibial tuberosity causing anterior knee pain in adolescents; typically self-limiting.

### Causes
- **Repetitive Strain**: From patellar tendon at its insertion on the tibial tuberosity's ossification center.

### Risk Factors
- **Age**: Occurs during growth spurts in adolescence.
- **Sporting Activity**: Involves running, jumping, and repetitive knee bending.
- **Biomechanical Factors**: 
  - Quadriceps muscle tightness
  - Reduced hamstring flexibility

### Symptoms
- **Knee Pain**: 
  - Typically unilateral; both knees affected in ~30% of cases.
  - Develops earlier in girls (8-12 years) than boys (12-15 years).
  - Initially mild, may progress to severe and continuous pain.
  - Fluctuates with activity (exacerbated by running, jumping, kneeling).
  - Improves with rest and skeletal maturity.
  - Resolves in 90% of cases within weeks to months; may persist for 1-2 years.
  - 10% of individuals may experience symptoms into adulthood, leading to chronic pain and reduced sports participation.

### Examination Findings
- **Tenderness**: Over tibial tuberosity, provoked by knee extension against resistance.
- **Swelling/Bony Enlargement**: Of the tibial tuberosity.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Features**: Diagnosis can be made based on symptoms if no other knee pain causes are evident.
- **Alternative Diagnosis**: Suspect if:
  - Pain starts suddenly after trauma.
  - Associated with systemic symptoms (fever, malaise).
  - Bone/joint pain at other sites.
  - Persists at night or after rest.
  - Abnormal hip/knee joint examination.
- **X-rays**: Routine knee X-ray not recommended for diagnosis.

### Management Strategies
- **Analgesia**: Paracetamol and/or NSAIDs.
- **Protective Gear**: Knee pads for pain relief during kneeling.
- **Ice Application**: Intermittent over tibial tuberosity.
- **Exercise Modification**: Advice on modifying activities and stretching exercises.

### Further Assessment
- **Re-evaluation**: For worsening or unresponsive knee pain.
- **Referral**:
  - To a pediatrician or orthopedic surgeon for diagnostic uncertainty.
  - To a physiotherapist if needed.
  - To an orthopedic surgeon for adults with persistent symptoms affecting function.
