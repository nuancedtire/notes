## Chickenpox Summary

- **Definition**: Acute infectious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus, primarily affecting children.
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Vesicular rash
  - Fever and malaise
- **Transmission**: 
  - Personal contact or droplet spread
  - Incubation period: 1–3 weeks
- **Infectious Period**: 24 hours before rash appears until vesicles are dry or crusted (approximately 5 days after rash onset).
- **Virus Persistence**: Remains in sensory nerve ganglia; can reactivate as herpes zoster (shingles).

### Complications:
- **Common in young children**: Bacterial skin infections
- **More common in adults**: Lung involvement
- **In pregnancy**: 
  - Severe maternal chickenpox
  - Fetal varicella syndrome
  - Neonatal chickenpox infection in later pregnancy
- **In immunocompromised individuals**: 
  - Severe disseminated chickenpox
  - Varicella pneumonia, encephalitis, hepatitis, and hemorrhagic complications

### Clinical Features:
- **Prodromal Symptoms**: 
  - Nausea, myalgia, anorexia, headache, malaise, loss of appetite
- **Rash Development**: 
  - Small erythematous macules on scalp, face, trunk, proximal limbs
  - Progression to papules, clear vesicles (intensely itchy), and pustules
  - Vesicles may appear on palms, soles, and mucous membranes; can cause painful oral/genital ulcers
  - Vesicles appear in crops; crusting occurs within 5 days and falls off in 1–2 weeks

### Diagnosis and Management:
- **Laboratory Tests**: Rarely needed in primary care.
- **Hospital Admission**: Required for suspected serious complications (e.g., severe skin infections, pneumonia, encephalitis, dehydration).
- **Specialist Advice**: Needed for pregnant women, neonates, immunocompromised individuals, and breastfeeding women regarding treatment.

### Treatment:
- **Antiviral Treatment**: Consider for immunocompetent adults/adolescents (14+ years) within 24 hours of rash onset, especially if severe or at risk of complications.
- **Symptomatic Treatment**: 
  - Paracetamol
  - Topical calamine lotion
  - Chlorphenamine (avoid in certain groups: pregnant/breastfeeding women, children <1 year)
- **Advice**: Provide guidance on contact with others and when to seek further medical advice.
