## Warts and Verrucae Summary

- **Definition**: Cutaneous warts are small, rough growths caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection in keratinocytes.
- **Common Locations**: Anywhere on the skin, particularly on hands and feet.
- **Types of Warts**:
  - **Verruca (Plantar Wart)**: Wart on the sole of the foot.
  - **Common Warts**: Firm, raised, rough surface (usually on knuckles, knees, fingers).
  - **Periungual Warts**: Around nails; can disturb nail growth and may be painful.
  - **Plane Warts**: Round, flat-topped, skin-colored or greyish yellow (common on backs of hands).
  - **Filiform Warts**: Finger-like appearance, may have a stalk (common on face and neck).
  - **Palmar/Plantar Warts**: Grow on palms/soles; often have central dark dots and may be painful.
  - **Mosaic Warts**: Coalescence of palmar or plantar warts into larger plaques.

- **Incidence**: 
  - Common at any age; rare in infants and very young children.
  - Peak incidence during adolescence and early adulthood, declining in later adulthood.

- **Transmission**: 
  - Direct skin-to-skin contact or indirectly via contaminated surfaces (e.g., swimming pools).

- **Prognosis**: 
  - Can clear spontaneously or persist for years; generally more rapid resolution in children.
  - Benign in immunocompetent individuals, rarely undergo malignant change.

- **Diagnosis**: Based on typical appearance.

- **Management**: 
  - Often resolve without treatment; may offer advice on reducing transmission risk.
  - Treatment considered if wart is painful, cosmetically unappealing, persistent, or requested.

- **Treatment Options for Non-Facial Warts**:
  - **Adults/Older Children**: Topical salicylic acid, cryotherapy, or both (cryotherapy not for younger children).
  
- **When to Refer to Dermatologist**:
  - Uncertain diagnosis.
  - Facial wart.
  - Multiple recalcitrant warts with compromised immunity.
  - Extensive warts.
  - Persistent warts unresponsive to primary care treatments.
