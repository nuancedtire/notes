**Epidemiology:**

**Assessment:**
- Inquire about:

  - Exacerbating/relieving factors.
  - Red flags for serious illness.
  - Antenatal and birth history.
  - Birth weight and growth patterns.
  - Feeding/sleeping habits and winding techniques.
  - Parent/carer coping strategies and family impact.
  - Parental atopy, smoking, alcohol use, breastfeeding issues.
- Conduct a physical examination for:
  - Red flag signs suggesting serious illness.
  - Serial weight measurements.
  - Orofacial conditions affecting feeding.
  - Muscle tone and neurological signs.
  - Parent/carer interaction with the infant.

**Management:**
- Provide information and support resources.
- Reassure parents about normal crying and suggest strategies:
  - Holding the baby, gentle motion, white noise, optimal winding techniques.
- Encourage parental self-care (rest, support, 'time out').

- Advise against certain non-recommended strategies.
- Plan follow-up based on clinical judgement.

**Referral Criteria:**
