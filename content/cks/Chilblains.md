## Chilblains Summary

- **Definition**: Chilblains (perniosis) are cold-induced inflammatory lesions affecting skin areas vulnerable to cold (fingers, toes, nose, ears).

- **Classification**:
  - **Acute Chilblains**: Develops within 12–24 hours of cold exposure; resolves in 2–3 weeks if further exposure is avoided.
  - **Chronic Chilblains**: Persistent lesions from repeated cold exposure; may lead to scarring and atrophy.

- **Etiology**: Caused by prolonged or intermittent cold-induced vasoconstriction of deep cutaneous arterioles and dilatation of superficial vessels in susceptible individuals.

- **Types**:
  - **Primary (Idiopathic)**: No underlying condition.
  - **Secondary**: Associated with underlying conditions (connective tissue or hematological disorders).

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Family history
  - Peripheral vascular disease
  - Low body weight or poor nutrition

- **Complications**:
  - Skin excoriation from scratching
  - Secondary infection from blisters or scratches
  - Ulceration
  - Permanent discoloration
  - Scarring

- **Diagnosis**: 
  - Clinical diagnosis based on recent cold exposure and characteristic lesions (red–purple macular, papular, or nodular) on acral skin.
  - Associated symptoms: pruritus or burning discomfort; may be asymptomatic.
  - Normal arterial circulation and peripheral sensation.

- **Further Investigation**: Required if underlying cause is suspected or diagnosis is in doubt.

- **Management**:
  - **Idiopathic Chilblains**: Self-limiting; reassurance provided.
  - **Advice**:
    - Drying and gradually warming skin (avoid direct heat).
    - Avoid smoking (if applicable).
    - Prevent cold, damp conditions.
    - Wear adequate clothing (warm gloves and socks).
  - **Drug Treatment**: Not routinely prescribed; consider for severe chronic cases or recurrent severe episodes. 
    - Modified-release nifedipine (off-label) may be an option, but evidence is limited and conflicting.
