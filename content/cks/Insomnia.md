### Assessment

- **Comorbidities**: Consider other sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnoea, restless legs syndrome, parasomnias).
- **Evaluation**: Thorough history and identification of contributory factors.
- **Sleep Diary**: Keep for 1-2 weeks to identify patterns and lifestyle factors.

### Management

- **Good Sleep Hygiene**: Recommended for all with insomnia; involves awareness of behavioral, environmental, and temporal factors.
- **Medications**: 
  - Avoid hypnotics if possible due to potential adverse effects.
  - For short-term insomnia with severe daytime impairment:
    - Consider a short course (3-7 days) of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics (z-drugs).
    - Caution in older adults.

- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi)**:
  - Recommended first-line for both short- and long-term insomnia.
  - Benefits persist post-treatment.
  - Digitally delivered treatment (e.g., Sleepio) recommended by NICE.

- **Chronic Insomnia Treatment**:
  - CBTi as first-line treatment for all ages.
  - Sleepio may also be offered.
  - Avoid long-term pharmacological therapy.

- **Referral**: To a sleep clinic or neurology if:
  - Another sleep disorder is suspected.
  - Diagnosis is uncertain.
  - Long-term insomnia does not respond to primary care management.
