## Vitiligo: Summary

- **Definition**: Vitiligo is a chronic depigmentation disorder characterized by selective loss of melanocytes, resulting in chalky white skin and sometimes hair.

- **Classification**:
  - **Non-segmental vitiligo** (more common)
    - Generalized: Bilateral, symmetrical macules or patches distributed randomly over the body, often in pressure/friction areas.
    - Focal: Isolated depigmented lesions without a specific pattern.
    - Acrofacial: Depigmented macules on distal extremities and/or face, particularly around orifices.
    - Mucosal: Located on oral and/or genital mucosa.
    - Universal: Nearly complete depigmentation, usually follows generalized vitiligo.
    - Follicular: Depigmented body hairs.
    - Mixed: Co-existence of segmental and non-segmental forms.
    - Unclassified: Isolated mucosal involvement or persistent focal vitiligo.
  
  - **Segmental vitiligo** (less common)
    - Typically has earlier onset and dermatomal distribution (affects one or more dermatomes).
    - Usually unilateral and limited to one segment.

- **Pathogenesis**: Unknown; potential triggers include stress, skin trauma (Koebner phenomenon), and chemical exposure.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Family history of vitiligo
  - Personal/family history of autoimmune diseases (e.g., thyroid disease)

- **Prognosis**: Dependent on age, subtype, distribution, activity, and extent; low likelihood of spontaneous repigmentation for most individuals.

- **Assessment**:
  - History: Extent, duration, spread of lesions, quality of life impact, triggers/risk factors, previous episodes/treatments.
  - Physical examination: Determine disease subtype, assess skin type, estimate affected body surface area.
  - Consider blood tests for autoimmune diseases (e.g., thyroid function tests) if non-segmental vitiligo is suspected.

- **Management**:
  - Provide information and support resources.
  - Advise on sun protection.
  - Manage psychosocial co-morbidities.
  - Offer short-term potent topical corticosteroids for adults with localized, non-facial non-segmental vitiligo (if no contraindications).
  - Regular reviews to assess treatment response and monitor adverse effects.
  - Further investigation/referral for associated autoimmune diseases as needed.
  - Referral to a dermatologist for uncertain diagnosis or ineffective primary care treatment.
  - Referral to skin camouflage services if appropriate.
