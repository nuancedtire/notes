## Impetigo Summary

- **Definition**: Impetigo is a common, superficial, and highly contagious bacterial skin infection.

- **Types**:
  - **Non-bullous Impetigo** (70% of cases)
    - Caused by: *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Streptococcus pyogenes*, or both.
  - **Bullous Impetigo**
    - Caused by: *Staphylococcus aureus*.

- **Resistance**: Increasing cases of impetigo caused by Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

- **Affected Population**: 
  - All age groups, most common in young children.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Conditions leading to skin breaks (cuts, burns, insect bites, eczema, contact dermatitis)
  - Warm/humid weather
  - Poor hygiene
  - Crowded environments

- **Prognosis**:
  - Self-limiting; heals in 7â€“21 days without treatment.
  - Antibiotic treatment can speed up healing and reduce infective period.

- **Complications**: Rare but can include glomerulonephritis and cellulitis, especially in neonates and immunosuppressed individuals.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Primarily clinical.
  - **Non-bullous Impetigo**: Thin-walled vesicles or pustules that rupture, forming golden-brown crusts. Common sites: face (nose and mouth), limbs, flexures (especially axillae).
  - **Bullous Impetigo**: Large, fragile bullae that rupture and ooze yellow fluid, leaving a scaley rim. Common sites: flexures, face, trunk, limbs.
  - Differential diagnoses to exclude: chicken pox, eczema, cellulitis.
  - Consider swabs for culture and sensitivities if persistent, recurrent, or widespread.

- **Management**:
  - Hygiene measures to aid healing and prevent spread.
  - Exclusion from settings (school, work) until lesions are healed, dry, and crusted, or 48 hours post-treatment initiation.
  - Optimal treatment of pre-existing skin conditions (e.g., eczema).
  - Treatment options:
    - Hydrogen peroxide 1% cream.
    - Topical antibiotics (fusidic acid 2% or mupirocin 2% if resistance is suspected).
    - Oral antibiotics depending on infection type and extent.
  - Reassess if symptoms worsen or do not improve after treatment.
  - Consider admission, referral, or specialist advice based on:
    - Suspected sepsis.
    - Widespread infection in immunosuppressed individuals.
    - Suspected MRSA (consult local microbiologist).
