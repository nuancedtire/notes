## Sciatica (Lumbar Radiculopathy) Summary

### Definition
- **Sciatica**: Radiating leg pain due to inflammation or compression of lumbosacral nerve roots (L4â€“S1) forming the sciatic nerve.

### Symptoms
- **Pain**: Sudden or slow onset, varying severity; felt in back/buttock, radiates down the leg below the knee into the foot/toes.
- **Other Symptoms**: Tingling, numbness, loss of muscle strength in the affected leg.

### Causes of Nerve Root Compression
1. **Herniated Intervertebral Disc**: ~90% of cases.
2. Spondylolisthesis.
3. Spinal stenosis.
4. Infection.
5. Cancer.

### Modifiable Risk Factors
- Smoking.
- Obesity.
- Occupational factors (e.g., whole-body vibration, strenuous activity).
- General health.

### Other Risk Factors
- Older age.
- Genetic influences.

### Course of Condition
- **Episodic**: Usually transient; improvements in pain/disability within weeks to months.
- **Recurrence**: Common.

### Assessment
- **Components**:
  - Medical history.
  - Psychosocial assessment.
  - Focused musculoskeletal and neurological examination.
  - Identify red flags and exclude differential diagnoses.

### Signs and Symptoms Indicating Sciatica
- Unilateral leg pain radiating below the knee to foot/toes.
- Low back pain (less severe than leg pain).
- Numbness/tingling (paraesthesia) in nerve root distribution.
- Weakness or reflex changes in myotomal distribution.
- Positive straight leg raise test.

### Red Flags
- Bowel/bladder dysfunction (e.g., urinary retention).
- Progressive neurological weakness.
- Saddle anaesthesia.
- Bilateral radiculopathy.
- Localised tenderness.
- Incapacitating or progressive pain.
- Unrelenting night pain.
- Use of steroids or intravenous drugs.

### Serious Conditions Overlapping with Sciatica
- Cauda equina syndrome.
- Spinal fracture.
- Cancer.
- Infection.

### Management Strategies
1. **Urgent Referral**: For individuals with red flag symptoms suggesting serious causes.
2. **STarT Back Tool**: For stratified management in absence of red flags.
3. **Self-Management Advice**: For all sciatica patients.
4. **Follow-Up**: Seek if symptoms worsen, persist over 2 weeks, severe pain not subsiding in 1 week, new symptoms develop, or recurrence occurs.
5. **Referrals**: 
   - Group exercise programs.
   - Physiotherapy for manual therapy.
   - Psychological therapies for higher-risk patients.
6. **Facilitation**: Promote return to work and daily activities.

### Management of Persistent or Worsening Symptoms
- **Reassessment**.
- **Combined Program**: Physical and psychological therapy incorporating cognitive behavioral approach.
- **Refer Where Appropriate**.
