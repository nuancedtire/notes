## Corticosteroids - Inhaled: Summary

### Overview
- **Corticosteroids**: Synthetic analogues of adrenal cortex hormones with mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid properties.
- **Inhaled corticosteroids**: Potent anti-inflammatory agents that manage asthma by targeting both immediate and late inflammatory phases.

### Mechanism of Action
- Decrease cytokine formation (inflammatory mediators).
- Reduce microvascular permeability.
- Inhibit eosinophil influx to the lungs.
- Lower bronchial hyper-responsiveness.

### Delivery Method
- Directly inhaled into the lungs using various devices.
- Reduced systemic absorption minimizes adverse effects compared to oral corticosteroids.

### Common Inhaled Corticosteroids in the UK
- **Beclometasone dipropionate**: Aerosol and dry powder inhaler.
- **Budesonide**: Dry powder inhaler and nebulization units.
- **Ciclesonide**: Aerosol inhaler.
- **Fluticasone propionate**: Various inhaler forms.
- **Mometasone furoate**: Dry powder inhaler.

### Efficacy and Potency
- Similar efficacy and adverse effect profiles across inhaled corticosteroids.
- **Qvar and Kelhale**: Contain extrafine particles, twice as potent as other beclometasone inhalers.

### Prescribing Considerations
- Avoid generic prescribing to ensure consistency in inhaler devices and adherence.
- No contraindications for inhaled corticosteroids, but caution in certain infections (tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral, ocular herpes simplex).

### Safety in Special Populations
- Safe for use during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

### Local Adverse Effects
- Oral candidiasis, sore mouth, dysphonia, hoarseness (especially at high doses).
- Paradoxical bronchospasm.

### Rare Systemic Adverse Effects
- Adrenal suppression, reduced bone mineral density, bruising, cataracts, glaucoma.
- Growth suppression in children (final adult height typically unaffected).
- Rare cases of adrenal crisis, coma, and death in children.
- Psychological and behavioral changes.
- Increased susceptibility to infections.

### Minimizing Adverse Effects
- Titrate to the lowest effective dose.
- Avoid rapid dose reduction after long-term use.
- Consider large-volume spacer with pMDI for high doses.
- Advise mouth rinsing after inhaler use.
- Carry a steroid treatment card for long-term high-dose users.
- Regular height monitoring in children using inhaled corticosteroids.
