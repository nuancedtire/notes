- **Definition**: 
  - A laceration is a deep cut or tear in the skin and/or underlying tissue.
  - Common causes: blunt trauma (falls, collisions), sharp object incisions, mammalian bites.

- **Complications**: 
  - Infection is the most common complication.
  - Possible deeper structure injuries: nerves, blood vessels, muscles, bones, tendons.

- **Infection Risk Factors**: 
  - Contamination with soil, feces, body fluids, or pus.
  - Diabetes, increasing age, stellate shape or jagged wound margins.
  - Wound length > 5 cm.

- **Assessment**:
  - Obtain detailed history: time, cause of injury, past medical history, allergies, tetanus vaccine history.
  - Examine size, shape, and location of the wound.
  - Assess for deeper structure injuries and signs/symptoms of infection.

- **Primary Care Management**:
  - Clean, close, and dress low infection risk wounds.
  - For infected/high-risk wounds: clean and dress first; close after 2â€“5 days if no infection signs.
  - Consider antibiotics; take a wound swab before treatment.
  - Assess need for tetanus prophylaxis for wounds exposed to soil or contaminants.
  - Provide information/advice: pain relief (paracetamol/ibuprofen), keep wound clean and dry, seek medical help for infection signs.
  - Arrange follow-up for wound closure or removal.

- **Hospital Admission Criteria**:
  - Severe infection or systemic illness.
  - Signs/symptoms of tetanus (generalized rigidity, muscle spasms).

- **Referral to A&E Recommended for**:
  - Lack of expertise in primary care.
  - Possible vascular, nerve, tendon, or bone damage.
  - Facial laceration crossing lips, nose, or ears.
  - Laceration of palm with signs of infection.
  - Associated cellulitis over a joint.
  - Significant wound contamination.
  - Possible foreign body in wound post-cleaning (including glass injuries).
  - Complex, gaping, or extensively devitalized lacerations.
  - Significant tissue loss or inability to close wound edges.
  - Unsuitable local anesthesia (e.g., in children or needle-phobic patients).
  - High-risk tetanus-prone wounds.
