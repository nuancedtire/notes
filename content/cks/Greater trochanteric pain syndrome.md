### Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome: Quick Revision

#### Definition
- A regional pain syndrome characterized by chronic intermittent pain around the greater trochanter (lateral hip).

#### Terminology
- Previously known as "trochanteric bursitis"; now termed "greater trochanteric pain syndrome" to reflect that bursae play a smaller role than previously thought, and inflammation is not always present.

#### Causes
- Inflammation or trauma in muscles, tendons, fascia, or bursae.

#### Demographics
- More common in women, especially aged 40–60 years.
- Often coexists with conditions like:
  - Low back pain
  - Knee osteoarthritis
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
  - Fibromyalgia

#### Prognosis
- Over 90% recover fully with conservative treatment (rest, pain relief, physiotherapy, corticosteroid injection).
- Poorer outcome risk factors:
  - Higher initial pain intensity
  - Longer pain duration
  - Greater movement restriction
  - Higher functional impairment
  - Older age

#### Diagnosis
- Based on clinical features:
  - Lateral hip pain aggravated by activity
  - Point tenderness near the greater trochanter
- Assess pain location, radiation, nature, onset, and aggravating/relieving factors.
- Exclude alternative diagnoses (e.g., sports hernia, osteoarthritis, lumbar nerve root compression, bursa infection).

#### Management
- Reassurance: condition usually self-limiting.
- Activity modification: avoid movements worsening pain (e.g., repetitive hip movements, lying on the affected hip).
- Symptom relief: ice packs (10–20 mins several times a day), analgesics (paracetamol, ibuprofen).
- Lifestyle advice: weight loss, smoking cessation if appropriate.
- If conservative treatment fails, consider:
  - Peri-trochanteric corticosteroid injection
  - Referral to physiotherapy

#### Referral Guidelines
- **Emergency Referral** for:
  - Hip pain with systemic symptoms
  - Signs of infection
  - Known malignancy with suspicion of fracture
  - Sudden inability to bear weight
  - History of a fall
  
- **Urgent Orthopaedics Referral** for:
  - Severe pain unresponsive to analgesia
  - Persistent loss of function

- **General Orthopaedics Referral** for:
  - Patients under 40 with persistent hip pain affecting daily activities, unresponsive to 3 months of physiotherapy.
  - Painful, irritable, and stiff hip interfering with sleep and daily activities not controlled by conservative measures.

- **Secondary Care Referral** if:
  - Symptoms related to previous hip surgery or fractured femur.
  - Diagnosis is uncertain.
  - Lack of expertise in peri-trochanteric injection in primary care.
  - No response to corticosteroid injection or physiotherapy.
