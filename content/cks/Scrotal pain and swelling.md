## Summary of Scrotal Pain and Swelling

### Possible Causes
- **Testicular torsion**: Suspect in acute scrotal pain/swelling.
- **Testicular cancer**
- **Squamous cell carcinoma of the scrotum**
- **Indirect inguinal hernia**
- **Epididymo-orchitis**: Includes epididymitis and orchitis.
- **Haematocele**
- **Epididymal cyst or spermatocele**
- **Hydrocele**
- **Varicocele**

### Assessment
- **History Taking**:
  - Nature of pain: location, onset, radiation, duration, severity, exacerbating factors.
  - Associated swelling or mass: previous episodes, systemic symptoms.
  - Sexual history, trauma history, previous surgeries, UTI, urethral discharge.
  
- **Examination**:
  - Inspect scrotum and inguinal region: swelling, testicular lie, size, symmetry, tenderness.
  - Assess swelling consistency, transillumination, abdominal mass/lymphadenopathy, fever, skin changes.

- **Investigations**:
  - STIs if indicated.
  - UTI if clinically relevant.
  - **Urgent ultrasound** if:
    - Diagnostic uncertainty.
    - Persistent unexplained testicular symptoms.
    - Unclear scrotal swelling origin.
    - Hydrocele in ages 18-40 (risk of cancer).
    - Trauma history with pain (possible haematocele/testicular rupture).
    - Chronic or non-trauma-related haematocele (may require surgery).

### Management
- **Emergency Admission**:
  - Suspected testicular torsion.
  - Serious complications from inguinal hernia (strangulation, obstruction) or acute epididymo-orchitis (sepsis, abscess).
  - Haematocele following acute trauma.
  
- **Referrals**:
  - **Urgent urology referral** (2-week wait) for suspected testicular cancer.
  - **Urgent urology/dermatology referral** (2-week wait) for suspected squamous cell carcinoma of the scrotum.
  - **Local sexual health clinic** for suspected acute epididymo-orchitis due to STI; otherwise, manage in primary care.
  - **Paediatric surgery/urology referral** for congenital/non-congenital hydrocele, based on age, size, and symptoms.
