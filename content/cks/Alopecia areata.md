## Alopecia Areata Summary

- **Definition**: Chronic, inflammatory condition affecting hair follicles, leading to sudden non-scarring alopecia (hair loss with preserved hair follicles).
- **Common Areas Affected**: Scalp, beard; less frequently, eyebrows and eyelashes.
- **Types of Hair Loss**:
  - **Alopecia Totalis**: Total scalp hair loss.
  - **Alopecia Universalis**: Total scalp and body hair loss.
- **Nail Changes**: Observed in 10-15% of cases.
- **Pathophysiology**: Premature conversion of hair from growth (anagen) to loss (telogen) phase; believed to involve autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors.
- **Incidence**: Estimated lifetime incidence of around 2%; affects both genders equally and can occur at any age.
- **Age of Onset**: Most commonly in the second and third decades of life.
- **Prognosis**: Unpredictable; spontaneous remission in up to 50% of cases within one year, especially with limited patches; further episodes are common; more extensive initial hair loss correlates with poorer prognosis.

### Diagnosis

  - Patchy hair loss with circular or oval areas.
  - Possible presence of exclamation mark hairs (short broken hairs tapering proximally).
