- **Roundworm Overview**  
  - Common intestinal worm: *Ascaris lumbricoides*  
  - Transmission: Faeco-oral route (ingestion of eggs in contaminated soil, food, or water)  
  - Prevalence: Tropical and subtropical areas (Africa, China, South East Asia, Central and South America)  
  - Rare in the UK; typically acquired abroad  

- **Symptoms**  
  - Often asymptomatic or mild non-specific symptoms  
  - Symptoms vary with worm burden  
  - Heavy infections can lead to significant morbidity and mortality  
  - Possible complications: intestinal obstruction (life-threatening)  

- **Diagnosis**  
  - Consider in returning travelers or migrants from endemic areas with non-specific abdominal or respiratory symptoms  
  - Clinical examination: check vital signs, abdominal and respiratory systems  
  - Confirmed by stool sample  
  - Different helminth infections (e.g., schistosomiasis, filariasis) require different tests  

- **Management in Primary Care**  
  - Urgent admission for potential complications (intestinal/biliary obstruction)  
  - Consult specialist for systemic symptoms (e.g., pneumonitis)  
  - Prescribe anthelmintic (mebendazole unless contraindicated) for confirmed uncomplicated cases  
  - Consult specialist for treatment in children, pregnant, or breastfeeding women  
  - Advise on hygiene measures to prevent re-infection (e.g., hand washing after toilet use and before food preparation)
