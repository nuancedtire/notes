## Tennis Elbow: Summary

- **Definition**: Tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis) is tendinosis affecting the extensor muscles' tendons at the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.

- **Symptoms**:
  - Pain at the lateral epicondyle, radiating down the forearm.
  - Difficulty with activities like raising a cup, shaking hands, shaving, or lifting bags with an extended elbow.
  - Symptoms worsen with excessive, repetitive use of forearm extensor muscles.

- **Common Activities Causing Symptoms**:
  - Construction work
  - Assembly line work
  - Use of vibratory tools
  - Typing
  - Playing piano
  - Playing tennis
  - Kayaking

- **Other Names**: Lateral elbow pain, rowing elbow, tendonitis of the common extensor origin, peri-tendinitis of the elbow.

- **Etiology**:
  - Often follows minor or unrecognized trauma to the forearm extensors.
  - Repetitive overuse leads to micro-tears in the common extensor tendon.

- **Demographics**:
  - Affects women and men equally.
  - Peak incidence: Ages 35â€“54.

- **Prognosis**: 
  - Generally self-limiting; 80-90% improve within 1-2 years.
  - Symptoms often insidious; may follow an injury or increased activity.

- **Examination Findings**:
  - Localized tenderness over the lateral epicondyle and common extensor tendon.
  - Pain on resisted middle finger extension.
  - Pain on resisted wrist extension.
  - Reduced grip strength due to pain.
  - Full active and passive movement at elbow and wrist joints preserved.

- **Initial Management**:
  - Apply heat or ice for pain relief.
  - Rest the arm; avoid aggravating activities for 6 weeks.
  - Consider using an orthosis (forearm strap, wrist or elbow brace).
  - Offer analgesia (paracetamol or NSAIDs).
  - Provide information and advice.

- **If Symptoms Persist**:
  - Reassess and consider alternative diagnoses.
  - Refer to physiotherapy.
  - Corticosteroid injection for severe pain; may provide short-term relief.

- **Referral to Orthopaedic Surgeon** if:
  - Diagnosis is uncertain.
  - There is refractory pain or severe functional impairment.
  - Symptoms persist despite 6-12 months of optimal primary care management.
