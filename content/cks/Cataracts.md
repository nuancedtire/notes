## Cataracts: Quick Revision Guide

### Definition
- **Cataract**: Cloudy area in the lens of the eye that reduces transparency. Can occur in one or both eyes.

### Causes
- **Aging**: Most common in individuals over 60.
- **Trauma**: Injury or eye surgery.
- **Eye Diseases**: 
  - Chronic anterior uveitis
  - Acute congestive angle-closure glaucoma
  - High myopia
  - Retinitis pigmentosa
  - Leber congenital amaurosis
  - Gyrate atrophy
  - Stickler syndrome
- **Systemic Diseases**: 
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Myotonic dystrophy
  - Neurofibromatosis type 2
  - Severe atopic dermatitis
- **Congenital/Developmental**: Present in children.

### Risk Factors
- Family history of age-related cataracts
- Corticosteroid treatment
- Smoking
- Prolonged UVB light exposure

### Consequences of Untreated Cataracts
- Severe visual impairment.
- In babies: 
  - Untreated congenital cataracts lead to deprivation amblyopia.
  - Visual outcomes post-surgery are variable.

### Symptoms
- **Adults**:
  - Gradual, painless reduction in visual acuity (difficulty reading, recognizing faces, watching TV).
  - Glare: Difficulty in bright light (e.g., sunshine, night driving).
  
- **Babies/Children**:
  - Poor vision (suspected by parents).
  - White or grey pupil (leukocoria).
  - Involuntary eye movements (nystagmus).
  - Squint (strabismus).
  - Light sensitivity or glare problems.

### Examination Findings
- Reduced visual acuity.
- Opacity seen in lens with an ophthalmoscope (varies from small dot to complete opacification).
- Reduced or obliterated red reflex.

### Referral and Assessment
- **Adults**: 
  - Eye examination by an optometrist for:
    - Visual acuity assessment (with/without corrective lenses).
    - Exclusion of other visual impairment causes.
  
- **Surgery Discussion**:
  - Impact of cataract on vision and quality of life.
  - Affected eyes (one or both).
  - Surgery details including risks and benefits.
  - Quality of life considerations if surgery is declined.
  
- **Babies/Children**: 
  - Urgent referral to an ophthalmologist for suspected cataracts.
