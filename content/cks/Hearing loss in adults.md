## Hearing Loss in Adults: Quick Revision

### Overview
- Common condition, can occur at any age.
- Types: 
  - **Temporary or permanent**
  - **Onset**: Sudden (within 72 hours) or slowly progressive.

### Classification
1. **Conductive Hearing Loss**: 
   - Caused by abnormalities in the outer/middle ear.
   - Impairs conduction of sound waves to the cochlea.
  
2. **Sensorineural Hearing Loss**: 
   - Caused by abnormalities in the cochlea, auditory nerve, or neural pathways.

### Severity 
- Categorized as mild, moderate, severe, or profound based on quietest sound heard (measured in decibels).

### Common Causes
- Aging
- Excessive noise exposure

### Complications
- Reduced quality of life
- Social withdrawal
- Decreased educational and job opportunities
- Anxiety and depression
- Increased risk of dementia and falls

### Assessment
1. **History Taking**:
   - Symptoms noticed by whom?
   - Onset, characteristics, duration
   - Unilateral or bilateral?
   - Associated symptoms
   - Impact on daily functioning and emotional wellbeing
   - Underlying causes, comorbidities, family history
   - Current or past ototoxic medications

2. **Examination**:
   - Hearing assessment
   - Otoscopy of pinna, ear canal, tympanic membrane for underlying causes
   - Cranial nerves and cerebellar signs
   - Head and neck examination for masses

3. **Tests**:
   - Tuning fork tests for symmetrical hearing loss, distinguish between conductive and sensorineural.

### Referral Guidelines
- **Immediate ENT/Emergency Referral**:
  - Sudden-onset within 30 days, unexplained by external/middle ear causes.
  - Unilateral with focal neurology.
  - Associated with head/neck injury.
  - Potentially serious infective cause.

- **Urgent ENT Referral**:
  - Sudden-onset >30 days, rapidly progressive, unexplained by external/middle ear causes.

- **Urgent Cancer Pathway Referral**:
  - Suspected head or neck malignancy with hearing loss.

- **Routine ENT Referral**:
  - Unilateral/asymmetric gradual onset.
  - Fluctuating, not linked to URTI.
  - Associated with hyperacusis, tinnitus, or vertigo.
  - Not age-related.

- **Routine Audiology Referral**:
  - Suspected sensorineural hearing loss needing no specialist assessment.

### Management in Primary Care
- Exclude/manage underlying causes (e.g., impacted earwax, infections).
- Consider ENT referral if tympanic membrane examination is incomplete or clinically indicated.
- Provide information and support resources.
- Signpost to other services.
- Advise on auditory rehabilitation strategies.
