## Pressure Ulcers: Quick Reference Guide

### Definition
- **Pressure Ulcer**: Localized damage to skin/underlying tissue from pressure or shear, often over bony prominences or related to medical devices.

### Severity
- Ranges from discolored skin to extensive wounds involving necrotic tissue, fascia, muscle, and bone.

### Risk Factors
- Reduced mobility
- Nutritional deficiency
- Older age
- Conditions causing inadequate blood flow (e.g., diabetes, peripheral vascular disease)

### Complications
- Pain
- Infection
- Increased mortality

### Risk Assessment
- Anyone can be at risk.
- Use validated risk assessment scales (e.g., Braden, PURPOSE T) to support clinical judgment.

### Diagnosis Indicators
- Skin damage over bony prominence with risk factors:
  - Non-blanchable erythema (may appear as color changes in darker skin)
  - Marked localized skin changes
  - Varying severity wounds at sites with significant unrelieved pressure

### Assessment
- Document surface area and depth of the pressure ulcer.
- Note presence of undermining.
- Categorize using a validated classification tool.
- Investigations are not for diagnosis but may be needed for uncertainty or to exclude other conditions (e.g., venous ulcers, osteomyelitis).

### Prevention
- Provide tailored information on pressure ulcers and risk reduction.
- Conduct skin assessments for at-risk individuals.
- Develop individualized care plans based on assessments:
  - Pressure relief needs
  - Mobility and repositioning ability
  - Comorbidities and preferences
- Use barrier preparations for moisture/incontinence concerns.

### Management
- Conduct a nutritional risk assessment.
- Consider pressure redistributing devices.
- Debride wound if indicated.
- Prescribe systemic antibiotics when necessary (consult microbiology specialists).
- Recommend appropriate wound dressings.
