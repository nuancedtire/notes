- **Insect Bites and Stings Overview**
  - **Types of Insect Bites**:
    - **Puncturing**: Mosquitos, bedbugs
    - **Lacerating**: Horseflies, midges
  - **Stinging Insects**: Bees, wasps inject venom via stinger.

- **Reaction Duration**:
  - Most bites: Resolve in hours.
  - Complications may persist (e.g., tick mouthparts retained).

- **Complications**:
  - Local skin trauma
  - Allergic reactions
  - Systemic toxicity (multiple stings)
  - Disease transmission (e.g., Lyme disease)
  - Secondary skin infections

- **Common Reactions**:
  - Minor local reactions: Last from hours to days.
  - Severe reactions: Large local reactions or anaphylaxis.

- **Immediate Actions**:
  - Urgent treatment for suspected systemic reactions (angio-oedema, anaphylaxis).
  - Face or mucous membrane stings: Risk of airway obstruction; seek emergency care.

- **Referral Considerations**:
  - Previous systemic allergic reaction to same insect.
  - Fever or persistent lesions from non-UK insects.
  - Unusual stings (tropical/subtropical insects).

- **Allergy Specialist**:
  - Referral for systemic reactions.
  - Discuss large local reactions.

- **General Management** (if admission not required):
  - **Tetanus prophylaxis**: Consider appropriateness.
  - **Stinger removal**: Quick scraping with fingernail/card.
  - **Tick removal**: Grasp close to skin, pull perpendicular.
  - **Clean area**: Cold compress for pain/swelling.
  - **Hygiene**: Advise avoiding scratching to prevent infection.
  - **Reassess**: If signs of infection or severe pain develop.

- **Infestation Advice**:
  - Source eradication (e.g., pest control for bedbugs).

- **Treatment Recommendations**:
  - **Transient local reactions**: Simple first aid; consider oral paracetamol/ibuprofen, topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines (limited evidence).
  - **Large local reactions**: Oral antihistamines and corticosteroids (off-label use, limited evidence).
  - **Secondary infections**: Treat cellulitis with oral antibiotics per local protocols; consider admission if severe.
