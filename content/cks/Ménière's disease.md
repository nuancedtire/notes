### Definition
- **Ménière's Disease**: Disorder of the inner ear.
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Episodes of vertigo
  - Fluctuating hearing loss
  - Tinnitus
  - Fullness in the affected ear

### Pathophysiology
- Unknown cause; may be linked to **endolymphatic hydrops** (increased endolymph pressure in the inner ear).

### Classification
- **Idiopathic form**: Ménière's disease
- **Identified cause**: Ménière's syndrome

### Incidence
- Uncommon cause of vertigo.

### Complications
- Risks include falls and negative psychological/social impacts.

### Diagnosis
#### Definitive Diagnosis Criteria:
1. Two or more spontaneous episodes of vertigo (20 min to 12 hours).
2. Documented low-to-medium frequency sensorineural hearing loss in one ear (at least once before, during, or after vertigo).
3. Fluctuating aural symptoms in the affected ear.
4. Not explained by alternative vestibular diagnosis.

#### Probable Diagnosis Criteria:
1. Two or more episodes of vertigo or dizziness (20 min to 24 hours).
2. Fluctuating aural symptoms in the affected ear.
3. Not explained by alternative vestibular diagnosis.

### Referral and Assessment
- Confirmation requires referral to an Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) consultant and formal audiology assessment.

### Management
- For frequent, sudden attacks:
  - Keep medication accessible.
  - Assess risks for activities (driving, swimming, operating machinery).
  
- **Acute Symptoms Relief**:
  - Consider prochlorperazine or antihistamines for nausea, vomiting, and vertigo.
  - Severe cases may need hospital admission for intravenous sedatives and fluids.

- **Long-term Management**:
  - Trial of betahistine to reduce attack frequency/severity.
