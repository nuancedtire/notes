## Bunions: Quick Revision Guide

### Definition
- **Bunion (Hallux Valgus)**: Deformity where the great toe (hallux) deviates laterally from the midline, leading to:
  - Medial prominence of the first metatarsal head
  - Possible inflammation of the overlying bursa and soft tissues

### Symptoms
- Altered joint mechanics
- Pain when walking or wearing shoes

### Predisposing Factors
- Poorly-fitting and constricting footwear
- Increasing age
- Female gender
- Family history
- Pes planus (loss of medial longitudinal arch) and other foot deformities
- Achilles tendon contracture and ligamentous laxity

### Prevalence
- Increases with age
- More common in women than men

### Complications
- Medial forefoot and/or first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint pain
- Difficulty finding comfortable footwear
- Callus or corn formation (e.g., under second MTP joint)
- Osteoarthritis of the first MTP joint (hallux rigidus)
- Impaired balance and increased risk of falls
- Subluxation or dislocation at the first or second MTP joint ('hammer toe')
- Skin breakdown and foot ulceration, risk of osteomyelitis

### Assessment
- **History Taking**:
  - Presence and duration of symptoms (pain, impact on walking/daily activities)
  - Difficulty with footwear, family history, neurovascular comorbidities, previous treatments
- **Physical Examination**:
  - Gait observation and lower leg alignment
  - Standing and seated examination (degree of hallux valgus, pes planus, skin quality, pain/tenderness, neurovascular status, joint movement)
  - Footwear type and wear patterns

### Management
- Provide information and support resources
- Advise self-care measures:
  - Footwear modification
  - Use of insoles, toe spacers, and/or bunion pads
  - Ice and/or analgesia for symptom relief
- Referral options:
  - Podiatry for footwear assessment, night splints, or orthosis
  - Local musculoskeletal service for exercises, stretches, and potential corticosteroid injection
- **Note**: Referral is not indicated for cosmetic or prophylactic reasons alone

### Surgical Referral Considerations
- Progressive symptoms and/or deformity
- Symptoms persist after three months of conservative treatment
- Second toe involvement
- Significant impact on daily functioning
- Inability to wear suitable footwear

### Urgent Referral Indications
- Impending or non-healing foot ulcer
- Suspected peripheral limb ischaemia
