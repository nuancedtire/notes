### NSAIDs - Prescribing Issues: Summary

- **Definitions:**
  - **NSAIDs**: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties.
  - **Mechanism**: Inhibit prostaglandin synthesis by reversibly inhibiting cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzymes.
    - **COX-1**: Produces prostaglandins for gastric mucosal integrity and platelet function; inhibition can cause gastrointestinal toxicity.
    - **COX-2**: Produces prostaglandins that mediate pain and inflammation; inhibition leads to anti-inflammatory effects.

- **Classification of NSAIDs:**
  - **Standard NSAIDs (Nonselective)**: Inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. Examples:
    - Ibuprofen
    - Indometacin
    - Mefenamic acid
    - Naproxen
    - Diclofenac, Etodolac, Meloxicam, Nabumetone (prefer COX-2)
  
  - **Coxibs**: COX-2 specific NSAIDs. Examples:
    - Celecoxib
    - Etoricoxib

- **Prescribing Considerations:**
  - Assess individual risk factors: contraindications, drug interactions, medical history, monitoring requirements.
  - Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.

- **Specific Patient Conditions:**
  - **Severe Heart Failure**: Avoid NSAIDs.
  - **Mild to Moderate Heart Failure**: 
    - Avoid COX-2 inhibitors, diclofenac, high-dose ibuprofen (≥2400 mg/day).
    - First-line: Standard NSAID (not diclofenac or high-dose ibuprofen); monitor closely. 
      - Ibuprofen up to 1200 mg/day or naproxen up to 1000 mg/day.
  - **Ischaemic Heart Disease/Cerebrovascular Disease/Peripheral Arterial Disease**: 
    - First-line: Ibuprofen up to 1200 mg/day or naproxen up to 1000 mg/day.
    - Avoid COX-2 inhibitors, diclofenac, high-dose ibuprofen.
  - **Severe Renal Impairment** (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²): Avoid NSAIDs if possible; monitor closely if used.
  - **Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease/Elderly**: 
    - First-line: Ibuprofen up to 1200 mg/day or naproxen up to 1000 mg/day.
  - **Uncontrolled Hypertension** (BP persistently > 140/90 mmHg): Avoid etoricoxib and high-dose ibuprofen.

- **Preventing GI Adverse Effects:**
  - Consider alternative analgesics.
  - Avoid prescribing more than one NSAID simultaneously.
  - Avoid concurrent use of an NSAID with low-dose aspirin.
  - Prefer short-acting NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen) over long-acting (e.g., naproxen).

- **GI Risk Management:**
  - **High Risk of GI Events**: Prescribe a COX-2 inhibitor with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
  - **Moderate Risk of GI Events**: Prescribe a COX-2 inhibitor alone or an NSAID plus a PPI.
  - **Low Risk of GI Events**: Prescribe a non-selective NSAID.
