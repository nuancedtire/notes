## Multiple Sclerosis Summary

- **Definition**: 
  - Acquired immune-mediated inflammatory condition of the CNS.
  - Results in demyelination, gliosis, and secondary neuronal damage.

- **Epidemiology**:
  - Common in young adults.
  - Leading non-traumatic cause of neurological disability in those under 40.

- **Disease Patterns**:
  1. **Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS)**:
     - Most common type.
     - Episodes of symptoms (relapses) followed by recovery (remissions).
     - Residual CNS damage after relapses.
  
  2. **Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS)**:
     - Gradual accumulation of disability unrelated to relapses.
     - About 2/3 of RRMS patients progress to SPMS.
  
  3. **Primary Progressive MS (PPMS)**:
     - Steady worsening from onset without remissions.
     - Affects 10-15% of MS patients.

- **Etiology**:
  - Unknown cause.
  - Immune-mediated inflammation triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals.
  - Contributing risk factors: 
    - Genetic predisposition
    - Vitamin D deficiency
    - Infections
    - Geographic location (latitude)
    - Smoking
    - Obesity in adolescence
    - Female gender

- **Common Symptoms**:
  - Optic neuritis
  - Transverse myelitis
  - Cerebellar symptoms
  - Brainstem syndromes

- **Natural History**:
  - Unpredictable course in RRMS; variability in severity and frequency of relapses.
  - Time to progress to SPMS and permanent disability varies.

- **Diagnosis and Management**:
  - Prompt referral to a consultant neurologist for diagnosis.
  - Blood tests to exclude other diagnoses; MRI should be deferred to specialist assessment.
  
- **Managing Relapses**:
  - Rule out infections (UTI and respiratory).
  - Assess for disease fluctuations and other conditions.
  - Contact MS team for management (e.g., oral methylprednisolone 0.5 g daily for 5 days).

- **Annual Review**:
  - Comprehensive review at least once a year in secondary care.

- **Complications**:
  - Fatigue
  - Spasticity
  - Ataxia
  - Tremor
  - Mobility issues
  - Visual problems
  - Pain
  - Bladder and sexual dysfunction
  - Mental health issues

- **Management of Complications**:
  - Various drug and non-drug therapies available for symptom management.
