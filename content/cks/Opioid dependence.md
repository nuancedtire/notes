- **Opioid Definition**: Natural derivatives of opium or synthetic/semi-synthetic substances acting on opioid receptors in the brain.

- **Development of Dependence**: 
  - Occurs after regular use; duration varies based on:
    - Quantity, frequency, and route of administration
    - Individual vulnerability
    - Context of drug use
  - Physical and psychological dependence can occur in 2â€“10 days of continuous use.

- **Key Elements of Opioid Dependence**:
  - Strong desire or compulsion to use opioids
  - Difficulty controlling use
  - Increasing priority of use over other activities
  - Evidence of tolerance
  - Persistence despite harmful consequences
  - Withdrawal symptoms upon cessation or reduction of use

- **Complications**:
  - Overdose (risk of death)
  - Infections (e.g., HIV, hepatitis from shared equipment)
  - Social issues (e.g., homelessness, crime)

- **Signs of Opioid Dependence**:
  - Requests for help
  - Complications related to illicit drug use
  - Clinical signs of intoxication or withdrawal
  - Relevant psychiatric, forensic, or social history
  - Symptoms like poor nutrition, needle tracks, or skin abscesses

- **Assessment and Management**:
  - Practitioners must assess and manage within their competence.
  - Initial assessment in primary care:
    - Confirm opioid dependence
    - Identify and address medical, mental health, or social issues
  - Follow local safeguarding policies if harm risk is identified.
  - Referral to specialist drug services recommended.

- **Advice and Specialist Management**:
  - Provide guidance on immunizations, harm reduction, driving regulations, and overdose prevention.
  - Treatment involves pharmacological and psychosocial approaches to enhance resilience and wellbeing, while reducing relapse risk.
  - Treatment pathways are tailored to individual goals, motivation, support systems, and preferences.

- **Psychosocial Interventions**: Aim to support behavioral change and build resilience.

- **Drug Treatment Options**:
  - Opioid agonist substitution treatment (OST) (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine) - first-line treatment
  - Opioid assisted withdrawal treatment
  - Opioid antagonist maintenance treatment

- **Follow-up Protocol**:
  - Daily visits during drug treatment initiation and titration (highest risk of death phase)
  - At least fortnightly visits thereafter; monthly or less if stable.
