## Cow's Milk Allergy in Children: Summary

### Definition
- **Cow's Milk Allergy**: Immune-mediated allergic response to cow's milk proteins.

### Classification
- **IgE-mediated Food Allergy**: 
  - Immediate symptoms (within 2 hours).
  - Affects multiple organ systems.
- **Non-IgE-mediated Food Allergy**: 
  - Symptoms appear 2-72 hours after ingestion.
- **Mixed IgE and Non-IgE Allergic Reactions**: 
  - Typically delayed.

### Epidemiology
- Common in early childhood.
- Almost all cases present before 1 year of age.

### Possible Complications
- Parental/carer stress and reduced quality of life.
- Restricted diet and malnutrition.
- Development of atopic comorbidities.
- Severe and life-threatening reactions.

### Resolution Rates
- Non-IgE-mediated allergy generally resolves faster than IgE-mediated allergy.

### Diagnosis
- **IgE-mediated Allergy**: 
  - Suspect if symptoms are multiple, persistent, severe, or treatment-resistant.
  - Typical symptoms: urticaria, angio-oedema, itching, cough, hoarseness, wheeze, breathlessness.
  
- **Non-IgE-mediated Allergy**: 
  - Suspect if there are symptoms like:
    - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
    - Abdominal discomfort
    - Constipation
    - Diarrhoea
    - Atopic eczema (especially treatment-resistant).

### Assessment
1. **Symptom Inquiry**: Timing, reproducibility, comorbid conditions.
2. **Examination**: Nutritional status, comorbid atopic conditions.
3. **Allergy Testing**: Skin prick testing and/or serum-specific IgE if IgE-mediated allergy is suspected.

### Management
- **Immediate Action**: 
  - Ambulance transfer for systemic symptoms or suspected anaphylaxis.
  
- **Referral**:
  - To specialist allergy clinic for suspected IgE-mediated allergy.
  - To specialist allergy clinic for suspected non-IgE-mediated allergy (e.g., faltering growth, severe reactions, significant atopic eczema).
  - To paediatric dietitian for growth monitoring and hypoallergenic formula advice.

- **Dietary Management**:
  - Trial elimination of cow's milk from diet for 2-4 weeks if non-IgE-mediated allergy is suspected.
  - Follow up with home reintroduction to confirm diagnosis.
  - Cow's milk-free diet until 9-12 months old for confirmed non-IgE-mediated allergy, followed by home reintroduction to assess tolerance using a 'milk ladder'.

- **Support**:
  - Advise parents/carers on sources of information and support, including allergen avoidance.
