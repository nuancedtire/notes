## Tuberculosis Overview

- **Cause**: Infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex.
- **Transmission**: Inhalation of bacteria from respiratory droplets of an infected person.

### Disease Types
- **Active TB**: Symptomatic or progressive disease affecting lungs (most common) and/or other organs (extrapulmonary TB).
- **Latent TB**: No clinically active disease; person is asymptomatic and not infectious.

### Risk Factors
- Born in high prevalence areas
- Children and adult males
- Previously untreated infections
- Close contact with active TB
- Immunosuppressive conditions or medications
- Under-served populations

### Symptoms of Active TB
- General: Weight loss, fever, night sweats, anorexia, malaise
- **Pulmonary TB**: Persistent productive cough, breathlessness, hemoptysis
- **Extrapulmonary TB**: Organ-specific symptoms

### Investigations
- **For suspected active pulmonary TB**:
  - Chest X-ray
  - Three sputum samples
- **For suspected active extrapulmonary TB**:
  - Chest X-ray
  - Sputum sample (if possible)
  - Additional site-specific investigations

### Screening Recommendations
- High-risk asymptomatic individuals should be screened by the local multidisciplinary TB team, including:
  - Contacts of active pulmonary/laryngeal TB
  - Immunocompromised individuals
  - New entrants from high TB prevalence countries
  - New NHS employees working with patients or specimens
  - Individuals with TB scarring or untreated fibrotic changes on chest X-ray

### Management
- **For suspected active TB**:
  - Arrange admission or urgent referral for specialist assessment.
  - Avoid delays for culture results if symptoms suggest active TB.
  
- **For known active or latent TB**:
  - Re-referral to local multidisciplinary TB team if treatment not completed.

### Primary Care Management of Confirmed Active TB
- Provide information, advice, and support to patients and caregivers.
- Encourage adherence to specialist treatment.
- Advise on healthy lifestyle measures (stop smoking, limit alcohol).
- Offer psychosocial support if needed.
- Inform about transmission risks to close contacts and arrange contact tracing.
- Educate about symptoms of relapse post-treatment and the importance of immediate reporting.
