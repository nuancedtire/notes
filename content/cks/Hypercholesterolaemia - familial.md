## Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) Summary

- **Definition**: Inherited condition with high cholesterol, leading to early [[atherosclerosis]] and coronary heart disease (CHD).
- **Types**:
  - **Heterozygous FH**: Inherited from one parent (common).
  - **Homozygous FH**: Inherited from both parents (rare).

### Suspicions for FH in Adults
- **Criteria**:
  - Total cholesterol > 7.5 mmol/L, and/or
  - Personal/family history of premature CHD (event before 60 in index person or first-degree relative).

### Primary Care Search
- Identify high-risk individuals:
  - **< 30 years**: Total cholesterol > 7.5 mmol/L.
  - **â‰¥ 30 years**: Total cholesterol > 9.0 mmol/L.

### If FH is Suspected
1. **LDL Cholesterol Measurements**: Take two readings.
2. **Clinical Assessment**: Look for signs like tendon xanthomata.
3. **Exclude Secondary Hypercholesterolaemia**.
4. **Diagnosis Criteria**: Use Simon Broome or Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria.
5. **Referral**: Refer to a specialist for diagnosis confirmation and cascade testing.

### Management Guidelines
- **Risk Assessment**: Do not use CHD risk assessment tools for FH patients.
- **High-Risk Management**: 
  - Adults with confirmed heterozygous FH at high risk (defined by):
    - Established CHD.
    - Family history of premature CHD.
    - Two or more cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., male gender, smoking, hypertension, diabetes).
  
### Primary Care Management for Heterozygous FH
- **Lifestyle Advice**: Provide guidance on healthy living.
- **Lipid-Modification Therapy**: Prescribe high-intensity statin or ezetimibe; target LDL reduction > 50% from baseline.
- **Additional Treatments**: Consider antihypertensive treatment and aspirin for primary CVD prevention.
- **Follow-Up**: Monitor treatment efficacy and tolerability.
- **Specialist Referral**: As necessary.

### Management for Homozygous FH
- All patients should be managed by a specialist.

### Pediatric Management
- All children and young people (up to 15 years) with FH should be managed by a specialist with expertise in pediatric FH.
