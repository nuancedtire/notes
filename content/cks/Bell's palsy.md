## Bell's Palsy Summary

### Overview
- **Definition**: Acute, unilateral facial nerve weakness/paralysis of rapid onset (less than 72 hours) with an unknown cause.
- **Potential Contributors**: Herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, autoimmunity (significance unclear).
- **Incidence**: 20â€“30 cases per 100,000 annually; most common age: 15-45 years.

### Complications
- Eye injury
- Facial pain
- Dry mouth
- Intolerance to loud noises
- Abnormal facial muscle contraction during voluntary movements
- Psychological sequelae

### Diagnosis
- Made when no other medical condition causes facial weakness/paralysis.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Rapid onset (less than 72 hours)
  - Unilateral facial muscle weakness (upper/lower face)
    - Eyebrow drooping, mouth corner drooping, loss of nasolabial fold
  - Ear/postauricular pain on affected side
  - Difficulty chewing, dry mouth, taste changes
  - Incomplete eye closure, dry eye, eye pain, excessive tearing
  - Numbness/tingling of cheek/mouth

### Management
- **Eye Care**: 
  - Lubricating eye drops during the day, ointment at night
  - Tape eye closed at bedtime if unable to close
- **Medications**: 
  - Consider prednisolone if presenting within 72 hours
  - Antivirals not recommended alone; may have slight benefit with corticosteroids (specialist advice recommended).

### Referral Guidelines
- **Urgent Referral**: 
  - Possible upper motor neurone cause
  - Cancer
  - Acute systemic/severe local infection
  - Trauma
- **Specialist Referral**: 
  - Ocular symptoms develop (pain, irritation, itch)
  - Atypical features present
  - No improvement after 3 weeks of treatment
  - Worsening or new neurologic findings
  - Incomplete recovery after 3 months
- **Consider Referral**: 
  - Symptoms of aberrant reinnervation 5 months post-onset
  - Emotional support or counseling for persistent facial paralysis/paresis

### Additional Notes
- Routine referral not necessary for uncomplicated Bell's palsy episodes.
