## Threadworm Summary

- **Definition**: Threadworm (Enterobius vermicularis) is a parasitic worm that infests the human gut.
  
- **Transmission**: 
  - Occurs via the faecal-oral route when threadworm eggs are ingested.
  - Eggs can be transferred from:
    - Scratching the perianal area and hand-to-mouth transfer.
    - Contaminated surfaces (toys, bedding, clothing).

- **Prevalence**: 
  - Most common parasitic worm infestation in the UK.
  - Primarily affects:
    - Children under 18 years.
    - Household contacts of infected children.
    - Individuals living in institutions.

- **Symptoms**: 
  - Intense perianal itching, worse at night.
  - Possible asymptomatic cases; infection may be noticed by:
    - Seeing small white thread-like worms on perianal skin or in stools.
  - In females, may involve the genital area with symptoms of pruritus vulvae.
  - Nocturnal itching can lead to disturbed sleep and irritability.

- **Diagnosis**: 
  - Adhesive tape test may be useful if diagnosis is uncertain:
    - Apply transparent tape to the perianal area in the morning and examine under a microscope for eggs.
  - Stool examination is not generally recommended.
  
- **Differential Diagnosis**: 
  - Other causes of perineal and vulval itch:
    - Dermatitis
    - Candidal infection
    - Pubic lice
    - Haemorrhoids

- **Treatment**: 
  - Recommended if threadworms or eggs are detected.
  - Treat all household members simultaneously (unless contraindicated).

  - **For Adults and Children Over 6 Months**:
    - Mebendazole (anthelmintic) combined with hygiene measures.
    - Mebendazole not licensed for children under 2 years.

  - **For Children Aged 6 Months and Under**:
    - Hygiene measures alone for 6 weeks.

  - **For Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women**:
    - Hygiene measures for 6 weeks.
    - Mebendazole contraindicated in the first trimester and should be avoided throughout pregnancy.

- **Recurrence**:
  - Typically due to re-infection, not treatment failure.
  - If infestation recurs:
    - Consider re-treatment with mebendazole for the infected person and household contacts (unless contraindicated).
    - Reinforce strict hygiene measures.
    - Seek advice from a paediatrician or infectious disease consultant for frequent recurrences.
