## Cerebral Palsy (CP) Summary

### Definition
- CP is a group of permanent movement and posture disorders that limit activity.
- Caused by acquired pathology in the developing brain during prenatal, neonatal, or early infant period.
- Impaired movement results from abnormal muscle tone, leading to spasticity.

### Associated Disorders
- Sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behavior issues.
- Possible effects: musculoskeletal problems, neurogenic bladder, gastro-oesophageal reflux, excessive salivation, feeding and swallowing difficulties.

### Prevalence
- In resource-rich countries: 2.0 to 3.5 per 1,000 live births.
- Causes include prematurity, multiple gestation, and maternal infections (e.g., chorioamnionitis).
- 35% of infants born before 26 weeks gestation develop CP.
- Prevalence in twins: 12.6 per 1,000; in triplets: 44.8 per 1,000.

### Early Motor Features
- Unusual fidgety movements or movement abnormalities (asymmetry, paucity).
- Abnormal tone: hypotonia, spasticity, dystonia.
- Delayed motor development: late head control, rolling, crawling.
- Feeding difficulties.

### Delayed Motor Milestones
- Not sitting by 8 months.
- Not walking by 18 months.
- Asymmetry of hand function before 1 year.

### Clinical Follow-Up
- Enhanced clinical and developmental follow-up for at-risk children up to age 2 (corrected for gestational age).
- Referral to child development services for suspected CP for early diagnosis and intervention.

### Management
- Confirmed CP requires specialist management from a multidisciplinary team, which may include:
  - Pediatric medicine
  - Nursing care
  - Physiotherapy
  - Occupational therapy
  - Speech and language therapy
  - Dietetics
  - Psychology

### Support for Adults with CP
- Access to specialist services may include:
  - Advocacy support
  - Learning disability services
  - Mental health services
  - Orthopaedic surgery and rehabilitation
  - Rehabilitation engineering
  - Specialist neurology services
  - Secondary care for comorbidities
  - Social care and therapy services

### Role of General Practitioners (GPs)
- Coordinate care and identify/manage associated problems early.
- Support patients and families.
- Manage common medical issues: nutritional problems, pain, mental health, constipation, gastro-oesophageal reflux, respiratory problems.
- Prescribe medications, provide information on physical activity and support services.
- Assist in transitions from child to adult care or from hospital to home.
- Help with advance care planning.
