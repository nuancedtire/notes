## Bruising: Summary

- **Definition**: A bruise is a haematoma that forms due to bleeding under intact skin into subcutaneous tissue, caused by vascular damage or injury.

- **Causes**:
  - Commonly results from accidental trauma.
  - Can be non-accidental (especially in children subjected to physical abuse).
  - Excessive bruising or bruising from minimal trauma may point to:
    - **Vascular disorders** (e.g., senile or simple purpura).
    - **Platelet disorders** (e.g., idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, leukaemia, liver disease).
    - **Coagulation disorders** (e.g., haemophilia, vitamin K deficiency, von Willebrand disease).
    - **Drugs** (e.g., corticosteroids, warfarin, alcohol).

- **Key Consideration**: The presence of a bleeding disorder does not exclude the possibility of non-accidental injury.

- **Assessment**:
  - Inquire about symptoms indicative of a platelet or coagulation disorder (e.g., nosebleeds, menorrhagia).
  - Explore possible underlying medical conditions.
  - Ask about alcohol and drug use.
  - Check family history of bleeding disorders or tendency to bruise easily.
  - Assess the location and pattern of bruising relative to age, mobility, developmental status, and injury explanation.

- **Investigation**:
  - **Adults with unexplained bruising**:
    - Urgent full blood count (within 48 hours) for leukaemia assessment.
    - Blood film.
    - Clotting screen.
    - Liver, renal, and thyroid function tests based on clinical judgement.
  
  - **Children/Young people with unexplained bruising**:
    - Same urgent full blood count and blood film.
    - Blood results may be normal in mild coagulation and platelet disorders.
  
- **Referral Guidelines**:
  - **Children/Young people**:
    - Immediate referral to appropriate agency if non-accidental injury is suspected.
    - Urgent specialist assessment for leukaemia if there is:
      - Unexplained petechiae.
      - Hepatosplenomegaly.
      - Full blood count results suggestive of leukaemia.
    - Urgent assessment for neuroblastoma (within 48 hours) if:
      - Palpable abdominal mass.
      - Unexplained enlarged abdominal organ.
    - Discuss further investigations with paediatrician or paediatric haematologist for other cases.

  - **Adults**:
    - Immediate specialist assessment if full blood count suggests leukaemia.
    - Referral to a haematologist if:
      - Low platelet count.
      - Abnormal clotting screen.
      - Normal primary care blood results but bleeding disorder is suspected (urgency based on clinical judgement).
