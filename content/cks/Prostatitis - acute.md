### Prostatitis - Acute: Summary

**Definition:**
- Acute bacterial prostatitis: Severe, potentially life-threatening bacterial infection of the prostate.

**Causes:**
- Urinary infection pathogens may arise from:
  - Urethral instrumentation
  - Trauma
  - Bladder outflow obstruction
  - Dissemination of infection from outside the urinary tract

**Recovery:**
- Most men recover completely within 2 weeks with appropriate treatment.

**Signs and Symptoms:**
- **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI):**
  - Dysuria, frequency, urgency
- **Prostatitis Symptoms:**
  - Perineal, penile, or rectal pain
  - Acute urinary retention
  - Obstructive voiding symptoms
  - Low back pain
  - Pain on ejaculation
  - Tender, swollen, warm prostate (on gentle rectal examination)
- **Bacteraemia Symptoms:**
  - Rigors, arthralgia, myalgia
  - Fever, tachycardia

**Assessment:**
1. Collect mid-stream urine (MSU) sample to confirm UTI via:
   - Dipstick
   - Culture and sensitivity
2. Arrange blood cultures and full blood count.
3. Conduct physical examination:
   - Abdomen (distended bladder, costovertebral angle tenderness)
   - Genital examination
   - Digital rectal examination (DRE)
4. Consider screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in at-risk men.
5. Consider and exclude other diagnoses.

**Treatment:**
- **First-line antibiotics (14 days):**
  - Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily
  - Ofloxacin 200 mg twice daily
  - Trimethoprim 200 mg twice daily (if unsuitable for first-line)
- **Second-line options:**
  - Levofloxacin 500 mg once daily
  - Co-trimoxazole 960 mg twice daily

**Patient Advice:**
- Take paracetamol (with/without low-dose opioid like codeine) for pain, or ibuprofen if preferred.
- Drink enough fluids to avoid dehydration.
- Be informed about the usual course of acute prostatitis (several weeks) and possible antibiotic side effects.
- Seek medical help if:
  - Symptoms worsen
  - No improvement within 48 hours of antibiotics
  - Become systemically very unwell.

**Follow-Up:**
- Arrange follow-up after 48 hours to check treatment response and urine culture results.
- Review and change antibiotic choice based on susceptibility results if resistant.
- Arrange hospital admission if no improvement after 48 hours of treatment.

**Referrals:**
- Urgent referral to GUM clinic if STI identified.
- Referral for investigation to exclude urinary tract structural abnormalities after recovery.

**Hospital Admission Criteria:**
- Unable to take oral antibiotics
- Severe symptoms
- Signs/symptoms of serious conditions (e.g., sepsis, acute urinary retention, prostatic abscess)

**Urgent Referral Considerations:**
- Immunocompromised or has diabetes mellitus
- Pre-existing urological conditions (e.g., benign prostatic hypertrophy, indwelling catheter) requiring specialist management.
