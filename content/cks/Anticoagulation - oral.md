## Anticoagulation - Oral Summary

### Types of Oral Anticoagulants
1. **Vitamin K Antagonists (VKAs)**
   - **Warfarin**
     - Coumarin derivative.
     - Inhibits vitamin K dependent clotting factors: II, VII, IX, X.
     - Also inhibits anticoagulant proteins C and S.
     - Uses:
       - Prophylaxis of embolization in:
         - Rheumatic heart disease
         - [[msra/Cardiovascular/Atrial Fibrillation|Atrial fibrillation]]
         - After prosthetic heart valve insertion
       - Prophylaxis and treatment of:
         - Venous thrombosis
         - Pulmonary embolism (PE)
         - Transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs)

2. **Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs)**
   - **Apixaban, Dabigatran, Edoxaban, Rivaroxaban**
     - Novel mechanisms of action:
       - Apixaban, Edoxaban, Rivaroxaban: Direct and reversible inhibitors of factor Xa.
         - Prevent thrombin generation and thrombus development.
       - Dabigatran: Reversible inhibitor of free and fibrin-bound thrombin; inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.
     - Uses:
       - Stroke and systemic embolism prevention in adults with non-valvular [[msra/Cardiovascular/Atrial Fibrillation|atrial fibrillation]] and ≥1 risk factor (e.g., heart failure, hypertension, previous stroke/TIA, age ≥75, diabetes).
       - PE and DVT treatment and recurrent DVT/PE prevention.
       - Prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism post-elective hip or knee replacement (Apixaban, Dabigatran, Rivaroxaban).
       - Rivaroxaban: Prophylaxis of atherothrombotic events post-[[acute coronary syndrome]] (with aspirin) and for high-risk patients with coronary artery disease or symptomatic peripheral artery disease (with aspirin).

### Adverse Effects
- **Common Adverse Effect**: Bleeding.
- **Antidotes**:
  - Available for Warfarin, Apixaban, Dabigatran, and Rivaroxaban.
  - No antidote for Edoxaban.

### Monitoring
- **Warfarin**: Requires regular INR monitoring.
- **DOACs**: Do not require regular INR monitoring but need regular follow-up to:
  - Review treatment
  - Assess for adverse effects (e.g., bleeding)
  - Monitor for thromboembolic events
  - Provide information and advice.
