### Onset
- Diagnosed typically in children over 3 years old.
- **Early Onset:** Symptoms begin before 10 years of age.

### Assessment
- Thorough assessment is necessary if a conduct disorder is suspected.
- Considerations include:
  - Symptoms across various settings
  - Impact on individual and others
  - Family situation and background
  - Medical history and mental health

### Referral to Specialists
Children with significant complicating factors should be referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) if they have:
- Coexisting mental health issues (e.g., depression, PTSD)
- Neurodevelopmental conditions (e.g., ADHD, autism)
- Learning disabilities or difficulties
- Substance misuse

### Interventions
Children without complicating factors should be referred for interventions such as:
- Parent training
- Child-focused programmes
- Multimodal interventions (age and availability dependent)

### Communication with Agencies
- It is good practice to inform other agencies involved in the child's care about referrals made to CAMHS or for direct interventions.
