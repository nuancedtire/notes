## Olecranon Bursitis Summary

- **Olecranon Bursa**: A sac over the olecranon process of the elbow; reduces friction between skin, tendons, ligaments, and bone.

- **Bursitis Types**:
  - **Non-septic** (most common): Sterile inflammation due to trauma or overuse.
  - **Septic**: Infection from microorganisms (usually bacteria).

- **Commonly Affected Individuals**:
  - Young or middle-aged men.
  - Individuals in jobs with regular elbow trauma (e.g., gardeners, mechanics).
  - Athletes in sports involving repetitive elbow movements.

- **Symptoms**:
  - Swelling over the elbow appearing over hours to days; may be tender, warm, or painless, and is fluctuant.
  - Painless movement at the elbow joint except at full flexion.
  - History of preceding trauma or bursal disease.
  - Local skin abrasion may be present.

- **Management**:
  - **Conservative Measures**: Rest, compression bandaging, avoid elbow trauma, analgesia.
  
  - **Non-septic Bursitis**:
    - Reassurance that most respond to conservative treatment.
    - Consider aspiration for large effusions.
    - Consider corticosteroid injection.
    - Referral if no improvement after 2 months.

  - **Septic Bursitis**:
    - Aspiration and empirical antibiotic treatment until culture results.
    - Urgent referral if no response or complications suspected.
    - Consider repeated aspiration for recurring symptoms.
    - Manage associated conditions (e.g., gout, rheumatoid arthritis).

- **Hospital Admission Criteria**:
  - Suspected septic joint (limited range of motion).
  - Septic bursitis with severe infection or systemic toxicity.
  - Same-day admission for:
    - Pointing abscess needing drainage (if expertise unavailable).
    - Extensive cellulitis.
  
- **Referral Guidelines**:
  - Urgent referral for recurrent septic bursitis.
  - Consider referral for non-septic bursitis not responding to conservative measures after 2 months (earlier if symptoms are pronounced).
