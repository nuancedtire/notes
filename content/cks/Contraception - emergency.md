## Emergency Contraception (EC) Summary

- **Definition**: EC is used to prevent unintended pregnancy after unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI) or contraceptive failure.

- **When to Consider EC**:
  - Any day of the natural menstrual cycle.
  - After hormonal contraception is compromised or used incorrectly.
  - From day 21 postpartum (if LAM criteria are not met).
  - From day 5 post-miscarriage, abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or uterine evacuation for gestational trophoblastic disease.

- **Methods of EC Available in the UK**:
  1. **Copper Intrauterine Device (Cu-IUD)**:
     - Inhibits fertilization (toxic effect on sperm and ova).
     - Has an anti-implantation effect if fertilization occurs.
  2. **Ulipristal Acetate (30 mg)**:
     - Delays ovulation for at least 5 days, even after the LH surge.
  3. **Levonorgestrel (1.5 mg)**:
     - Inhibits ovulation if taken before the LH surge; ineffective in the late follicular phase.

- **Administration Timing**:
  - **Oral EC**: Should be taken as soon as possible after UPSI for maximum efficacy; ineffective if taken after ovulation.

- **Process When a Woman Requests EC**:
  - Take a full history to confirm EC indication and exclude pregnancy.
  - Discuss EC options considering:
    - UK Medical Eligibility Criteria
    - Woman's preference
    - Current medications
    - Postpartum or breastfeeding status
    - Body mass index/weight
    - Timing of UPSI
  - Provide information on different EC methods for informed choice.
  - Assess risk for sexual abuse or STIs.
  - Offer regular contraception if not currently using any.

- **Best Practices**:
  - Cu-IUD is the most effective method and should be offered if suitable and acceptable.
  - Cu-IUD can be inserted within 5 days after first UPSI or estimated ovulation.
  - If Cu-IUD is unsuitable, consider:
    - **Ulipristal Acetate**: Licensed for use within 5 days (120 hours) after UPSI or failure.
    - **Levonorgestrel**: Licensed for use within 72 hours after UPSI or failure.
