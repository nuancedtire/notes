## Breathlessness: Summary

**Definition**  
- Breathlessness: Subjective, distressing sensation of difficulty with breathing.

**Classification by Speed of Onset**  
1. **Acute**: Develops over minutes.  
2. **Subacute**: Develops over hours or days.  
3. **Chronic**: Develops over weeks or months.  

**Common Cardiac Causes**  
- Silent myocardial infarction  
- Cardiac arrhythmia  
- Acute pulmonary oedema  
- Chronic heart failure  

**Common Pulmonary Causes**  
- Asthma  
- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  
- Pneumonia  
- Pulmonary embolism  
- Lung cancer  
- Pleural effusion  

**Other Common Causes**  
- Anaemia  
- Diaphragmatic splinting (due to ascites, obesity, or pregnancy)  
- Psychogenic breathlessness  

**Initial Assessment**  
- Conduct Airway, Breathing, Circulation (ABC) assessment.  
- Assess:  
  - Blood pressure  
  - Pulse rate  
  - Respiratory rate  
  - Temperature  
  - Level of consciousness  
  - Oxygen saturation  

**Emergency Admission Criteria**  
- Rapid onset or worsening of suspected heart failure symptoms  
- Anaphylaxis  
- Suspected sepsis  
- ECG indicating cardiac arrhythmia or myocardial infarction  
- Clinical signs of pulmonary embolus, pneumothorax, pulmonary oedema, superior vena cava obstruction, or [[cardiac tamponade]]  
- Severe or life-threatening asthma attack or COPD exacerbation  

**Management in Emergency Situations**  
- If oxygen saturation is 94% or less, administer oxygen and continuously monitor levels while awaiting transfer (if not at risk of hypercapnia).

**If Emergency Admission Not Indicated**  
- Manage the underlying cause of breathlessness.  
- Arrange investigations to identify or confirm the cause.
