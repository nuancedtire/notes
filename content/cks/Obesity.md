- **Definitions:**
  - **Overweight & Obesity:** Excess body fat.
  - **Causes:** Imbalance of energy intake vs. expenditure; influenced by lifestyle, genetics, medical conditions, and medications.

- **Health Risks Associated with Obesity:**
  - Chronic diseases: 
    - Type 2 diabetes
    - Coronary heart disease
    - Hypertension
    - Stroke
    - Depression
    - Certain cancers
    - Obstructive sleep apnoea
    - Breathlessness
    - Psychological distress
  - **Consequences:** Decreased life expectancy, increased health service demands, economic impacts (hospital admissions, time off work).

- **Weight Loss Benefits:** Most complications can be reduced through weight loss.

- **Body Mass Index (BMI):**
  - **Definition:** Practical measure for overweight and obesity; calculated as weight (kg) / height (m²).
  - **Categories:**
    - Healthy weight: BMI 18.5–24.9 kg/m²
    - Overweight: BMI 25–29.9 kg/m²
    - Obesity 1: BMI 30–34.9 kg/m²
    - Obesity 2: BMI 35–39.9 kg/m²
    - Obesity 3: BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²
  - **Caution:** Not a direct measure of central adiposity; clinical judgment needed for interpretation, especially in specific ethnic groups prone to central adiposity (e.g., South Asian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, Black African, African-Caribbean).

- **Waist-to-Height Ratio:**
  - **Use:** In people with BMI < 35 kg/m² to assess central adiposity.
  - **Categories:**
    - Healthy: 0.4 to 0.49 (no increased health risks)
    - Increased: 0.5 to 0.59 (increased health risks)
    - High: ≥ 0.6 (further increased health risks)

- **Clinical Communication:**
  - Sensitively discuss weight status and health risks.
  - Use clinical judgment for comorbidity assessment based on individual circumstances.

- **Treatment Approaches:**
  - **Multicomponent Interventions:** Preferred for overweight/obese individuals.
    - Tailor to preferences, fitness, health status, lifestyle.
    - Include behavior change strategies for:
      - Increasing physical activity
      - Improving eating behavior
      - Reducing energy intake
  - **Drug Treatment:** Consider for adults with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with risk factors (e.g., type 2 diabetes, hypertension).
  - **Bariatric Surgery:** Recommended for:
    - Adults with BMI > 50 kg/m² when other interventions fail.
    - Adults with BMI ≥ 40 kg/m² or 35–40 kg/m² with significant comorbidities (e.g., type 2 diabetes, hypertension).
