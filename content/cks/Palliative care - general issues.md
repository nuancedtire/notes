- **Definition**: Palliative care is the active holistic care for individuals with advanced, progressive illnesses.

- **General Principles**:
  - Involvement should occur as early as possible after diagnosis.
  - Aim to meet the needs of patients, families, and carers within the team's knowledge and competence.
  - Seek specialist advice or refer to specialist services when necessary.

- **Assessment and Management**:
  - Assess patient and family needs at key points:
    - Time of diagnosis
    - Around treatment episodes
    - As treatments end
    - At the time of relapse
    - When death is approaching
  - Key areas of assessment:
    - Preferred care setting
    - Anticipatory prescribing
    - Management of common physical symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, breathlessness)
    - Psychological needs
    - Social needs (e.g., personal care, housework, shopping)
    - Family and carer needs

- **Prognosis**:
  - Estimate patient prognosis to adjust care in the terminal phase, which can last from hours to several days.
  - Indicators of being in the terminal phase include:
    - Deterioration in condition
    - Patient's awareness of dying

- **Communication**:
  - Effective verbal and written communication with patients, carers, and healthcare professionals is crucial.
  - Develop an individualized care plan.
  - Allow discussions on important topics (e.g., advance care planning, prognosis).
  - Provide emergency contact numbers and guidance for family and carers upon death.

- **Care for Advanced Cancer**:
  - Should follow locally agreed protocols and guidelines within a managed system.
  - Requires a multidisciplinary team due to the multidimensional nature of palliative care challenges.
