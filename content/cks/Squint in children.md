## Squint in Children: Quick Revision

### Definition
- **Squint (Strabismus)**: Misalignment of the visual axis; eyes not directed at the same object.
  - Types:
    - **Esotropia**: Eye turns in
    - **Exotropia**: Eye turns out
    - **Hypertropia**: Eye turns up
    - **Hypotropia**: Eye turns down
- **Pseudo Squint**: Appearance of misalignment without actual squint (e.g., prominent epicanthic folds).

### Prevalence
- Affects about **2-3%** of children.

### Causes
- **Lack of Coordination**: Prevents both eyes from focusing on the same point.
- **Idiopathic**: Most cases have no clearly defined cause.
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Low birth weight
  - Prematurity
  - Maternal smoking during pregnancy
  - Hypermetropia
  - Family history of squint
  - Assisted or Caesarean delivery

### Known Causes
- **Refractive Errors**: Especially hypermetropia.
- **Poor Visual Acuity**: Conditions like:
  - Ocular malformations
  - Optic neuropathy
  - Amblyopia (lazy eye)
  - Congenital cataract
  - Retinoblastoma
- **Neurodevelopmental Conditions**.
- **Diseases** affecting extra-ocular muscles or innervation (e.g., cranial nerve palsies).

### Complications of Untreated Squint
- Amblyopia
- Loss of binocular vision
- Poor stereopsis (depth perception)
- Abnormal head postures
- Social and psychological issues
- Most squints can become permanent if untreated.

### Treatment
- **Goals**: Prevent/limit amblyopia and correct eye misalignment; possible restoration of binocular vision.
- **Detection**: Routine childhood screening; parents often notice a "turning eye."
- **Primary Care Assessment**:
  - Detailed history
  - Eye examinations (general inspection, corneal light reflex test, cover tests)
  - General clinical assessment for underlying disorders.
  
### Referral
- Children with suspected or confirmed squint should be referred to pediatric eye services, especially if a serious cause is suspected.

### Secondary Care Treatments
- **Glasses**: To correct refractive errors.
- **Occlusion/Penalization Therapy**: For amblyopia treatment.
- **Surgery/Botulinum Toxin Injection**: To correct eye misalignment.
