## Pruritus Ani Summary

- **Definition**: Pruritus ani is characterized by perianal itching or burning. It is a symptom, not a diagnosis.

- **Types**:
  - **Primary (Idiopathic)**: Functional in nature.
    - **Functional Pruritus Ani**: Caused by a small amount of fecal loss due to anorectal dysfunction, leading to irritation from fecal matter. Accounts for ~90% of cases.
  - **Secondary**: Has specific underlying causes, including:
    - Skin conditions (e.g., dermatitis, psoriasis)
    - Infections/infestations (e.g., staphylococcal infections, scabies)
    - Colorectal/anal pathologies (e.g., anal fissure, hemorrhoids, colorectal cancer)
    - Systemic diseases (e.g., diabetes mellitus, anemia)
    - Psychological conditions (e.g., depression)
    - Medications (e.g., corticosteroids, colchicine)
    - Food/drinks (e.g., spicy foods, nuts, beer, wine)

- **Chronic Nature**: If no specific cause is diagnosed, pruritus ani may become chronic. Most people respond well to management.

- **Consequences of Persistent Scratching**:
  - Skin damage (eczema, lichenification, ulceration, excoriation)
  - Secondary bacterial infections
  - Psychological issues (embarrassment, stigma, depression, anxiety)
  - Insomnia

- **Assessment**:
  - Careful patient history
  - Examination of the perianal area
  - Digital rectal examination in adults if needed
  - If no cause is found, likely primary pruritus ani.

- **Management**:
  - Address any underlying causes.
  - Lifestyle advice:
    - Avoid scratching
    - Keep nails short
    - Maintain good anal hygiene
    - Avoid known irritants (foods/drinks)
  - Ensure regular and formed stools to minimize leakage.
  - Symptomatic treatments:
    - Soothing topical preparations (bismuth subgallate, zinc oxide)
    - Mildly potent topical corticosteroids for inflammation
    - Sedating antihistamines for nocturnal itching

- **Referral to Specialist**:
  - Suspected serious underlying cause (e.g., anorectal cancer)
  - Treatment needed not available in primary care
  - Persistent symptoms after self-care and symptomatic treatment.
