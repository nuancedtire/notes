## Pityriasis Rosea: Quick Revision Guide

### Overview
- **Definition**: Self-limiting skin rash with scaly, erythematous lesions.
- **Herald Patch**: Appears 5–15 days before the generalized rash (not always present).
- **Age Group**: Primarily affects older children and young adults (ages 10-35).
- **Gender**: More common in women than men.
- **Prognosis**: Resolves completely without long-term complications.

### Pregnancy Considerations
- Associated with adverse outcomes in the first 15 weeks, including miscarriage and premature delivery.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Based on appearance and distribution of lesions.
- **Herald Patch**: 
  - Size: 2–5 cm in diameter.
  - Location: Commonly on trunk, thigh, upper arm, or neck.
- **Lesion Characteristics**:
  - Color: Pink-red (salmon) or fawn.
  - Shape: Flat or slightly raised, circular or oval (0.5–1 cm in diameter).
  - Scaling: Typically confined to the edge with central clearance.
- **Distribution**: 
  - Symmetrical; most lesions on trunk (forming 'Christmas tree' pattern) and proximal limbs.

### Management
- **Urgent Discussion**: Required if developed during pregnancy.
- **General Treatment**: Usually not required; rash may worsen before resolving.
- **Timeline**: Rash typically resolves in 2–3 months, up to 5 months possible.
- **Post-Rash Effects**: Possible hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation; no scarring.

### Symptomatic Relief
- **For Itch**: 
  - Use emollient or mild/moderately-potent topical corticosteroid.
  - Consider sedating oral antihistamine at night if itching disrupts sleep (off-label use).
