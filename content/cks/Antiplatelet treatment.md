- **Antiplatelet Treatment Overview**
  - Decreases platelet aggregation and inhibits thrombus formation in arterial circulation.

- **Types of Antiplatelet Drugs:**
  - **Aspirin**
    - Irreversibly inhibits cyclo-oxygenase.
    - Blocks thromboxane production.
  - **Clopidogrel, Prasugrel, Ticagrelor**
    - Block platelet P2Y12 receptor.
    - Inhibit binding of adenosine diphosphate/triphosphate, blocking activation and aggregation.
  - **Dipyridamole**
    - Antiplatelet and vasodilatory properties.
    - Phosphodiesterase III inhibitor; increases cAMP, inhibiting aggregation.
  - **Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa Inhibitors** (e.g., abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban)
    - Block fibrinogen binding to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors.
    - Administered intravenously in secondary care.

- **Indications for Antiplatelet Treatment:**
  - **Secondary Prevention:**
    - Atherothrombotic events in:
      - [[Acute coronary syndrome]] (ACS)
      - [[msra/Cardiovascular/Angina|Angina]]
      - Peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
      - [[msra/Cardiovascular/Atrial Fibrillation|Atrial fibrillation]] (AF) (anticoagulants usually preferred)
    - After myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stroke, or transient ischaemic attack (TIA).
  - **Primary Prevention:**
    - Not routinely prescribed; consider for very high-risk individuals on a case-by-case basis.

- **Long-term Antiplatelet Monotherapy for Secondary Prevention:**
  - **Stable Coronary Heart Disease:** Aspirin 75 mg (first choice).
  - **Stable Cerebrovascular Disease:** Clopidogrel 75 mg daily (preferred).
  - **Symptomatic Peripheral Arterial Disease:** Clopidogrel 75 mg (preferred).
  - **Recent Evidence:** Low-dose rivaroxaban with aspirin may benefit stable cardiovascular and PAD patients.

- **Dual Antiplatelet Treatment (DAPT):**
  - **[[Acute Coronary Syndrome]]:**
    - DAPT with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel) preferred.
    - Second antiplatelet continued for up to 12 months.
    - Prasugrel and ticagrelor: more effective, faster onset, higher bleeding risk.
  - **Following Elective PCI:**
    - DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel for 6 months for stable coronary artery disease.
  - **Acute Cerebrovascular Disease:**
    - DAPT may be used for 3-4 weeks after TIAs or minor ischaemic strokes.

- **Reducing Dyspepsia Risk with Antiplatelet Agents:**
  - Use low-dose aspirin (75 mg).
  - Test and treat for Helicobacter pylori if history of ulcer disease or upper GI bleeding.
  - Consider proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for high-risk individuals (avoid omeprazole and esomeprazole with clopidogrel).
  - Refer for investigation if GI symptoms persist despite treatment.

- **Patient Advisory:**
  - Inform dental or surgical teams before any procedures while on antiplatelet medication.
