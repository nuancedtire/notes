## Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Summary

### Definition
- PTSD can develop after a major traumatic event and affects individuals of all ages.
  
### Major Traumatic Event
- **ICD-11**: Describes it as a stressful event likely to cause pervasive distress.
- **DSM-5**: Defines it as exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence.

### Onset of Symptoms
- Symptoms typically arise within the first month after the event.
- Some individuals may experience delayed symptoms (months or years later).

### Adult Symptom Course
- **Resolution**: Approximately two-thirds experience natural resolution (may take several months).
- **Persistence**: One-third may have longer-lasting, severe symptoms.

### Complex PTSD
- May arise from extreme prolonged or repeated trauma (e.g., childhood sexual abuse, prolonged captivity involving torture).

### Symptoms to Suspect PTSD
1. **Re-experiencing**: Flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, or nightmares.
2. **Avoidance**: Steering clear of reminders (people, places).
3. **Emotional numbing/negative thoughts**: Feelings of detachment, inability to experience emotions, negative self-perception.
4. **Hyperarousal/hyperreactivity**: Constant vigilance, irritability, angry outbursts.

### Management Recommendations
- **Sub-clinical PTSD**: Consider watchful waiting and regular reviews.
- **Clinically important PTSD**:
  - Refer to specialist mental health services for trauma-based therapies or drug treatment.
  - Assess for emergency medical or psychiatric needs based on secondary psychological disorders.

### Recommendations for Children and Young People (under 18)
- If symptoms persist beyond one month, refer to specialist mental health services.
- If trauma occurred within the last month, use clinical judgment for watchful waiting vs. referral.
