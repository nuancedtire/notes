## Jaundice in the Newborn: Summary

- **Definition**: Jaundice is characterized by yellow coloration of skin and sclerae due to bilirubin accumulation (hyperbilirubinaemia).

- **Causes of Bilirubin Accumulation**:
  - Breakdown of red blood cells.
  - Higher red blood cell concentration and shorter lifespan in neonates.

- **Types of Jaundice**:
  - **Physiological Jaundice**: 
    - Common and generally harmless.
    - Can occur in breastfed and formula-fed infants.
    - Breastmilk jaundice: Prolongation of physiological jaundice in breastfed infants.
  - **Pathological Neonatal Jaundice**: 
    - Caused by factors such as:
      - Blood group incompatibility
      - Sepsis
      - Bruising
      - Metabolic disorders (e.g., Gilbert's syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome)
      - Glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase deficiency
      - Congenital biliary system issues (e.g., biliary atresia)

- **Complications**:
  - Neurological complications are rare.
  - **Acute Bilirubin Encephalopathy**: Severe hyperbilirubinaemia leading to:
    - Lethargy
    - Irritability
    - Poor suck
    - Abnormal muscle tone/posture (opisthotonus)
    - High-pitched cry
    - Apnoea, seizures, coma
  - **Chronic Bilirubin Encephalopathy**: Resulting features include:
    - Athetoid cerebral palsy
    - Seizures
    - Developmental delay
    - Learning difficulties
    - Vision/hearing problems
    - Dental dysplasia

- **Prognosis**:
  - Physiological jaundice generally resolves by 2 weeks of age.
  - Prognosis for jaundice from underlying conditions depends on the specific cause.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Examine the baby in bright, preferably natural light.
  - Referral to a neonatologist/paediatrician if diagnosis is uncertain.
  - Assess extent of jaundice and underlying causes; visual assessment not reliable for severity.

- **Emergency Protocol**:
  - Neonates with bilirubin encephalopathy require emergency hospital admission.
  - Jaundice appearing < 24 hours of age necessitates urgent admission within 2 hours.
  - Jaundice appearing after 24 hours should have bilirubin level measured within 6 hours.

- **Management**:
  - Varies based on suspected cause; may include:
    - Observation
    - Treatment of underlying illness
    - Phototherapy
    - Exchange transfusion
    - Surgical treatment
