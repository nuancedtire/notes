## Meibomian Cyst (Chalazion) Summary

### Definition
- A meibomian cyst (chalazion) is a chronic, non-infectious inflammatory granuloma due to blockage of meibomian gland duct(s).

### Prevalence
- Most common inflammatory lesions of the eyelids.
- More common in adults (ages 30–50).

### Risk Factors
- Acute stye
- Chronic blepharitis
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis
- Rosacea
- Diabetes mellitus
- Elevated serum cholesterol
- Pregnancy

### Presentation
- Firm, painless lump in upper (more common) or lower eyelid, developing slowly over weeks.
- Size: 2–8 mm in diameter, commonly located away from lid margin.
- Possible occurrence of multiple lesions in one lid.
- Normal overlying skin, but may be indurated.
- Possible ptosis; lid eversion may reveal external conjunctival granuloma.
- Erythema usually absent.

### Diagnosis
- Clinical diagnosis based on history and examination.
- Differential diagnoses: styes, sebaceous cysts, eyelid cancer.

### Signs of Serious Conditions
- Firm, warm, tender, erythematous, oedematous eyelid with severe pain, blurred/double vision, limited and painful eye movements, headache, fever, malaise — suggestive of orbital cellulitis.
- Atypical features (distorted eyelid margin, loss of eyelashes, ulceration, or bleeding) — suggestive of eyelid cancer.
- Chronic/recurrent lesions, especially in older patients — suggestive of possible sebaceous gland carcinoma.

### Management
- Most meibomian cysts resolve spontaneously or with conservative treatment (warm compress, lid massage) over weeks or months.
- Manage underlying risk factors to reduce recurrence risk.
- Avoid routine prescription of antibiotics.

### Referral Considerations
- **Emergency referral** if:
  - Suspected periorbital/orbital cellulitis.
  - Suspected cancer (appropriate pathway referral needed).
  - Large lesions causing corneal distortion, eyelid function interference, or cosmetic concerns.
  - Persistent or recurrent lesions — consider biopsy to exclude eyelid cancer.
