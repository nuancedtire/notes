- **Definition**: Food allergy is an adverse immune-mediated response upon exposure to specific food allergens.

- **IgE-Mediated Food Allergy**: 
  - Produces immediate and reproducible multi-organ symptoms.
  - Common allergens: cows' milk, eggs, peanuts, other legumes, tree nuts, shellfish, fish, wheat.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Pre-existing food allergy.
  - Atopic eczema.
  - Family history of food allergy and/or atopy.

- **Possible Complications**:
  - Severe reactions, including anaphylaxis.
  - Anxiety from constant vigilance over food choices and risk of exposure.
  - Reduced quality of life (dietary restrictions, social interactions, stigma, peer pressure).
  - Restricted diet leading to malnutrition.

- **Diagnosis Indicators**:
  - Symptoms (urticaria, angioedema, itching, cough, hoarseness, wheeze, breathlessness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) occurring within seconds to 1â€“2 hours after eating the trigger food.
  - Unexplained persistent symptoms of atopic eczema.

- **Assessment Steps**:
  - Inquire about causal foods, symptoms, timing, uneventful exposures, reproducibility of symptoms, co-factors, comorbid atopic conditions, and dietary response.
  - Examine nutritional status and signs of clinical reactions.
  - Conduct skin prick testing and/or serum-specific IgE allergy testing.

- **Referral Guidelines**:
  - **Accident and Emergency**: For systemic symptoms or suspected anaphylaxis.
  - **Allergy Specialist**: History of systemic symptoms, increased risk of anaphylaxis, need for allergy testing, uncertain diagnosis, multiple suspected allergies, significant atopic eczema, persistent food allergy, or parental suspicion without supporting history.
  - **Dietitian**: Nutritional concerns, allergen avoidance/reintroduction advice, or current restricted diet.

- **Primary Care Management**:
  - Provide an individualized written allergy management plan.
  - Offer information and support resources.
  - Advise on recognizing and managing acute symptoms (oral antihistamines for non-severe symptoms, adrenaline auto-injectors for anaphylaxis).
  - Educate on allergen avoidance, food label interpretation, cross-contamination, and safe travel.
  - Discuss impact on vaccinations (especially with egg allergy).
  - Ensure optimal management of comorbid conditions (e.g., asthma).
  - Conduct annual reviews.
