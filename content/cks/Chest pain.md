## Chest Pain Summary

### Definition
- Chest pain refers to pain in the thorax.
- It can be classified by cause: **cardiac** or **non-cardiac**.

### Cardiac Causes
- **[[Acute coronary syndrome]] (ACS)**: unstable angina, myocardial infarction
- **Stable [[angina]]**
- Other cardiac conditions: 
  - Dissecting thoracic aneurysm
  - Pericarditis
  - [[Cardiac tamponade]]
  - Myocarditis
  - Acute congestive cardiac failure
  - Arrhythmias

### Respiratory Causes
- Pulmonary embolus
- Pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax
- Community-acquired pneumonia
- Asthma
- Pleural effusion

### Other Causes
- **Gastroenterological**: 
  - Acute pancreatitis
  - Oesophageal rupture
  - Peptic ulcer disease
  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux
  - Oesophageal spasm
  - Oesophagitis
- **Musculoskeletal**: 
  - Rib fracture
  - Costochondritis
  - Spinal disorders (disc prolapse, cervical spondylosis, facet joint dysfunction)
  - Rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis
  - Fibromyalgia
  - Osteoporotic fracture
- **Miscellaneous**: 
  - Cancer (e.g., lung cancer)
  - Herpes zoster
  - Bornholm disease
  - Precordial catch (Texidor twinge)
  - Psychogenic or non-specific chest pain
- **Non-specific chest pain**: no cause identified in ~16% of primary care presentations.

### Diagnosis and Management
- Conduct medical history and examination.
- Further investigations based on suspected cause.

### Hospital Admission Criteria
- Serious cause indicators:
  - Respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min
  - Tachycardia > 130 beats/min
  - Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or diastolic BP < 60 mmHg
  - Oxygen saturation < 92% or central cyanosis
  - Altered level of consciousness
  - Raised temperature (> 38.5Â°C)
  
- **ACS suspected** if:
  - Current chest pain
  - Signs of complications (e.g., pulmonary oedema)
  - Pain-free but had chest pain in the last 12 hours with abnormal ECG or unavailable ECG

### Further Referrals
- **Urgent same-day assessment**:
  - Suspected ACS, pain-free with chest pain in last 12 hours and normal ECG, no complications
  - Chest pain in last 12-72 hours with no complications
  
- **Within 2 weeks**:
  - Suspected ACS, pain-free with chest pain > 72 hours ago, no complications
  - Suspected malignancy
  - Lung/lobar collapse or pleural effusion for investigation and treatment (if admission not required)

- **Routine referrals**:
  - Suspected stable [[angina]]
  - Chest pain of unknown cause
  - Clear diagnosis but persistent symptoms despite management in primary care.
