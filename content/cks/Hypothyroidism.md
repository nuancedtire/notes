## Hypothyroidism Summary

### Definition
- **Hypothyroidism**: Thyroid hormone (T4 and T3) deficiency.

### Types
1. **Overt Hypothyroidism**:
   - TSH: >10 mU/L
   - FT4: <normal range

2. **Subclinical Hypothyroidism**:
   - TSH: >normal range
   - T3 and T4: within normal range

3. **Secondary Hypothyroidism**:
   - TSH: low or normal (occasionally raised)
   - FT4: <normal range

### Causes
- **Primary Hypothyroidism**:
  - Iodine deficiency
  - Autoimmune thyroiditis
  - Post-ablative therapy/surgery
  - Medications (e.g., amiodarone, lithium)
  - Transient thyroiditis
  - Thyroid infiltrative disorders

- **Secondary Hypothyroidism**:
  - Pituitary or hypothalamic disorders

### Complications
- Dyslipidaemia
- Metabolic syndrome
- Coronary heart disease and stroke
- Heart failure
- Neurological/cognitive impairments
- Adverse maternal and fetal outcomes in pregnancy

### Symptoms
- Fatigue
- Cold intolerance
- Weight gain
- Constipation
- Depression
- Symptoms may be mild and non-specific, especially in the elderly

### Assessment
1. **History**:
   - Symptoms, non-thyroidal illness, drug treatments, risk factors (family history, autoimmune diseases)

2. **Examination**:
   - Signs of hypothyroidism, thyroid enlargement, nodules, signs of other autoimmune diseases

3. **Tests**:
   - Serum TSH level; if raised, measure FT4.
   - Consider repeat TFTs if indicated.
   - Additional tests (e.g., thyroid peroxidase antibodies) if relevant.

### Management
#### Overt Hypothyroidism
- Emergency admission for myxoedema coma suspicion.
- Urgent referral to endocrinologist for suspected secondary hypothyroidism.
- Discuss specialist management with endocrinologist if needed.
- Offer information and support resources.
- Start treatment with levothyroxine (LT4) monotherapy.
  - Review symptoms and TFTs every 3 months; adjust LT4 dose as needed.
- Do not initiate liothyronine (LT3) alone, combination therapy, or natural thyroid extracts in primary care.
- Check TSH annually once stable.
- Investigate underlying causes for persistent symptoms or abnormal TFTs; refer to endocrinology if needed.

#### Subclinical Hypothyroidism
- Start LT4 monotherapy based on TSH level, age, and symptoms.
- Review symptoms and TFTs every 3 months; adjust LT4 dose as needed.
- Measure TSH and FT4 appropriately if untreated or LT4 has been stopped.

### Special Considerations for Referral to Endocrinology
- Women with overt/subclinical hypothyroidism who are:
  - Planning a pregnancy.
  - Pregnant (urgent TFTs and LT4 dose adjustment on specialist advice).
  - Postpartum and treated with LT4 during pregnancy.
  - Diagnosed with postpartum thyroiditis.
