## Dysmenorrhoea Summary

- **Definition**: Painful cramping in the lower abdomen shortly before and/or during menstruation.

### Types of Dysmenorrhoea
1. **Primary Dysmenorrhoea**
   - Occurs without identifiable pelvic pathology.
   - Caused by uterine prostaglandins leading to contractions and pain.
   - Common onset: 6–12 months after menarche, once cycles are regular.
   - Pain characteristics:
     - Starts shortly before menstruation.
     - Lasts up to 72 hours.
     - Typically lower abdominal, may radiate to the back and inner thigh.
     - Accompanied by non-gynaecological symptoms: vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, fatigue, irritability, dizziness, headache, lower back pain.
   - Prevalence: 16–91% among women of reproductive age.
   - Risk factors: Early menarche, heavy menstrual flow, nulliparity, family history.

2. **Secondary Dysmenorrhoea**
   - Caused by underlying pelvic pathology (e.g., endometriosis, fibroids, PID) or IUD insertion.
   - Typically starts after years of painless periods.
   - Pain characteristics:
     - Not consistently related to menstruation.
     - May persist after menstruation or be present throughout the cycle.
     - Often accompanied by other gynaecological symptoms (e.g., dyspareunia).
   - Pelvic examination may show abnormalities, but normal findings do not exclude this type.

### Clinical Features Indicating Serious Secondary Causes
- Positive pregnancy test with vaginal bleeding.
- Ascites or pelvic/abdominal mass (not due to fibroids).
- Abnormal cervix on examination.
- Persistent intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding without PID features.

### Treatment
- **Primary Dysmenorrhoea**:
  - Pain relief: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen), paracetamol.
  - Hormonal contraception (for those not wishing to conceive) as first-line treatment.
  - Additional options: Local heat application (hot water bottle, heat patch), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).
  - Referral to gynaecologist if severe symptoms persist after 3–6 months or if diagnosis is uncertain.

- **Secondary Dysmenorrhoea**:
  - Referral to secondary care for further investigation and management.
