## Anaemia - B12 and Folate Deficiency: Summary

- **Causes of Megaloblastic Anaemia**:
  - Deficiency of vitamin B12 or folate.
  - Characterized by:
    - Macrocytosis (larger than normal red blood cells).
    - Immature nuclei due to defective DNA synthesis.
    - Mean cell volume (MCV) > 100 femtolitres.

- **Vitamin B12 Deficiency**:
  - **Common Cause**: Pernicious anaemia (UK).
  - **Other Causes**:
    - **Drugs**: colchicine, metformin, nitrous oxide, proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor antagonists.
    - **Gastric**: total/partial gastrectomy, congenital intrinsic factor deficiency, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
    - **Inherited**: intrinsic factor receptor deficiency (Imerslund Gr√§sback syndrome).
    - **Intestinal**: malabsorption, ileal resection, Crohn's disease.
    - **Nutritional**: malnutrition, vegan diet.

- **Folate Deficiency**:
  - Often due to:
    - **Dietary Intake Issues**.
    - **Drug Causes**: alcohol, anticonvulsants, nitrofurantoin, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, trimethoprim.
    - **Excessive Requirements**: pregnancy, malignancy, blood disorders, malabsorption.
    - **Excessive Urinary Excretion**.
    - **Liver Disease**.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - History, examination, and investigations.
  - **Tests**:
    - Full blood count.
    - Blood film.
    - Serum folate, total B12 (serum cobalamin), or active B12 (serum holotranscobalamin).
    - Consider anti-intrinsic factor antibody test for suspected autoimmune gastritis.
    - If low folate and history suggests malabsorption, test for coeliac disease (anti-endomysial or anti-transglutaminase antibodies).

- **Treatment**:
  - **B12 Deficiency with Neurologic Involvement**:
    - Urgent specialist advice from a haematologist.
    - If unavailable, treat with hydroxocobalamin 1 mg IM on alternate days until no further improvement, then maintain every 2 months.
  - **B12 Deficiency (Other Causes)**:
    - **Medicine-Induced**: Offer IM/oral vitamin B12; review medication.
    - **Recreational Nitrous Oxide**: Offer IM/oral vitamin B12; advise to stop usage.
    - **Dietary Cause**: Oral vitamin B12 or IM if necessary.
      - IM hydroxocobalamin: Initial 1 mg IM three times a week for 2 weeks, then:
        - Not diet-related: Maintenance 1 mg IM every 2-3 months.
        - Diet-related: Cyanocobalamin tablets 50-150 mcg daily or twice-yearly IM hydroxocobalamin 1 mg.
  
  - **Folate Deficiency**:
    - Prescribe oral folic acid 5 mg daily (usually for 4 months).
    - Dietary advice: Good sources include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, asparagus, peas, chickpeas, brown rice.
