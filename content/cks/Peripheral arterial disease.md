## Peripheral Arterial Disease: Quick Revision Summary

### Definition
- **Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD):** Narrowing or occlusion of peripheral arteries, affecting blood supply to lower limbs.

### Types of Ischaemia
- **Acute Limb Ischaemia:** 
  - Sudden decrease in limb perfusion threatening viability (symptoms develop <2 weeks).
- **Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischaemia:**
  - Chronic, inadequate tissue perfusion at rest; defined by ischaemic rest pain, with or without tissue loss.
- **Intermittent Claudication:** 
  - Common symptom; pain in lower limb during walking/exercise, relieved by rest.
- **Asymptomatic PAD:** 
  - Early stage, may progress to claudication or chronic limb-threatening ischaemia.

### Causes
- **Most Common Cause:** [[Atherosclerosis]] (narrows arteries, limits blood flow).
- **Acute Limb Ischaemia Cause:** Sudden reduction in arterial perfusion, often due to thrombosis from ruptured atherosclerotic plaque.

### Risk Factors
- History of smoking
- Diabetes mellitus
- Hypertension
- Hypercholesterolaemia

### Symptoms
- **Acute Limb Ischaemia Features:**
  - Pain, pallor, pulselessness, coldness, paraesthesia, power loss.
- **Chronic Limb Ischaemia Features:**
  - Cramp-like pain in calf/thigh/buttock during walking, relieved by rest; unexplained foot/leg pain; non-healing wounds.

### Assessment
- Medical history, physical examination, and Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI).
- **ABPI â‰¤ 0.9:** Suggests presence of PAD.

### Management
- **Acute Limb Ischaemia:** 
  - Urgent vascular specialist assessment.
  
- **Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischaemia:**
  - Urgent referral to vascular multidisciplinary team.
  - Pain management.
  - Information and advice on condition and treatment options.

- **Intermittent Claudication:**
  - Supervised exercise program (if available).
  - Referral for angioplasty or bypass surgery (if needed).
  - Consider naftidrofuryl oxalate if no improvement post-exercise and patient prefers not to undergo surgery.
  - Information and advice on condition and treatment options.

### Prevention
- All individuals with PAD should receive information, advice, support, and treatment for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
