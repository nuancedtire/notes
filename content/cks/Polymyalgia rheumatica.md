### Polymyalgia Rheumatica (PMR) Summary

**Definition:**  
- PMR is a chronic, systemic, rheumatic inflammatory disease.
- Characterized by pain and morning stiffness in the neck, shoulder, and pelvic girdle.

**Cause:**  
- Unknown, but genetic and environmental factors may contribute.

**Risk Factors:**  
- **Older Age:** Highest incidence in those over 65; rare under 50.
- **Female Sex:** More common in women (lifetime risk: 2.4% for women, 1.7% for men).
- **Ancestry:** Northern European descent.
- **Infection:** Peaks in winter; associated with mycoplasma, chlamydia pneumonia, and parvovirus B19.

**Commonality:**  
- One of the most common inflammatory rheumatic diseases in older adults.
- Common indication for long-term corticosteroid treatment in the UK.

**Complications:**  
- **Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA):** May occur abruptly early in PMR.
- **Corticosteroid Treatment Complications.**

**Prognosis:**  
- Variable; rapid response to systemic corticosteroids is common.
- Treatment often needed for 1-2 years; some may require low-dose corticosteroids for several years.
- Relapse is common but usually responsive to corticosteroid adjustment.

**Diagnosis Indicators:**  
- **Age:** Older than 50.
- **Symptoms:** 
  - Bilateral shoulder and/or pelvic girdle pain lasting >2 weeks.
  - Morning stiffness lasting >45 minutes.
  - Evidence of acute phase response.
  - General symptoms: low-grade fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, depression.

**Diagnosis Approach:**  
- Combination of core features, exclusion of differential diagnoses (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia), positive corticosteroid response within a week, and normalization of inflammatory markers within 4 weeks.

**Referral to Rheumatologist:**  
- If atypical PMR features or poor corticosteroid response are evident.

**Management Strategies:**  
- Gradually reduce corticosteroid dosage when symptoms are controlled, adjusting as needed to avoid relapses.
- Manage symptoms of relapse, GCA, and corticosteroid side effects.
- Assess and manage osteoporosis risk.
- Provide appropriate information and advice.

**Referral Recommendations:**  
- If corticosteroids cannot be reduced without relapse.
- If corticosteroids are needed for more than 2 years.
