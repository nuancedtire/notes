## Gout: Summary

### Definition
- Gout is a type of arthritis caused by monosodium urate crystals in joints.
- Symptoms: Sudden severe pain, heat, swelling.

### Common Affected Joints
- Distal joints: toes, knees, ankles, finger joints.

### Major Risk Factor
- Hyperuricaemia (high uric acid levels).

### Additional Risk Factors
- Increasing age.
- Family history of hyperuricaemia and gout.
- Genetics.
- Excess body weight/obesity.
- Male sex.
- Diet: Excess alcohol, sugary drinks, meat, seafood.
- Menopausal status: More common in postmenopausal women.
- Certain medications (e.g., diuretics, low-dose aspirin, ciclosporin).
- Comorbidities: Chronic kidney disease (CKD), hypertension, diabetes mellitus.

### Complications
- Cardiovascular disease and mortality.
- Chronic arthritis.
- Chronic kidney disease.
- Joint damage.
- Reduced quality of life.
- Renal stones.
- Tophi.

### Suspected Diagnosis
- Rapid onset of severe pain, redness, swelling in one or both metatarsophalangeal joints.
- Presence of tophi.

### Assessment
- Medical history, physical examination, serum urate level measurement.
- Diagnosis confirmed with serum urate level â‰¥ 360 micromol/L (6 mg/dL).

### Management of Acute Attack
- Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or short course corticosteroids.
- Provide self-care advice.

### Urate-Lowering Therapy (ULT)
- Indicated for:
  - Multiple/troublesome flares.
  - CKD stages 3 to 5.
  - Diuretic therapy.
  - Tophi.
  - Chronic gouty arthritis.
- Discuss ULT with all patients experiencing flares.
- First-line options: Allopurinol or febuxostat, starting at low doses.
- Discuss benefits/risks of preventative medications (colchicine, NSAIDs, corticosteroids).
- Monthly serum urate checks until target range achieved; annual monitoring thereafter.

### Referrals
- Immediate referral if septic arthritis is suspected.
- Consider referral to rheumatology if:
  - Diagnosis of gout is uncertain.
  - Inadequate response to treatment or treatment not tolerated.
  - Treatment contraindicated.
  - CKD stages 3b to 5.
  - History of organ transplant.
