### Leg Ulcer - Venous: Summary

- **Definition**: 
  - A leg ulcer is a break in the skin below the knee that has not healed within 2 weeks.
  - Venous leg ulcers are the most common type, accounting for 60–80% of cases, typically found in the gaiter area (ankle to mid-calf).

- **Causes of Delayed Healing**:
  - Arterial disease
  - Diabetes
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
  - Vasculitis
  - Sickle cell disease
  - Malignancy
  - Drugs (e.g., nicorandil, corticosteroids, NSAIDs)

- **Pathophysiology**: 
  - Caused by sustained venous hypertension due to chronic venous insufficiency (venous valve incompetence or impaired calf muscle pump).

- **Risk Factors**: 
  - Obesity
  - Immobility
  - Increasing age
  - Varicose veins
  - History of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

- **Prevalence**: 
  - Estimated 0.1–0.3% in the UK, increasing with age.

- **Complications**: 
  - Chronic pain
  - Infection
  - Contact dermatitis from creams/dressings
  - Negative impacts on quality of life and daily functioning

- **Healing and Recurrence Rates**:
  - Six-month healing rates: 45% (community), 70% (specialist clinics).
  - Twelve-month recurrence rates: 26–69%.

- **Assessment**:
  - Symptoms: type, duration, severity.
  - Risk factors: immobility, history of DVT.
  - Wound examination: site, edge, size, depth, wound bed, signs of infection.
  - Legs examination: oedema, varicose veins, venous skin changes, reduced ankle mobility.
  - Measure ankle-brachial pressure index in both legs to exclude arterial insufficiency.

- **Primary Care Management**:
  - Clean and dress the wound.
  - Start compression therapy if appropriate.
  - Consider prescribing pentoxifylline to improve blood flow and healing.
  - Manage associated conditions (oedema, venous eczema).
  - Manage complications (pain, infection).
  - Provide lifestyle advice (e.g., compliance with compression, regular walking, leg elevation, avoiding trauma).
  - Arrange follow-up to reassess the ulcer.
  - Refer to specialists if needed (uncertain diagnosis, suspected alternative causes, delayed healing after 2 weeks).

- **Post-Healing Recommendations**:
  - Long-term use of below-knee graduated compression hosiery recommended.
  - Encourage lifestyle measures.
  - Appropriate reviews should be scheduled.
