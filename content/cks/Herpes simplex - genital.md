### Summary of Genital Herpes (Herpes Simplex)

- **Definition**: Genital herpes is an infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).
  
- **Types of HSV**:
  - **HSV-1**: Commonly causes oro-labial and genital herpes in the UK.
  - **HSV-2**: More likely to cause recurrent genital herpes.

- **Transmission**:
  - Acquired via direct sexual contact at mucosal surfaces or skin breaks.
  - Rarely, through contact with lesions elsewhere (e.g., eyes, fingers).

- **Primary Infection**:
  - Usually asymptomatic for the majority with HSV-2.
  - The virus becomes latent in local sensory ganglia post-infection.

- **Recurrent Genital Herpes**:
  - Symptoms arise from reactivation of the virus after a latent period.
  - Can cause symptomatic lesions or asymptomatic viral shedding, posing a risk of transmission.

- **Complications**:
  - Psychosocial impact.
  - Secondary infections of lesions.
  - Autoinoculation (transmission to fingers or other sites).
  - Herpes proctitis.
  - Urinary retention.
  - Systemic infection.
  - Neonatal transmission.

- **Recurrence**:
  - Average of 4-5 recurrences per year after the first symptomatic episode.
  - Symptoms typically reduce in severity and frequency over time.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Suspected if a person presents with:
    - Multiple painful vesicles, blisters, or ulcers in genital/perineal regions.
    - Dysuria, discharge, systemic symptoms, tender bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy.
    - Prodromal tingling/pain in genital area, back, buttocks, or thighs up to 48 hours prior to lesions in recurrent episodes.
    - Milder, unilateral, localized lesions in recurrent episodes.

- **Assessment**:
  - Inquire about:
    - Onset, duration, and impact of symptoms.
    - Previous episodes, sexual partner(s), risk factors, and treatment history.
    - Consider viral swab from anogenital lesions and screening for other STIs if necessary.

- **Management**:
  - Advise on:
    - Information sources, support, self-care measures.
    - Minimizing transmission risk.
    - Oral antiviral treatment options and review if unable to attend specialist services.
    - Episodic oral antiviral treatment for acute episodes or suppressive treatment for recurrent herpes.
  
- **Referral Criteria**:
  - Refer if:
    - Severely unwell or suspected serious complication.
    - Uncertain diagnosis.
    - No response to primary care treatment.
    - Pregnant (urgent referral needed for suspected first episode).
    - Immunocompromised with severe symptoms or new lesions during treatment.
    - Breakthrough recurrent episodes while on suppressive treatment.
