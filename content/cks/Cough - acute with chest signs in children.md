## Cough - Acute with Chest Signs in Children: Summary

### Key Considerations
- **Upper Respiratory Tract Infection**: Consider if cough presents with symptoms/signs of infection and clear chest on examination.
- **Common Causes**:
  - Pneumonia
  - Viral-induced wheeze
  - Infective exacerbation of asthma
  - COVID-19

### Viral-Induced Wheeze
- Affects children aged 6 months to 5 years.
- Associated with respiratory tract infection.

### Infective Exacerbations of Asthma
- Can be similar to viral-induced wheeze.
- Wheezing due to bronchoconstriction from infection.

### Bronchiolitis
- Primarily affects infants under 12 months.
- Caused by viral infections (most commonly respiratory syncytial virus).
- Symptoms: Increased respiratory rate, wheeze, hyperinflation, fine crackles.

### Community-Acquired Pneumonia
- Caused by bacteria or viruses.
- Signs to consider:
  - Fever
  - Respiratory rate >60 breaths/min
  - Increased work of breathing
  - Crackles in chest
  - Cyanosis

### Assessment of Respiratory Symptoms
- **Observations**:
  - Degree of agitation/consciousness (signs of hypoxia).
  - Signs of exhaustion, cyanosis, accessory muscle use at rest.
- **Examination**:
  - Chest examination, respiratory rate, pulse, blood pressure.
  - Oxygen saturation (pulse oximetry).
  - Peak expiratory flow rate (for viral-induced wheeze/asthma exacerbation).
  - Hydration status.

### Urgent Hospital Admission Indicators
- **Critical Signs**:
  - RR >60-70 breaths/min
  - Apnoea or grunting
  - Moderate/severe chest indrawing
  - Cyanosis
  - Unresponsive to social cues/rousal
  - Appears ill
  - Clinical dehydration
  - Age <3 months with temp ≥38°C, or age >3 months with temp >39°C
  - Peak expiratory flow <50% best/predicted
  - Oxygen saturation ≤90% (≤92% for infants <6 weeks or with underlying health issues)

### Additional Hospital Admission Considerations
- Age 6-12 months with RR 50-60 breaths/min
- Age >12 months with RR 40-60 breaths/min
- Nasal flaring, crackles
- Oxygen saturation ≤92%
- Pallor reported by caregiver
- Poor response to social cues or decreased activity
- Poor feeding in infants (<50% normal fluid intake in 24 hours)
- Dry mucous membranes, reduced urine output
- Capillary refill time ≥3 seconds

### Low-Risk Assessment
- Children deemed low risk may be treated at home.
- Parents/caregivers should be advised on when to seek further medical advice if deterioration occurs.
