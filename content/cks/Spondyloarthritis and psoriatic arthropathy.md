## Spondyloarthritis Overview

- **Definition**: A group of inflammatory rheumatologic conditions; can be axial (affecting sacroiliac joints and spine) or peripheral.
- **Types**:
  - **Psoriatic Arthritis**: Affects up to 25% of people with psoriasis; predominantly peripheral.
  - **Axial Spondyloarthritis**: Affects the axial skeleton; includes:
    - Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis
    - Radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis)

- **Other Types**: Reactive arthritis, enteropathic arthritis.

## Causes
- Thought to involve genetic and environmental factors.

## Features

- **Axial Spondyloarthritis**:
  - Chronic/recurrent inflammatory back pain.
  - Stiffness that improves with exercise.
  
- **Peripheral Spondyloarthritis (e.g., Psoriatic Arthropathy)**:
  - Asymmetric arthritis.
  - Enthesitis (inflammation of tendon/ligament insertion points).
  - Dactylitis (swelling of fingers/toes).

- **Overlap**: Individuals may experience features from both subtypes.

## Extra-Articular Manifestations
- Anterior uveitis.
- Inflammatory bowel disease.
- Psoriasis.
- Fatigue.

## Complications
- Progressive, irreversible joint damage.
- Decreased quality of life and physical function.
- Depression and anxiety.
- Cardiovascular disease.
- Adverse effects from medications.

## Risks Associated with Axial Spondyloarthritis
- Osteoporosis.
- Ankylosis/spinal fusion due to new bone formation.
- Spinal fractures.
- Hip and large joint involvement (potential for joint replacement).

## Management

### Referral to Rheumatologist
- Confirm diagnosis.
- Review treatment and adjust medications (e.g., DMARDs, corticosteroids).
- Refer for physiotherapy and occupational therapy if needed.
- Arrange osteoporosis assessments (every 2 years).
- Follow-up and monitoring, possibly in coordination with primary care.

### Primary Care Physician Role
- Ongoing follow-up: Monitor disease activity, progression, and treatment response.
- Manage modifiable cardiovascular risk factors.
- Ensure osteoporosis assessments for axial spondyloarthritis patients every 2 years.
- Refer for specific symptoms (e.g., anterior uveitis, vertebral fractures).
- Review medications for women planning pregnancy or during unplanned pregnancies.
