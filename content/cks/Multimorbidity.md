## Multimorbidity Summary

**Definition:**
- Multimorbidity is the presence of two or more long-term health conditions, which can include:
  - Defined physical or mental health conditions (e.g., diabetes, schizophrenia).
  - Ongoing conditions (e.g., learning disability).
  - Symptom complexes (e.g., frailty, chronic pain).
  - Sensory impairments (e.g., sight or hearing loss).
  - Alcohol or substance misuse.

**Prevalence:**
- Approximately 30% globally, increasing with age and socioeconomic deprivation; nearly universal in older adults.

**Associated Issues:**
- Reduced quality of life.
- Reduced life expectancy.
- High treatment burden.
- Mental health difficulties (e.g., anxiety, depression).
- Fragmentation and coordination problems in care.
- Functional difficulties.
- Polypharmacy and higher rates of adverse drug events.
- Increased use of health services (including emergency care).
- Poorer quality of life for families/carers.

**Identification:**
- Conduct opportunistic or proactive identification using healthcare records.
- Consider validated tools like the electronic frailty index (eFI).

**Multimorbidity Approach Considerations:**
- For individuals who:
  - Struggle to manage treatments or daily activities.
  - Receive care from multiple services and need additional support.
  - Have both long-term physical and mental health conditions.
  - Are frail or at risk of falls.
  - Frequently seek unplanned or emergency care.
  - Are prescribed 10+ regular medicines or at risk with fewer than 10.

**Assessment:**
- Establish disease burden and treatment burden.
- Explore attitudes toward treatments and potential benefits/harms.
- Consider social circumstances, health literacy, functional autonomy, and coping strategies.
- Be alert to depression, anxiety, and chronic pain.
- Encourage clarification of personal goals, values, and priorities.
- Discuss involvement of partners, family, and/or carers in management decisions.
- Assess frailty if necessary.

**Management Focus:**
- Interactions between health conditions and treatments affecting quality of life.
- Individual needs, treatment preferences, health priorities, lifestyle, and goals.
- Benefits and risks of guidance on single health conditions.
- Reducing treatment burden, adverse events, and unplanned care.
- Improving coordination of care across services.

**Management Steps:**
1. Discuss the purpose of a multimorbidity approach.
2. Review medicines/treatments considering evidence of benefits/harms.
3. Develop and agree on an individualized management plan.
