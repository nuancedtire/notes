## Hiccups Summary

- **Definition**: Involuntary diaphragmatic contraction causing sudden inspiration; air intake is halted by glottis closure, producing a characteristic sound.
- **Function**: No known useful or protective function.

### Types of Hiccups
- **Transient Hiccups**: 
  - Duration: Less than 48 hours.
- **Persistent/Protracted Hiccups**: 
  - Duration: More than 48 hours; may lead to complications (fatigue, weight loss).

### Assessment
- If hiccups last over 48 hours, perform a full assessment to identify potential underlying causes, which may require referral to secondary care.

### Investigations in Primary Care
- **Full Blood Count**: 
  - Abnormal findings may indicate leukocytosis (inflammation/infection) or anemia (malignancy/GI hemorrhage).
- **Urea and Electrolytes**: 
  - Exclude uraemia, hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia.
- **ESR or C-reactive Protein**: 
  - Elevated levels suggest underlying disease.
- **Liver Function Tests**: 
  - Abnormal results may indicate hepatitis or liver metastases.
- **Electrocardiogram**: 
  - Exclude pericarditis or recent myocardial infarction.
- **Chest Radiograph**: 
  - Exclude lung pathology.

### Management of Hiccups

#### Recurrent Short Episodes
- **Avoiding Triggers**: Identify and avoid factors that trigger hiccups.
- **Self-Help Remedies**:
  - **Stimulation of Nasopharynx**: 
    - Sipping iced water, swallowing granulated sugar, tasting vinegar, biting on a lemon.
  - **Interruption of Respiratory Function**: 
    - Valsalva maneuver, breath holding, hyperventilation, breathing into a paper bag, sneezing.
  - **Counter-Irritation of Diaphragm**: 
    - Pulling knees up to the chest.

#### Persistent/Intractable Hiccups
- **Advice**: Continue to avoid triggers and suggest self-help remedies.
- **Management of Underlying Cause**: 
  - In primary or secondary care.
- **If No Cause Identified**:
  - Hypnotherapy, acupuncture, psychotherapy.
  - Techniques to interrupt the hiccup reflex arc (may require specialist referral).
  - Consider specialist referral for pharmacotherapy initiation.
  - Potential referral for phrenic nerve disruption.

### Follow-Up
- Determine follow-up intervals based on clinical judgment.
- Advise patients to report complications: cardiac arrhythmias, insomnia, weight loss, oesophagitis.
