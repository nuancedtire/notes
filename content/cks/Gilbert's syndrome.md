## Gilbert's Syndrome Summary

- **Definition**: Inherited metabolic disorder (usually autosomal recessive) characterized by intermittent elevation of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin due to defective liver conjugating enzymes.

- **Jaundice Episodes**: 
  - Can be precipitated by:
    - Physical/psychological stress
    - Dieting/fasting
    - Surgery
    - Dehydration
    - Alcohol ingestion
    - Infectious illness
    - Heavy physical exertion
    - Lack of sleep
  - Typically self-limiting and resolves in a few days.

- **Prognosis**: 
  - Does not progress to chronic liver disease.
  - Normal life expectancy.

- **Prevalence**: 
  - Common cause of isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia.
  - Affects 5–10% of the population in Western Europe; many cases are undiagnosed.
  - At least 30% of affected individuals remain asymptomatic.

- **When to Suspect Gilbert's Syndrome**: 
  - Increased serum bilirubin concentration (typically ≤68-85 micromol/L or 4 mg/dL) with normal liver function tests (LFTs).
  - Mild jaundice episodes without clinical liver disease, associated with:
    - Heavy exertion
    - Fasting
    - Surgery
    - Dehydration
    - Illness
    - Alcohol ingestion
    - Lack of sleep.

- **Symptoms**: 
  - Generally asymptomatic; if symptoms like abdominal pain, itch, pale stools, or dark urine are present, consider alternative diagnoses.

- **Other Causes of Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinaemia**:
  - Hemolysis (e.g., autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell disease).
  - Genetic conditions (e.g., Crigler-Najjar syndrome).
  - Drugs (e.g., methyldopa, sulfasalazine, rifampicin).

- **Examination Findings**: 
  - Mild jaundice may be present; no hepatosplenomegaly or chronic liver disease signs.

- **Diagnosis Criteria**:
  - Confirmed unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia on multiple occasions.
  - Normal LFTs.
  - No evidence of hemolysis (normal full blood count, reticulocytes, lactate dehydrogenase, blood film).
  - No other liver disease causes.
  - Recurrent, self-resolving jaundice episodes.

- **Patient Guidance**:
  - No treatment or regular monitoring required.
  - Condition cannot progress to chronic liver disease.
  - Episodes of jaundice are self-limiting and not indicative of serious illness or infection.
  - Seek medical advice if jaundice is severe or persistent, as this may indicate an alternative diagnosis.
