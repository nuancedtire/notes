## Whooping Cough: Summary

- **Definition**: Whooping cough (pertussis) is a highly infectious disease caused by the bacterium *Bordetella pertussis*.
- **Transmission**: Spread via respiratory secretions.
- **Incubation Period**: Approximately 7–10 days.
- **Infectious Period**: Up to 21 days from the onset of symptoms if untreated.
- **Prevention**: Primarily through vaccination.

### Phases of Symptoms

1. **Catarrhal Phase**
   - Duration: 1–2 weeks
   - Symptoms: Similar to upper respiratory infection (rhinorrhoea, malaise, mild cough).
   - Fever: Uncommon and low-grade.

2. **Paroxysmal Phase**
   - Duration: Approximately 1 week
   - Symptoms: Bouts of rapid, violent coughing followed by a characteristic 'whoop' (sharp inhalation) and/or post-tussive vomiting.
   - Note: 'Whoop' is less common in adults and young infants (who may have apnoea).

3. **Convalescent Phase**
   - Duration: 2–3 weeks
   - Symptoms: Gradual improvement in cough frequency and severity; paroxysms can recur with subsequent respiratory infections.

### Immunity
- Individuals with immunity (from vaccination or natural infection) may have shorter, milder symptoms, but do not have lifelong protection.

### Special Considerations
- Infants (younger than 6 months) may have atypical illness, high hospitalization rates, severe illness, and death.

### Clinical Suspicions for Whooping Cough
- Acute cough lasting 14 days or more without an apparent cause, plus one or more of:
  - Paroxysmal cough
  - Inspiratory 'whoop'
  - Post-tussive vomiting
  - Undiagnosed apnoea (in young infants)
  
- Contact with a confirmed case within the last 21 days or known outbreak in a specific group (e.g., school).

### Reporting
- Whooping cough is a notifiable disease; notify local Public Health England within 3 days if suspected.

### Management
- Admit individuals with life-threatening infections or complications (especially children ≤6 months).
- Prescribe antibiotics if cough onset is within the last 21 days.
- Provide self-care advice (simple analgesia for relief).
- Manage close contacts.
- Ensure outstanding vaccinations are administered.

### Exclusion Guidelines
- Children and healthcare workers with suspected/confirmed whooping cough should stay off nursery, school, or work until:
  - 48 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment completed, or
  - 21 days from onset of symptoms if untreated.

- Other workers should avoid contact with unvaccinated or partially vaccinated infants until:
  - 48 hours of appropriate antibiotic treatment completed, or
  - 21 days from onset of symptoms if untreated.
