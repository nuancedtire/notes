## Coeliac Disease Summary

### Definition
- Chronic immune-mediated systemic disorder.
- Triggered by dietary gluten (found in wheat, barley, rye).
  
### Types
- **Non-responsive coeliac disease**: Persistent symptoms and enteropathy after 6â€“12 months on a gluten-free diet.
- **Refractory coeliac disease**: Persistent/recurrent symptoms and villous atrophy despite strict adherence to a gluten-free diet for at least 12 months.

### Prevalence
- Approximately 1% in Europe; many cases remain undiagnosed.

### Complications of Undiagnosed or Untreated Disease
- Reduced quality of life
- Faltering growth in children
- Nutritional deficiencies (e.g., anaemia)
- Reduced bone mineral density
- Hyposplenism
- Malignancies (small bowel adenocarcinoma, lymphoma)
- Refractory coeliac disease

### Symptoms Indicating Suspected Coeliac Disease
- Persistent, unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms
- Irritable bowel syndrome
- Faltering growth, idiopathic short stature, delayed puberty in children
- Prolonged fatigue
- Persistent/recurrent mouth ulcers
- Unexplained iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency
- Type 1 diabetes mellitus
- Autoimmune thyroid disease
- Autoimmune liver disease
- Selective IgA deficiency
- First-degree relative with coeliac disease
- Suspected dermatitis herpetiformis

### Additional Considerations
- Unexplained depression/anxiety
- Osteomalacia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, fragility fractures
- Unexplained peripheral neuropathy or ataxia
- Unexplained recurrent miscarriage or subfertility
- Persistently raised liver transaminases
- Dental enamel defects
- Hyposplenism or asplenia
- Genetic conditions (Down's syndrome, Turner syndrome, Williams syndrome)

### Assessment
1. **History**: Symptoms, family history, risk factors, complications, associated conditions.
2. **Physical examination**: Height, weight, abdominal examination, skin assessment.
3. **Testing**:
   - Coeliac serology testing (ensure gluten consumption for 6 weeks prior).
   - Gastroenterology referral for endoscopic intestinal biopsy if serology suggests diagnosis.
   - Specialist tests if serology is negative but clinical suspicion is high.

### Management
- Education on long-term adherence to a gluten-free diet.
- Provide information and support.
- Assess for persistent or recurrent symptoms despite adherence.
- Monitor growth and nutritional status.
- Regular blood monitoring for nutritional deficiencies.
- Assess for complications or associated conditions.
- Refer to a dietitian for dietary adherence and nutritional advice.
- Refer to specialists for suspected non-responsive or refractory disease or serious complications.
- Offer immunizations (influenza, meningococcal, pneumococcal) for individuals with hyposplenism.
