- **Dupuytren's Disease Overview**: 
  - Benign, progressive fibroproliferative condition affecting hand and finger fascia.
  - Leads to disabling contractures; 75% develop advanced disease features.

- **Typical Features**:
  - Thickening of connective tissue in the palm (nodules).
  - Development of cords extending towards fingers.
  - Cords can lead to flexion contracture (Dupuytren’s contracture) over time.

- **Progression**:
  - Varies individually; faster in men and those under 50.
  - Typically affects both hands.
  - Most commonly involves fourth and fifth fingers; thumb and index finger often spared.

- **Etiology**:
  - Cause is unknown.
  - Risk factors: 
    - Increasing age
    - Male sex
    - Positive family history
    - Northern European descent
    - Linked to diabetes mellitus, smoking, high alcohol consumption, epilepsy.

- **Assessment**:
  - Thorough history: risk factors, loss of function, ectopic lesions.
  - Physical examination: 
    - Check for thickening, pitting palmar skin, nodules, cords, contractures.
    - Perform ‘tabletop’ test to identify contractures.
  - Referral to hand surgeon or specialist if contracture or reduced hand function is present.

- **Surgical Options**:
  - Needle fasciotomy
  - Fasciectomy
  - Dermofasciectomy
  - Other treatments: radiotherapy, corticosteroid injections.
  
- **Surgical Outcomes**:
  - Surgical correction improves hand functionality but does not halt disease progression.
  - Risk of recurrence at the same site or elsewhere in the hand.
  - 10-year re-operation risk:
    - ~20% after limited fasciectomy or dermofasciectomy.
    - ~33% after percutaneous needle fasciotomy.
