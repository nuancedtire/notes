### Sleep Disorders: Shift Work and Jet Lag

#### Overview
- **Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders**: 
  - Shift Work Disorder (SWD)
  - Jet Lag Disorder (JLD)
- **Definition**: Persistent/recurrent sleep disturbance due to:
  - Changes in circadian system
  - Misalignment between internal circadian rhythm and external factors

#### Shift Work Disorder (SWD)
- **Causes**: Difficulty adjusting to varying sleep/wake schedules due to shift work.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Sleep disturbance before/after shifts
  - Excessive sleepiness and fatigue during shifts
- **Risks**:
  - Chronic sleep disturbance
  - Cognitive impairment
  - Depression
  - Reduced performance and increased accidents
  - Cardiometabolic conditions
  - Cancer and cardiovascular death

#### Jet Lag Disorder (JLD)
- **Causes**: Travel across time zones leading to misalignment of sleep/wake cycles.
- **Risks**:
  - Excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue
  - Cognitive impairment
  - Gastrointestinal and bladder disturbances

#### Sleep Promotion Measures
- **Environment**: Create a cool, quiet, dark sleeping space.
- **Routine**: Appropriate meal timing and physical activity.
- **Substances**: Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol at least 3 hours before sleep.
- **Relaxation**: Engage in relaxing activities before bed.

- **Hypnotic Drugs**: Short-acting hypnotic drugs are not routinely recommended.

#### Management of SWD
- **Support**: Provide information and resources.
- **Sleep Diary**: Use a sleep diary to assess disturbances.
- **Breaks/Naps**: Take regular breaks and short naps.
- **Light Exposure**: Get bright light exposure during shifts; avoid bright light on the way home.
- **Work Schedules**: Advise on optimal work schedules and environment.
- **Driving**: Do not drive if feeling drowsy after shifts.
- **Psychosocial Management**: Address any underlying stress, anxiety, or depression.
- **Referral**: Consider referral to a local sleep clinic if needed.

#### Management of JLD
- **Support**: Provide information and resources.
- **Minimize Stressors**: Reduce stress before, during, and after travel.
- **Short Trips**: Maintain 'home time' sleeping/eating routines.
- **Long Trips**: Maximize pre-flight sleep; adjust bedtimes; adopt destination schedule during flight.
- **In-Flight Tips**: Eat light meals, stay hydrated, limit alcohol, sleep as much as possible.
- **At Destination**: Maximize sleep, take naps as needed, and ensure exposure to light/darkness timely.
