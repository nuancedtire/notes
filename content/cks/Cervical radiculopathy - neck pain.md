## Neck Pain - Cervical Radiculopathy: Quick Revision Summary

- **Definition**: 
  - Radiculopathy: Neurological condition with limited/block conduction along a spinal nerve or its roots.
  - Differentiation: Distinct from radicular pain, although they often coexist.

- **Causes**: 
  - Commonly due to:
    - Cervical disc herniation.
    - Degenerative spondylotic changes.
  - Possible without evident compression (e.g., inflammation).

- **Symptoms**: 
  - Pain and weakness/numbness in one or both upper extremities (corresponding to the affected cervical nerve root dermatome).
  - Associated neck pain from nerve root compression or irritation.
  - Possible pain in shoulders, upper back, and chest.

- **Prevalence**: 
  - Most common in individuals aged 50–54 years.
  - Annual incidence:
    - Men: 107 per 100,000.
    - Women: 64 per 100,000.

- **Prognosis**: 
  - Most individuals improve with time; ~88% improve within four weeks with non-operative management.

- **Assessment**: 
  1. Exclude red flags for serious spinal pathology.
  2. Symptom inquiry.
  3. Physical examination for signs of radiculopathy.
  
- **Diagnostic Tests**:
  - **Positive findings increase likelihood of cervical radiculopathy**:
    - Spurling test.
    - Arm squeeze test.
    - Axial traction test.
  - **Tests to rule out cervical radiculopathy**:
    - Upper limb neurodynamic tests combined with arm squeeze test.
  - **Imaging**: 
    - Cervical X-rays and other imaging not routinely required unless red flags present.

- **Management**:
  - **For neck pain < 4–6 weeks & no neurological signs**:
    - Reassurance, information, and advice.
    - Oral analgesia.
    - Consider medications: amitriptyline, duloxetine, pregabalin, gabapentin.
    - Possible physiotherapy referral.
  
  - **For cervical radiculopathy ≥ 4–6 weeks or with neurological signs**:
    - Referral for MRI.
    - Consider invasive procedures:
      - Interlaminar cervical epidural injections.
      - Transforaminal injections.
      - Spinal surgery.
