- **Definition of Limp**: An asymmetric gait that deviates from a normal age-appropriate pattern. It is a clinical presentation, not a diagnosis, often due to pain, weakness, or deformity.

- **Causes**: Can range from mild (e.g., transient synovitis) to severe (e.g., septic arthritis, malignancy).

- **Differential Diagnoses by Age**: Serious conditions may occur at any age but have different presentations based on age group.

- **Initial Assessment**:
  - Detailed history and physical examination are essential.
  
- **Red Flags Indicating Serious Conditions**:
  - **Pain waking at night**: Possible malignancy.
  - **Redness, swelling, stiffness**: Possible infection or inflammatory joint disease.
  - **Weight loss, anorexia, fever, night sweats, fatigue**: Possible malignancy, infection, or inflammation.
  - **Unexplained rash or bruising**: Possible haematological/inflammatory joint disease or maltreatment.
  - **Morning stiffness**: Possible inflammatory joint disease.
  - **Inability to bear weight or painful range of motion**: Possible trauma or infection.
  - **Severe pain, anxiety after injury**: Possible neurovascular compromise or compartment syndrome.
  - **Palpable mass**: Possible malignancy or infection.

- **Urgent Specialist Referral**:
  - Fever and/or red flags suggesting serious pathology.
  - Suspected maltreatment.
  - Under 3 years old (transient synovitis rare; septic arthritis more common).
  - Over 9 years old with painful or restricted hip movements (to exclude slipped upper femoral epiphysis).

- **Specialist Assessment** (urgency based on clinical judgement):
  - If the limp's cause cannot be managed in primary care.
  - If there is uncertainty about the limpâ€™s cause.
  - If the child presents with a limp on multiple occasions.

- **Management of Transient Synovitis**:
  - Can be managed in primary care.
  - Advise rest and simple analgesia.
  - Parents/carers should seek immediate care if symptoms worsen, fever develops, or the child is unable to weight bear.

- **Follow-Up**:
  - If symptoms improve within 48 hours, review 1 week from symptom onset.
  - If symptoms worsen or do not resolve, arrange urgent hospital assessment.
  
- **Imaging**:
  - If trauma or focal bony tenderness is present, X-ray is needed.
  - Persistent limp with normal initial X-ray should be referred to paediatric orthopaedics or rheumatology for further investigation (urgency based on clinical judgement).
