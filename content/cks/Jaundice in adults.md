    - Malaria
    - Gilbert’s syndrome
    - Crigler-Najjar syndrome
  - **Intra-hepatic**: 
    - Viral hepatitis

    - Dubin-Johnson syndrome
    - Rotor’s syndrome
    - Drugs
    - Biliary malignancy
  - **Post-hepatic**: 
    - [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|Gallstones]]
    - Surgical strictures
    - Extra-hepatic malignancy
    - Pancreatitis
    - Parasitic infections

### Epidemiology
- Incidence in UK primary care: ~56 per 100,000 people.
- Rare in general practice but often indicates serious underlying conditions.

### Important Causes in the UK
- Malignancy
- Alcohol
- Gallstone disease

### Assessment
1. **History**:
   - Duration and previous episodes of jaundice
   - Changes in stools and urine
   - Itching
   - Pain characteristics
   - Systemic symptoms (fever, rigors, etc.)
   - Travel history
   - IV drug use or blood transfusion history
   - Exposure to hepatotoxic drugs
   - Occupation

2. **Examination**:
   - Vital signs
   - Signs of chronic liver disease
   - Lymphadenopathy
   - Abdominal masses, tenderness, or ascites

3. **Investigations**:
   - Urine sample for bilirubin
   - Blood tests (FBC, liver function tests, urea and electrolytes, clotting, hepatitis screening)

### Red Flags
- Signs of hepatic encephalopathy (confusion)
- Hepatic dysfunction (bruising)
- Gastrointestinal blood loss and sepsis
- Marked abdominal pain or tenderness
- Vomiting
- Weight loss
- Suspicion of paracetamol overdose

### Referral and Admission Guidelines
- **Admit for same-day assessment if**:
  - Acutely unwell (suspected encephalopathy or fever)
  - Suspected cholangitis
  - Bilirubin > 100 micromol/L
  - Abnormal renal function or dehydration
  - Abnormal clotting profile
  - Frail or significant comorbidities
  - Suspected paracetamol overdose

- **Refer to secondary care if**:
  - Malignancy suspected (using suspected cancer pathway, 2-week appointment)
  - Blood tests show cholestatic or obstructive picture
  - Blood tests show hepatitic picture
  - Alcohol-related liver disease suspected
  - Inherited or autoimmune liver disease suspected

- **Management in primary care**: 
  - Well patients diagnosed with hepatitis A or Gilbert’s syndrome.
