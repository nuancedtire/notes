### Shingles Overview

- **Definition**: Shingles (herpes zoster) is a viral infection affecting an individual nerve and the skin surface (dermatome) associated with that nerve, caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (chickenpox).

### Incidence and Risk Factors

- **Age**: Incidence and severity increase with age.
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Immunocompromise (e.g., long-term corticosteroid use, HIV, lymphoproliferative malignancies, chemotherapy)
  - Certain comorbidities (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, asthma)
  - Psychological factors
  - Female sex

### Complications

- **Post-Herpetic Neuralgia**: Most common complication; pain persists for more than 90 days post-rash onset. More common in older individuals.
- **Other Complications**:
  - Secondary infection
  - Scarring
  - Ocular complications
  - Disseminated disease

### Assessment

- **Symptoms Inquiry**: Location, duration, and severity of symptoms.
- **Risk Factor Identification**: Assess for immunocompromise.
- **Physical Examination**: Look for clinical features of shingles and rule out differential diagnoses (e.g., herpes simplex virus, contact dermatitis).
- **Diagnosis**: Typically made on clinical grounds.

### Clinical Features

- **Prodromal Period**: Abnormal skin sensations and pain.
- **Rash**: Unilateral vesicular rash in the affected dermatome.
  - **Common Locations**: Thorax, dermatomes T1 to L2 in immunocompetent individuals.
  - **Immunocompromised Individuals**: Widespread symptoms affecting multiple dermatomes.
  - **Atypical Rash**: May be non-vesicular in older adults or severe/long-lasting in immunocompromised individuals.

### Management

- **Assessment**: Guides management decisions.
- **Referral**: Hospital admission or specialist advice for severely immunocompromised, ophthalmic involvement, systemic illness, severe/widespread rash, or immunocompromised children.
- **Treatment**:
  - Oral antiviral medication, if appropriate.
  - Pain management.
- **Self-Care Advice**:
  - Avoid contact with uninfected individuals (especially high-risk groups).
  - Keep rash clean and dry; cover weeping lesions.
  - Stay away from work/school/day care if the rash is weeping and cannot be covered.
- **Referral Considerations**: If antiviral treatment is needed in pregnant/breastfeeding women, new vesicles form after 7 days of antiviral treatment, healing is delayed, shingles recurs, or pain is poorly controlled.

### Vaccination

- **UK Program**: Shingles vaccination for individuals aged 60 years and older, eligible until their 80th birthday, due to higher incidence and severity in this age group.
