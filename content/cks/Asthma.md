## Asthma Summary

- **Definition**: Chronic inflammatory condition of the airways; hyper-responsive airways that constrict easily.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Coughing
  - Wheezing
  - Chest tightness
  - Shortness of breath
  - Symptoms may worsen at night/early morning, with exercise, allergen exposure, cold air, or certain medications (NSAIDs, beta-blockers).

- **Prevalence**: 5.4 million people in the UK receiving treatment (British Lung Foundation).

- **Diagnosis Indicators**:
  - Wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness, cough.
  - History of atopic disorders.
  - Widespread wheeze (bilateral, predominantly expiratory).
  - Symptoms in the absence of upper respiratory infections.

- **Diagnostic Tests**:
  - **FeNO testing** (fractional exhaled nitric oxide)
  - **Spirometry**
  - **Bronchodilator Reversibility (BDR)**
  - **Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF)**
  - **Bronchial Challenge Testing** (with histamine or methacholine)
  
- **Treatment**:
  - **Relief Bronchodilator**: Inhaled short-acting beta-2 agonist as needed.
  - **Stepwise Treatment**:
    - Low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for adults/children.
    - Add-on therapies: leukotriene receptor antagonist, long-acting inhaled beta-2 agonist, maintenance and reliever therapy, increased ICS doses, theophylline, long-acting muscarinic agents.
    - Referral to a respiratory specialist if symptoms are uncontrolled; lower threshold for children.
    - Consider alternative diagnosis if treatment fails.

- **Follow-Up**:
  - Annual follow-up for all asthma patients.
  - Closer monitoring for those with poor lung function, recent asthma attacks, treatment adjustments, or increased risk factors (non-adherence, psychosocial issues, frequent unscheduled care).
