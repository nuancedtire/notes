### Undescended Testes (Cryptorchidism) Overview

- **Definition**: Incomplete descent of one or both testes from the abdomen through the inguinal canal, resulting in absence from the scrotum.
- **Prevalence**: Bilateral in up to 30% of cases; about 80% are palpable.

### Classifications of Undescended Testes:
1. **True Undescended Testis**: Testis along the normal descent path but never in the scrotum.
2. **Ectopic Testis**: Testis outside the normal path of descent and outside the scrotum (e.g., femoral region, perineum).
3. **Ascending Testis**: Testis previously in the scrotum that has moved to a higher position.
4. **Absent or Atrophic Testis**: Testis in the scrotum at birth but later disappears, resulting in a non-palpable testis.

### Risk Factors:
- Family history of undescended testes
- Low birth weight and small for gestational age
- Preterm delivery
- Endocrine disorders (e.g., congenital adrenal hyperplasia)
- Disorders of sexual development
- Maternal smoking

### Possible Complications:
- Impaired fertility
- Increased risk of testicular cancer in undescended testis
- Increased risk of testicular torsion
- Increased risk of inguinal hernia

### Assessment:
- **History**: Inquire about gestational age, risk factors, and palpability of the testis in the scrotum.
- **Physical Examination**: 
  - Conduct in a warm environment with warm hands.
  - Inspect external genitalia and scrotum for abnormalities.
  - Palpate scrotal sac on both sides.
  - Attempt to milk the testis from the external ring to the scrotum if not located.

### Management:
- **Urgent Referral**:
  - If suspected disorder of sexual development or bilateral undescended testes at birth: refer to a paediatrician within 24 hours.
  - If bilateral undescended testes at 6–8 weeks: refer to a paediatrician within 2 weeks.
- **Follow-Up for Unilateral Undescended Testis**:
  - Re-examine at 6–8 weeks and 4–5 months. If still undescended, refer to paediatric surgery or urology by 6 months for possible surgery.
- **Retractile Testis**: Advise annual follow-up and re-examination until after puberty due to risk of ascending testis.
- **Self-Examination**: Advise boys and young men with a history of undescended testis to perform regular testicular self-examinations during and after puberty due to increased cancer risk.
- **Support**: Provide parents/carers with information and support resources.
