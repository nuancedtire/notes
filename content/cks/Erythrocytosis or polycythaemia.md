## Polycythaemia/Erythrocytosis Summary

### Definition
- **Erythrocytosis**: Abnormally high hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration.
- **Absolute Erythrocytosis**: Increased total number of red blood cells (increased red-cell mass).

### Classification
1. **Primary Erythrocytosis**: 
   - Caused by polycythaemia vera (neoplastic proliferation of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow).
   - May also present with thrombocytosis and leucocytosis.

2. **Secondary Erythrocytosis**: 
   - Increased red-cell mass due to increased erythropoietin production.
   - Commonly due to chronic tissue hypoxia (e.g., chronic lung disease).
   - Inappropriate erythropoietin production can occur with certain kidney disorders, renal tumors, and hepatomas.

3. **Idiopathic Erythrocytosis**: 
   - Increased red-cell mass with no identifiable cause.

4. **Apparent Erythrocytosis**: 
   - Increased hematocrit and hemoglobin with normal red-cell mass.
   - Caused by low plasma volume (e.g., thiazide diuretics, heavy smoking, heavy alcohol use).

### Complications
- **Increased Blood Viscosity**: Elevated risk of thrombosis and cardiovascular events.
- **Polycythaemia Vera**: Risk of hemorrhage (especially with severe thrombocytosis); potential progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Secondary Erythrocytosis**: Prognosis depends on the underlying cause.

### Diagnosis
- Blood sample required (no tourniquet if possible).
- **Absolute Erythrocytosis**: Hematocrit > 0.56 (women) and > 0.60 (men).
- Investigate trends in increasing hematocrit.

### Differentiating Features
- **Polycythaemia Vera Symptoms**: Generalized pruritus after bathing, splenomegaly, thrombocytosis, neutrophil leucocytosis.
- **Secondary Erythrocytosis Causes**: Chronic lung disease, cyanotic heart disease, chronic renal disorders.
- **Apparent Erythrocytosis Factors**: Presence of relevant signs.

### Confirmatory Tests
- **JAK2 V617F Mutation Testing**: For polycythaemia vera.
- **Erythropoietin Levels**: Usually reduced in polycythaemia vera, often raised in secondary erythrocytosis.

### Management
- **Apparent Erythrocytosis**: Manage underlying cause; remeasure hematocrit after two months.
- **Secondary Erythrocytosis**: Refer to specialist; remeasure hematocrit two months after management.
- **Polycythaemia Vera**: Refer to a hematologist for potential treatment (aspirin, venesection, pharmacological cytoreduction).
- **Cardiovascular Risk Factors**: Manage for all patients with erythrocytosis (hyperlipidemia, smoking, hypertension, diabetes).
