- **Pain Characteristics**:
  - Can occur infrequently (with remission periods lasting years) or multiple times daily.
  
- **Causes**:
  - Over 90% of cases caused by vascular compression of the trigeminal nerve.

  - Depression.
  - Inability to eat, leading to weight loss.

  - Paroxysmal attacks of pain.
  - Trigger factors may precipitate attacks.
  - 'Atypical' or 'mixed' trigeminal neuralgia: persistent discomfort between paroxysms.

- **Treatment**:
  - **First-line medication**: Carbamazepine.
    - Dose should be titrated until pain relief is achieved.
    - Generally, 200 mg three or four times a day is effective.

    - Seek specialist advice or referral to a neurologist or pain management specialist.
  
- **Management Tools**:
  - Daily pain diary can aid in pain management.

- **Medication Management**:
