## Acute [[Cholecystitis]] - Summary

- **Definition**: Inflammation of the gallbladder, often due to complete obstruction by a gallstone in the gallbladder neck or cystic duct.

- **Types**:
  - **Acalculous [[Cholecystitis]]**: Gallbladder inflammation without [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|gallstones]] (5–14% of cases). 
    - Causes: Poorly understood; functional cystic duct obstruction, bile stasis/thickening, dehydration, bacterial colonization.

- **Symptoms**:
  - Sudden-onset, constant, severe pain in the upper right quadrant (lasting hours).
  - Tenderness (with or without guarding) in the right upper quadrant.
  - Other signs: fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, back/shoulder pain, right upper quadrant mass, positive Murphy's sign.

- **Complications (25–30% without treatment)**:
  - Necrosis of gallbladder wall (gangrenous [[cholecystitis]]).
  - Perforation of the gallbladder.
  - Biliary peritonitis.
  - Pericholecystic abscess.
  - Fistula (gallbladder and duodenum).
  - Jaundice (Mirizzi's syndrome).
  - Sepsis.

- **Mortality Rates**:
  - Acalculous [[cholecystitis]]: 10–50% (higher than acute [[cholecystitis]] mortality of 4%).
  - Critically ill patients with perforation or gangrene: 50–60%.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - History and examination for symptoms and signs of acute [[cholecystitis]].
  - Assess for risk factors and exclude differential diagnoses (peptic ulcer disease, liver disease, pancreatitis, cardiac disease).
  - Monitor for complications.

- **Management**:
  - Hospital admission for all suspected cases.
  - Diagnosis confirmation: abdominal ultrasound, blood tests (WBC count, C-reactive protein, serum amylase).
  - Monitoring (blood pressure, pulse, urinary output).
  - Treatment: intravenous fluids, antibiotics, analgesia.
  - Surgical assessment for cholecystectomy.
