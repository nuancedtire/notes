## Rubella Summary

- **Definition**: Rubella (German measles) is a viral infection transmitted via direct contact or respiratory droplets. It is preventable through vaccination.

- **Infection Characteristics**:
  - Most cases are mild and resolve within a week.
  - Serious complications arise from maternal infection in non-immune women during pregnancy, leading to miscarriage, stillbirth, or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS).

- **Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS)**:
  - Severity and type of defects depend on the gestational age at infection.
  - High risk of multiple defects if infection occurs before 8–10 weeks gestation.

- **Current Situation**:
  - Rubella is uncommon in the UK due to childhood immunization programs.
  - CRS cases are very rare.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - No specific clinical features; laboratory confirmation is required.

- **Clinical Features**:
  - **Rash**: Pink/light red, maculopapular, starts on face/neck, spreads, lasts 3–4 days.
  - **Lymphadenopathy**: Commonly suboccipital, postauricular, cervical; may precede rash and last 2 weeks post-rash.
  - **Arthritis/Arthralgia**: More prevalent in adult women.
  - **Non-specific symptoms**: Low-grade fever, headache, malaise, nausea, mild upper respiratory symptoms, non-purulent conjunctivitis.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Incomplete immunization.
  - No evidence of previous infection.
  - Recent exposure to rubella contacts or travel to endemic areas.

- **Pregnancy Considerations**:
  - Low suspicion threshold for rubella in pregnant women with rash.
  - Rubella must be excluded even if other causes are likely.

- **Notifiable Disease**: 
  - Notify local Health Protection Team (HPT) if rubella is suspected for appropriate investigation guidance.

- **Recommendations for Non-Pregnant Individuals**:
  - Rest, hydrate, and take paracetamol/ibuprofen for relief.
  - Stay home for at least 5 days post-rash development and avoid contact with pregnant women.

- **Post-Exposure Advice**:
  - Seek medical advice if symptoms develop after contact with confirmed/suspected rubella.
  - Avoid contact with pregnant women.

- **Pregnant Women**:
  - Urgently refer those with confirmed rubella and ≤20 weeks gestation for risk assessment and counseling.
  - No risk of CRS after 20 weeks.
  - Arrange serology testing for those exposed to possible rubella if immunity criteria are not met, and contact HPT.
