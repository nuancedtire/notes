## Candida - Skin: Summary

- **Overview:**
  - Candida is a yeast-like fungus, part of the human gastrointestinal tract and vaginal flora.
  - Not part of normal skin flora; can transiently colonize fingers or body folds.
  - Usually asymptomatic but can cause infections when mucosal barriers are disrupted or immune defenses are lowered.

- **Infection Types:**
  - Ranges from non-life-threatening superficial mucocutaneous disorders to invasive disseminated disease.
  - **Candida albicans** is the most common species causing infections.

- **Common Infection Sites:**
  - Occurs where skin rubs against skin (e.g., skin folds) and in warm, moist areas leading to maceration and inflammation.

- **Diagnosis:**
  - Typically based on clinical features; investigations usually unnecessary.
  - Exclude underlying causes for widespread or recurrent infections.
  - Hospital admission if systemic candidiasis is suspected (e.g., peritonitis, meningitis).

- **Treatment:**
  - **Non-widespread and not significantly immunocompromised:**
    - Adults: Topical imidazole (e.g., clotrimazole, econazole, miconazole, ketoconazole) or topical terbinafine.
    - Children: Topical clotrimazole, econazole, or miconazole.
    - For inflammation/itch: Mildly potent corticosteroid cream (e.g., hydrocortisone 1%) alongside antifungal for 7 days; review after this period.
      - Significant improvement: Continue for another 7 days.
      - No response: Discontinue treatment and reassess diagnosis.

  - **Widespread infection or significantly immunocompromised:**
    - Ages 16+: Oral fluconazole for 2 weeks; review response.
      - If unresolved, consider further 2 weeks of fluconazole, swabbing, specialist advice, or referral to a dermatologist.
    - Ages <16 or if fluconazole contraindicated: Seek specialist advice.

- **Patient Advice:**
  - Avoid skin occlusion.
  - Wash skin regularly with soap substitute; ensure proper drying.
  - Lose weight if obesity contributes to skin fold rubbing.

- **Referral to Dermatologist:**
  - For widespread or recurrent infections with unidentified causes.
  - If diagnosis is uncertain.
