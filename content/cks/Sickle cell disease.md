## Sickle Cell Disease: Summary

- **Definition**: A group of inherited conditions characterized by sickle haemoglobin (Hb S).
- **Mechanism**: Abnormal beta-globin chain polymerizes when deoxygenated, causing erythrocytes to distort into a sickle shape.
- **Consequences**:
  - Clusters of deformed erythrocytes block blood vessels.
  - Damage to large and small blood vessels.
  - Sequestration in the liver and spleen.
  - Causes:
    - Intense pain (sickle cell crisis)
    - Anaemia
    - Infections
    - Chest problems
    - Other complications
- **Severity**: Can be life-threatening, especially in young children.
  
### Genetics
- **Inheritance**:
  - Gene for Hb S from one parent.
  - Gene for an abnormal haemoglobin variant from the other parent.
- **Types**:
  - **Homozygous Sickle Cell Disease (Hb SS)**: Both genes are for Hb S (sickle cell anaemia); most common and severe form.
  - **Sickle Cell Trait (Hb AS)**: One gene for normal haemoglobin (Hb A) and one for sickle cell haemoglobin; usually asymptomatic but 50% chance of passing on the sickle cell gene.
  
### Epidemiology
- **Prevalence**: Affects 1 in 2000 live births in England.
- **Screening**: Offered to all newborns and pregnant women in the UK.

### Diagnosis
- **Suspected in**:
  - Very young infants with signs of haemolysis or splenic sequestration.
  - Children over 4 months with signs of sickle cell disease (e.g., dactylitis).
  - High-risk ethnic groups (African or African-Caribbean) with acute crisis features or chronic complications.

- **Sickle Cell Crisis Indicators**:
  - Sudden onset of pain, infection, or anaemia.
  - Symptoms like stroke or priapism.
  - History of previous crises.

### Management
- **Follow-up**: Regular monitoring by a multi-disciplinary team with an individual care plan.
- **Primary Healthcare Role**:
  - Ensure understanding and adherence to self-management advice (immunizations, malaria prophylaxis, antibiotic prophylaxis).
  - Identify sickle cell crises and ensure appropriate treatment, including potential admission.
  - Provide support for chronic complications, such as chronic pain.
