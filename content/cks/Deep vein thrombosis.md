## Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Summary

### Definition
- DVT is the formation of a thrombus (blood clot) in a deep vein, typically in the legs, causing partial or complete obstruction of blood flow.

### Incidence
- Annual incidence: 1–2 per 1000 people.

### Risk Factors

#### Continuing or Intrinsic Risk Factors
- History of DVT
- Cancer (known or undiagnosed)
- Age over 60 years
- Being overweight or obese
- Male sex
- Heart failure
- Acquired or familial thrombophilia
- Inflammatory disorders (e.g., vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease)

#### Temporary Risk Factors
- Significant immobility
- Significant trauma (e.g., intravenous catheter insertion)
- Hormone treatment (e.g., hormone replacement therapy)
- Pregnancy and postpartum period
- Dehydration

### Complications
- Most serious complication: pulmonary embolism.

### Signs and Symptoms
- Localized pain and swelling in one leg (occasionally both)
- Tenderness
- Skin changes (oedema, redness, warmth)
- Vein distension

### Differential Diagnosis
- Physical trauma
- Cardiovascular disorders (e.g., superficial thrombophlebitis, post-thrombotic syndrome)
- Other conditions (e.g., ruptured Baker’s cyst, cellulitis, dependent oedema)

### Assessment
- Use the two-level DVT Wells score to assess likelihood of DVT.

### Management

#### Likely DVT
- Offer proximal leg vein ultrasound within 4 hours.
- If ultrasound cannot be done within 4 hours:
  - D-dimer testing
  - Interim therapeutic anticoagulation
  - Ultrasound results within 24 hours

#### Unlikely DVT
- Take blood sample for D-dimer testing with results within 4 hours:
  - If positive: Offer ultrasound within 4 hours (or interim anticoagulation and ultrasound within 24 hours).
  - If negative: Consider alternative diagnosis.
- If D-dimer results delayed beyond 4 hours: Offer interim anticoagulation.

### Treatment
- DVT patients require anticoagulant treatment in secondary care.
- Maintenance treatment with oral anticoagulant for at least 3 months upon discharge (unless contraindications like cancer or pregnancy exist).

### Patient Education
- Instructions on using anticoagulants.
- Duration of treatment and monitoring requirements.
- Possible adverse effects and interactions.
- Effects of anticoagulants on dental treatment.
- Risks associated with extended travel.
