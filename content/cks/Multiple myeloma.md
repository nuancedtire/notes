### Multiple Myeloma: Quick Revision Guide

**Definition:**  
- Progressive malignant disease with abnormal plasma cell proliferation in bone marrow and monoclonal immunoglobulins in blood.  
- Affects bones, kidneys, blood, and immune system.

**Incidence:**  
- Europe: 4.5–6.0 per 100,000 people/year.  
- Second most common hematological malignancy in the UK.  
- More common in men and incidence increases with age.

**Prognosis:**  
- Usually incurable but disease control can be achieved for several years.  
- Worse prognosis with:  
  - High serum beta-2 microglobulin levels  
  - High plasma cell counts  
  - Diffuse bone lesions  
  - Hypercalcaemia  
  - Very high M protein levels in blood/urine  
  - Renal impairment

**Complications:**  
- Pathological bone fractures  
- Spinal cord compression  
- Renal damage  
- Hypercalcaemia  
- Impaired infection resistance  
- Anaemia  
- Bleeding disorders  
- Hyperviscosity of blood

**Symptoms:**  
- Bone pain (often lower back)  
- Fatigue  
- Confusion, muscle weakness, constipation, thirst, polyuria (hypercalcaemia)  
- Weight loss  
- Recurrent infections  
- Headache, visual disturbances, cognitive impairment, mucosal bleeding, breathlessness (hyperviscosity)  
- Sensory loss, paraesthesia, limb weakness, walking difficulty, sphincter disturbance (spinal cord compression)  
- Occasionally asymptomatic with blood test abnormalities:  
  - Normochromic, normocytic anaemia  
  - Renal impairment  
  - Hypercalcaemia  
  - Raised ESR, plasma viscosity, serum protein, or globulin

**Investigations if Suspected:**  
- Full blood count, serum calcium, plasma viscosity/ESR for people >60 with persistent bone pain or unexplained fractures.  
- Urgent serum electrophoresis, serum-free light chain assay, and Bence-Jones protein urine assessment within 48 hours for those >60 with hypercalcaemia or leukopenia.  
- Additional investigations: peripheral blood film, serum urea, creatinine and electrolytes, liver function tests, X-rays for bone pain.

**Urgent Referrals/Admissions:**  
- Urgent hospital admission for symptoms of spinal cord compression or moderate to severe hypercalcaemia (corrected calcium ≥ 3.01 mmol/L) or acute kidney injury.  
- Urgent referral to a haematologist (within 2 weeks) if serum/urine protein electrophoresis suggests myeloma.

**Secondary Care Treatments:**  
- Dependent on age, disease stage, prognosis, and comorbidities:  
  - Bisphosphonates (reduce bone disease/pain)  
  - Treatments for anaemia  
  - Chemotherapeutic drugs  
  - High-dose drug therapy and stem cell transplantation
