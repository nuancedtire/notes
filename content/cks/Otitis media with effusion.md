- **Definition**: Otitis media with effusion (OME), also known as 'glue ear', is the presence of fluid in the middle ear without acute inflammation.
  
- **Prevalence**: Most common cause of hearing impairment in childhood; prevalent in children aged 6 months to 4 years, especially in winter months.

- **Hearing Loss**: 
  - Usually resolves in weeks to months.
  - Persistent bilateral cases may lead to developmental issues.

- **Symptoms**: Vary with time and childâ€™s age.

- **Pathophysiology**: 
  - Complex, involving multiple factors:
    - Genetic factors
    - Endogenous irritants (smoking, pollution, allergy, reflux)
  - Over 50% cases follow acute otitis media, especially in children under 3.

- **Causes of Persistence**:
  - Impaired eustachian tube function.
  - Low-grade infections (viral or bacterial).
  - Local inflammatory reactions.
  - Adenoidal infection/hypertrophy.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Increased incidence in children with:
    - Cleft palate
    - Down syndrome
    - Cystic fibrosis
    - Primary ciliary dyskinesia
    - Allergic rhinitis
  - Environmental factors: low socioeconomic status, parental smoking, frequent upper-respiratory infections.

- **Complications**:
  - Conductive hearing loss.
  - Speech and language development issues.
  - Communication difficulties.
  - Chronic tympanic membrane damage.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Based on suspected hearing loss, clinical history, and physical examination (ears, nose, throat, chest).
  - Requires formal assessment: tympanometry and hearing tests.

- **Referral Criteria**:
  - Child has Down syndrome or cleft palate.
  - Severe hearing loss impacting quality of life.
  - Urgent referral needed for suspected sensorineural hearing loss.
  - Structural abnormalities of tympanic membrane or other alternative diagnosis signs.
  - Persistent foul-smelling discharge suggestive of cholesteatoma (urgent referral within 2 weeks).
