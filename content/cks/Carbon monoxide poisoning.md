## Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: Summary

### Overview
- **Carbon Monoxide (CO)**: Colourless, odourless, tasteless gas from incomplete combustion.
- **Mechanism**: Binds to haemoglobin (240x affinity over oxygen) forming carboxyhaemoglobin, reducing blood's oxygen-carrying capacity.

### Statistics
- Approx. **40 deaths** and **440 hospital admissions** annually in England and Wales.

### Sources of Exposure
- Poorly installed, faulty, or improperly used fuel-burning appliances.
- Retention of engine exhaust gases in enclosed spaces.
- Inhalation of smoke from burning buildings.
- Indoor use of outdoor appliances (e.g., charcoal barbecues).
- Use of shisha/hookah in poorly ventilated rooms.

### Suspected Poisoning Indicators
- Presence of clinical features of poisoning.
- Known exposure to CO sources.
- Symptoms correlate with exposure.

### High-Risk Groups
- Older adults
- Children
- Pregnant women
- Individuals with respiratory/cardiovascular diseases
- People with anaemia

### Symptoms
#### Brief Exposure to Low Levels
- Dizziness
- Flushing
- Headache
- Muscle pain
- Nausea/Vomiting
- Personality changes
- Vertigo

#### Higher Levels Exposure
- Confusion
- Hypotension
- Loss of consciousness
- Death
- Movement problems
- Myocardial infarction
- Respiratory failure
- Weakness

#### Chronic Low-Level Exposure
- Cardiovascular issues
- Dementia
- Dizziness
- Flu-like symptoms
- Headache
- Lethargy
- Vision loss
- Memory issues
- Neuropsychological problems (e.g., anxiety, balance issues)

### Management
- Measure exhaled CO levels via breath test.
- Obtain heparinised venous blood sample.
- Administer 100% oxygen with a tight-fitting mask until asymptomatic:
  - Carboxyhaemoglobin levels ≤ 2% (non-smokers)
  - Carboxyhaemoglobin levels ≤ 10% (smokers)
- Use CO-pulse oximeter if available.
- Conduct neurological examination post-chronic exposure or if neurological signs present.
- Refer to emergency department if primary care management isn't feasible or if at increased risk.
- Provide advice on preventing future exposure.
- Follow up for delayed or persistent symptoms.
