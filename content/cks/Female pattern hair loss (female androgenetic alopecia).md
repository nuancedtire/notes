- **Definition**: Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) or female androgenetic alopecia is genetically determined, progressive hair loss from the scalp.

- **Presentation**:
  - Diffuse reduction in hair density over the crown and frontal scalp.
  - Widening of the central parting.
  - Retention of the frontal hairline.

- **Pathogenesis**: 
  - Role of androgens is unclear; not considered major contributors for most women.
  - Term 'female pattern hair loss' preferred over 'female androgenetic alopecia'.

- **Onset**:
  - Typically before age 40.
  - Over 10% of premenopausal women show evidence of pattern hair loss.
  - Incidence increases around menopause; may affect up to 56% of women over 70.

- **Complications**:
  - Psychosocial effects include impaired self-esteem and feelings of isolation.
  - Hair loss progresses over time, but the rate is unpredictable; complete baldness is rare.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Supported by history taking and physical examination.
  - Consider alternative diagnoses if:
    - Profound shedding or rapid onset of hair loss.
    - Temporal hair thinning.
    - Inflammation, papules, pustules, scaling, or scarring of the scalp.
    - Absent/reduced eyebrows or eyelashes.
    - Systemic disease (e.g., severe infection, iron deficiency, hypothyroidism).
    - Medication changes.
    - Extreme dietary habits.

- **Laboratory Testing**:
  - Generally unnecessary, but consider:
    - Thyroid function tests.
    - Full blood count.
    - Ferritin and vitamin D levels if telogen effluvium is suspected, presentation is atypical, or features of anemia/hypothyroidism are present.
    - Basic endocrine investigations if androgen excess features (hirsutism, irregular periods) are present.

- **Management Options**:
  - No treatment (for mild cases).
  - Drug treatment (topical minoxidil).
  - Aesthetic options (hairpieces, wigs, hair styling, hair coloring).
  - Surgical treatment (hair transplantation).

- **Referral to Specialist**:
  - Consider if:
    - Atypical presentation or extensive hair loss.
    - Clinical/biochemical evidence of androgen excess.
    - No response to primary care treatments.
    - Adverse psychosocial effects.
