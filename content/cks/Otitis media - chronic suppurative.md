## Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) - Quick Revision

### Definition
- **Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM)**: Chronic inflammation of the middle ear and mastoid cavity with recurrent ear discharges (otorrhoea) through a tympanic perforation for at least 2 weeks.

### Background
- Typically a complication of **Acute Otitis Media (AOM)**.
- WHO defines CSOM after **2 weeks** of discharge; some experts suggest **6 weeks** as a cut-off.
- Estimated prevalence in the UK: **<1%**.

### Implications
- Can lead to hearing loss, affecting language development in children.
- Untreated infections may spread:
  - **Extracranially**: facial paralysis, mastoiditis (rare).
  - **Intracranially**: meningitis, cerebral abscess (rare).

### Symptoms Supporting Diagnosis
- Ear discharge for **at least 2 weeks** without pain or fever.
- History of AOM (ear pain, fever, irritability), ear trauma, glue ear, or grommet insertion.
- Painless ear examination revealing tympanic membrane perforation.
- Possible hearing loss.

### Assessment
- Check for:
  - Postauricular swelling (tenderness).
  - Facial paralysis.
  - Vertigo.
  - Signs of intracranial infection (admission needed).
- Inquire about:
  - Hearing loss impact on daily activities and language development.
- Exclude alternative causes for persistent ear discharge:
  - **Otitis externa**: inflamed, eczematous canal without perforation.
  - **Foreign body**: particularly in children.
  - **Impacted ear wax**.
  - **Neoplasm**: ear canal swelling that bleeds on contact.

### Management
- **Admission**: for signs of infection beyond the ear (e.g., postauricular swelling, headache, facial paralysis, vertigo).
- **Referral**: to ENT specialist for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.
- **Caution**: 
  - Do not swab ears.
  - Do not initiate treatment prematurely.
- **Reassurance**: Hearing loss typically resolves with perforation healing; a hearing test may be conducted in secondary care.
