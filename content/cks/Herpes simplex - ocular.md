## Ocular Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Infections: Quick Revision

### Summary of Infections
- **Causes Inflammation**: Retina (retinitis), iris (iritis/uveitis), cornea (keratitis), conjunctiva (conjunctivitis), eyelids (blepharitis), and surrounding skin (periocular dermatitis).
- **Primary Infection**: Usually asymptomatic; symptomatic cases often present as blepharoconjunctivitis.
- **Recurrent Infection**: More common, typically leads to keratitis affecting:
  - **Epithelial**: Most common (50–80%).
  - **Stromal**: Can be non-necrotizing or necrotizing.
  - **Metaherpetic Ulcer**: Trophic keratitis.

### Transmission
- **Primary Type**: HSV type 1 (HSV-1), less frequently HSV type 2 (HSV-2).
- **Transmission Method**: Direct contact with active lesions or infected secretions (saliva, tears) from an active shedder.
- **Latency**: Virus remains latent in trigeminal nerve ganglion, can reactivate.

### Complications
- Corneal scarring & visual impairment.
- Corneal perforation.
- Secondary infections (bacterial or fungal).
- Systemic infections (aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis).

### Prognosis
- **Blepharoconjunctivitis**: Resolves within 2 weeks.
- **Epithelial Keratitis**: Resolves in 1–2 weeks.
- 25% of epithelial keratitis cases develop stromal keratitis or iritis.
- Recurrent infections become more common with each episode.

### Diagnosis in Primary Care
- **Clinical Signs/Symptoms**:
  - Eye pain, irritation, watering, photophobia.
  - Blurred vision.
  - Acute red eye.
  - Vesicles, ulcers, or pustules on eyelids/periocular skin.
  - Hazy cornea or creamy opacity (indicates stromal keratitis).
  - Fixed irregular pupil or limbal injection (indicates iritis/uveitis).
  - Reduced corneal sensation and visual acuity.

- **Assessment**:
  - History of previous episodes and triggers.
  - Check for associated complications and conditions affecting prognosis (immunosuppression, atopy).
  - General examination for systemic infection (pyrexia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly).
  - **Fluorescein Staining**: To check for dendritic or amoeboid ulcers (suggesting epithelial involvement).
  - Visual acuity assessment.

### Management
- **Referral**: All suspected cases should be referred to eye casualty/emergency eye service for same-day assessment and specialist management.
- **Specialist Advice**: If same-day assessment isn't possible, seek ophthalmological advice for initiating treatment in primary care.
- **Topical Antiviral Treatment**: Some optometrists can initiate this for suspected epithelial keratitis in specific situations.
