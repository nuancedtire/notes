- **Types of Constipation**:
  - **Idiopathic (Functional)**: No anatomical or physiological abnormalities identified.

- **Contributing Factors**:
  - Pain
  - Fever
  - Inadequate fluid intake
  - Reduced dietary fiber

- **Management**:
  - **Red Flags**: Urgent referral needed; do not initiate treatment in primary care.
  - **Amber Flags**: Referral based on clinical judgment; treatment can be initiated in primary care.

- **Primary Care Management Steps**:
  - Reassure that underlying causes have been excluded.
  - Advise that idiopathic constipation is treatable with laxatives (may require several months).
  - Provide information and support resources.
  - Treat identified faecal impaction with a disimpaction regimen.
  - Start maintenance laxative treatment if no impaction or after successful treatment.
  - Implement behavioral interventions (scheduled toileting, bowel habit diary, reward systems).
  - Schedule regular follow-ups to assess treatment adherence and response.
  - Consider specialist referral if symptoms do not improve with optimal primary care treatment or if severe distress is present from faecal impaction.
