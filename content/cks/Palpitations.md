## Palpitations Summary

**Definition**: Palpitations are abnormally perceived heartbeats, characterized by sensations of racing, irregularity, or pounding.

**Common Causes**:
- Atrial or ventricular extrasystoles (ectopics)
- Tachycardias (heart rate > 100 bpm)
- [[Atrial fibrillation]] or flutter

**Diagnosis**:
- **Gold standard**: Electrocardiogram (ECG) during an episode.

**Assessment**:
1. Check for serious symptoms:
   - Breathlessness
   - [[Chest pain]]
   - Syncope or near syncope
2. History of:
   - Ischaemic heart disease
   - Heart failure
   - Cardiomyopathy
   - Valve disease
3. Family history of sudden cardiac death (relative < 40 years)
4. Vital signs:
   - Heart rate and rhythm
   - Blood pressure
   - Heart murmurs or lung crepitations
5. Take an ECG immediately.

**If uncertain about VT or SVT**:
- Request immediate expert ECG interpretation.
- Arrange emergency admission with ECG copy.

**Emergency Admission Criteria**:
- Current palpitations with:
  - Ventricular tachycardia
  - Persistent SVT (consider Valsalva manoeuvre or carotid sinus massage)
  - Symptoms of breathlessness, [[chest pain]], syncope
  - Hypotension

**Management of Palpitations**:
- If due to arrhythmias (e.g., sinus tachycardia, [[atrial fibrillation]]/flutter):
  - Assess for underlying cause
  - Initiate management
  - Arrange cardiology referral if appropriate
- Normal ECG with no underlying disease: reassurance.
- Referral needed for patients with:
  - Symptoms suggestive of VT or SVT
  - Serious symptoms or complications
  - Risk factors for serious arrhythmias
  - Major ECG abnormalities

**If cause is unclear**:
- Arrange ambulatory monitoring for symptomatic episodes.
- Order echocardiogram if heart murmur or heart failure suspected.
- Referral may be necessary for recurrent palpitations with no identified cause.
