- **Definition**: Superficial corneal injuries are non-penetrating injuries to the outermost layer of the cornea. 
- **Corneal Abrasions**: Defects in the corneal epithelial surface, typically heal within 1–2 days.

### Clinical Presentation
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Sudden onset pain
  - Discomfort or foreign body sensation
  - Tearing

### Mechanism of Injury
- Determine the mechanism and materials involved:
  - Chemical injuries
  - High-velocity foreign bodies
  - Sharp objects
- **Precipitating Events**:
  - Object striking the eye
  - Foreign body entering the eye
  - Difficult contact lens removal

### Red Flags
- Exclude serious causes of red eye if:
  - Significant changes in vision
  - Significant trauma
  - Marked eye pain, headache, or photophobia

### Eye Examination
- **Goals**:
  - Exclude penetrating or perforating injuries
  - Check visual acuity
  - Identify foreign bodies (evert upper eyelid to check for subtarsal foreign bodies)
  - Identify corneal abrasions (use fluorescein for staining; abrasions fluoresce bright green with a cobalt-blue filter)

### Immediate Referral Criteria
- **Refer to emergency eye service for**:
  - Suspected penetrating eye injury or intraocular foreign body
  - High-velocity injuries (e.g., hammering, chiselling, grinding, lawn mowing)
  - Sharp object injuries (e.g., glass, knives, thorns)
  - Chemical injuries (irrigate affected eye for 20–30 minutes, urgent assessment)
  - Non-removable foreign body or inability to tolerate examination

### Other Referral Indications
- Red flag symptoms/signs (e.g., severe pain, pupillary abnormalities, significant visual acuity reduction)
- Hyphema (blood in anterior chamber) or hypopyon (inflammatory exudate)
- Large or deep abrasions
- Corneal opacities

### Discussion with Ophthalmology
- Consider urgency for:
  - Superficial corneal injury from contact lens use
  - Recurrent erosion syndrome
  - Persistent/worsening symptoms after 24 hours
  - Rust rings post-removal of metallic foreign body

### Management
- **Primary Care**:
  - Remove loose superficial foreign bodies if expertise/equipment available
  - Offer analgesia and ocular lubricants for pain relief
  - Consider topical antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol) to prevent secondary infection
- **Advice**:
  - Eye protection to prevent future injuries
  - Avoid rubbing/touching eye and using contact lenses until recovery

### Follow-Up
- Arrange follow-up in 24 hours to check healing of the abrasion
- Advise urgent medical review if symptoms worsen or new features develop in the interim.
