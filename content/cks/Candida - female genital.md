## Candida - Female Genital: Summary

### Overview
- **Condition**: Vulvovaginal candidiasis (genital thrush)
- **Caused by**: Superficial fungal infection, usually **Candida albicans**
- **Symptoms**:
  - Vulval/vaginal itch and irritation
  - Non-offensive vaginal discharge
  - Superficial dyspareunia (pain during intercourse)
  - Dysuria (painful urination)

### Types of Infection
- **Acute Infection**: First or single isolated presentation
- **Recurrent Infection**: Four or more symptomatic episodes in one year

### Prevalence
- Up to **20%** of reproductive-age women may be asymptomatically colonized with Candida species (no treatment required).

### Diagnosis
- **Self-diagnosis**: Unreliable; frequent over-diagnosis.
- **Risk Factors**: 
  - Recent antibiotic use
  - Local irritants
  - Uncontrolled diabetes or immunosuppression
  - Increases in estrogen (e.g., pregnancy, combined oral contraceptive pill)

### Possible Complications
- Recurrent infections
- Reduced quality of life
- Psychosexual difficulties

### Assessment
1. **Symptom Inquiry**:
   - Duration, frequency, severity of symptoms.
   - Risk factors for candidiasis/STIs.
   - Previous treatments.
   - Pregnancy risk and contraceptive use.
   
2. **Physical Examination**:
   - External genitalia for inflammation, erythema, fissuring, or excoriations.
   
3. **Laboratory Testing**:
   - High vaginal swab (HVS) for culture if diagnostic uncertainty or persistent symptoms.
   - HVS with full speciation and sensitivity testing for poor/partial response to treatment.

4. **Consider Additional Tests**: Based on clinical judgement.

### Management
- **Advice**:
  - Sources of information and support.
  - Self-management measures for symptom relief.
  
- **Underlying Conditions**: Optimize management of any underlying conditions/risk factors.
  
- **Antifungal Treatment Options**:
  - Oral azoles or topical imidazoles based on:
    - Woman's age
    - Co-morbidities
    - Personal preference
    - Drug cautions/contraindications

- **Follow-Up**: 
  - If treatment fails or recurrent infection is suspected.
  
- **Induction and Maintenance Treatment**: For recurrent infections.
  
- **Specialist Referral**: If:
  - Diagnostic uncertainty
  - Persistent symptoms
  - Affected young individuals
  - Non-albicans Candida or azole-resistant Candida identified.
