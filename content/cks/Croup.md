  - Fever

### Clinical Features
- Result from:
  - Inflammation
  - Swelling of upper airway structures (larynx, vocal cords, trachea)
  - Oedema leading to narrowing of the subglottic region.

### Symptom Classification
1. **Mild**:
   - Barking cough
   - No stridor or sternal/intercostal recession at rest
2. **Moderate**:
   - Barking cough with stridor
   - Sternal recession at rest
   - No (or little) agitation/lethargy
3. **Severe**:
   - Barking cough with stridor
   - Sternal/intercostal recession
   - Associated agitation or lethargy
4. **Impending Respiratory Failure**:
   - Increasing upper airway obstruction
   - Sternal/intercostal recession
   - Asynchronous chest wall/abdominal movement
   - Fatigue, pallor, cyanosis
   - Decreased consciousness or tachycardia

### Management
- **Mild Croup**:
  - Usually managed at home
  - Symptoms typically resolve within 48 hours (up to one week possible)
  - Administer paracetamol or ibuprofen for fever/pain
  - Seek urgent medical advice if deterioration occurs

- **When to Seek Medical Attention**:
  - Chronic lung disease
  - Congenital heart disease
  - Immunodeficiency
  - Respiratory rate >60 breaths/min
  - High fever
  - Inadequate fluid intake

- **Hospital Admission**: Required for moderate/severe croup or impending respiratory failure.

### Treatment
- **All Children with Croup** (mild, moderate, severe):
  - Single dose of oral dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg body weight)
  
- **Alternatives if Oral Treatment Not Possible**:
  - Inhaled budesonide (2 mg nebulized as a single dose)
  - Intramuscular dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg as a single dose)
