### Healthcare-associated Infections: Summary

- **Definition**: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) develop as a direct result of healthcare interventions or direct contact with a healthcare setting.

- **Causes**: 
  - Caused by various microorganisms, including:
    - Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
    - Meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)
    - Clostridium difficile (C. difficile)
    - Escherichia coli (E. coli)

- **Statistics**:
  - Approximately 300,000 cases of HAIs occur annually in England due to NHS care.
  
- **Common Types of HAIs**:
  - Respiratory infections (22.8%)
  - Urinary tract infections (17.2%)
  - Surgical site infections (15.7%)
  
- **Transmission**:
  - Via blood, body fluids, or excretions.
  - Contact with non-intact skin or contaminated equipment.
  - Inhalation of droplets or airborne pathogens.
  - Inoculation incidents.

- **Impact**:
  - Can exacerbate existing conditions, delay recovery, and affect quality of life.

- **Standard Infection Control Precautions**:
  - Assessment of risk to/from individuals.
  - Hand hygiene measures.
  - Appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE).
  - Respiratory and cough hygiene.
  - Safe management of equipment.
  - Maintenance of environmental cleanliness.
  - Safe management of laundry and spillages.
  - Safe disposal of waste and sharps.

- **Education and Training**:
  - Care providers should be educated on infection prevention principles.
  - Training in hand decontamination, use of PPE, and safe disposal of sharps.

- **Precautions for Invasive Devices**:
  - Ensure sterilization of equipment and check packaging integrity and expiry date.
  - Perform skin decontamination before device insertion (e.g., using 2% Chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol).
  - Maintain a ‘closed’ system with minimal connections.
  - Apply standard precautions and aseptic techniques during manipulation.

- **Additional Precautions for Known/Suspected Infectious Agents**:
  - Schedule procedures at the end of sessions for cleaning.
  - Wear disposable gloves and aprons when in contact with body fluids; dispose of after each use.
  - Use long-sleeved fluid-repellent gowns if risk of splashing exists.
  - Clean treatment areas with detergent and disinfectant after use.
  - Dispose of body fluid-contaminated waste as infectious waste.
