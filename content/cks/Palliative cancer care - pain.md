## Palliative Cancer Care - Pain: Summary

### Pain Types
- **Cancer-related pain**: Persistent or breakthrough (episodic)
  - Influenced by physical, psychological, social, and spiritual factors.
  - **Breakthrough pain**:
    - Unpredictable (spontaneous)
    - Predictable (incident) related to movement or activity.
  
### Pain Classification
- **Types of Pain**:
  - Somatic
  - Visceral
  - Neuropathic
- **Causes**:
  - Direct effects of a tumor
  - Cancer treatment
  - Procedures (e.g., dressing changes)
  - Unrelated conditions

### Pain Assessment
- Use a validated structured pain assessment tool.
- Discuss the impact on quality of life.
- Perform an examination:
  - Look for tenderness points.
  - Check for neurological deficits (e.g., spinal cord compression).
- Investigate if a reversible condition could be causing pain or clinical deterioration.

### Pain Management
- Consider:
  - Treatable underlying causes
  - Patient's circumstances, wishes, comorbidities, and existing analgesia
- Management strategies:
  - Prefer oral route when possible.
  - Prescribe regular analgesia for continuous pain, plus as-required analgesia.
  - Use the World Health Organization analgesic ladder (stepwise approach).
  - For incident pain, advise breakthrough analgesia 20â€“30 minutes before anticipated movement.
  - Regularly review and adjust analgesia as necessary.
  
#### Non-Opioid Adjuvant Drugs
- Consider at any stage:
  - Tricyclic antidepressant or anticonvulsant for neuropathic pain.
  - Antispasmodic for intestinal colic.
  - Muscle relaxant for muscle spasm.
  - Dexamethasone trial for raised intracranial pressure.

#### Strong Opioid Considerations
- If prescribing strong oral opioids:
  - Provide an anti-emetic to prevent nausea.
  - Provide a laxative to prevent constipation.
- If oral route is inappropriate, consider subcutaneous morphine infusion.

### When to Seek Specialist Advice
- Uncertainty in pain management.
- Pain remains uncontrolled (50% or more of starting level after 2 weeks).
- Uncontrolled adverse effects.
- Suspected spinal cord compression or spinal metastases (immediate specialist advice needed).
- Considering an unfamiliar opioid or route of administration.
