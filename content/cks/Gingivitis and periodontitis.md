## Gingivitis and Periodontitis Summary

### Definitions
- **Gingivitis**: Inflammation of the gums.
- **Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (ANUG)**: 
  - Acute, atypical bacterial infection
  - Symptoms: Painful gums with ulceration, necrosis of dental papillae, bleeding
- **Periodontitis**: 
  - Chronic inflammation of supporting tissues around teeth
  - Results in largely irreversible tissue damage

### Risk Factors
- Ineffective oral hygiene
- Cigarette smoking
- Diabetes mellitus
- Local factors:
  - Calculus
  - Tooth position
  - Overhanging restorations
  - Partial dentures

### Progression
- **Plaque-associated gingivitis** may progress to **periodontitis** if plaque is not removed.
- Untreated **periodontitis** can lead to:
  - Damage to periodontal attachment and alveolar bone
  - Recurrent gum abscesses
  - Gum detachment from teeth (periodontal pockets)
  - Loss of multiple teeth

### Symptoms
#### Gingivitis
- Rare discomfort
- Features:
  - Reddening and swelling of gum margins
  - Bleeding during brushing, flossing, or probing

#### Periodontitis
- Symptoms often absent, but may include:
  - Halitosis
  - Foul taste in mouth
  - Gum recession and root sensitivity
  - Teeth drifting/loosening, causing eating difficulty
  - Periodontal abscess (may cause pain)

#### Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis
- Symptoms:
  - Intense pain and bleeding gums
  - Severe halitosis
  - Anorexia
  - Malaise or fever (up to 39Â°C)
  - 'Punched-out' ulcers with white/yellowish/grey pseudomembrane on gums

### Management
- Exclude serious underlying diagnoses
- Advise dental treatment:
  - Professional scaling and polishing
  - Root surface instrumentation to remove plaque
- Recommend good oral hygiene
- Provide smoking cessation advice if appropriate

### Referral
- People with ANUG should be referred to a dentist for urgent assessment and management.
