## Influenza - Seasonal: Key Points

### Overview
- **Definition**: Acute respiratory illness caused by RNA viruses from the Orthomyxoviridae family.
- **Types of Influenza Virus**:
  - **Influenza A**: Most frequent, virulent; causes outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.
  - **Influenza B**: Co-circulates with A; generally less severe but can cause outbreaks.
  - **Influenza C**: Causes mild or asymptomatic infections, similar to the common cold.

### Seasonality
- **Occurrence**: Typically in the UK during winter months (December to March).

### Complications
- **Common Respiratory Complications**:
  - Acute bronchitis
  - Pneumonia
  - Exacerbation of asthma and COPD
  - Otitis media
  - Sinusitis

### Symptoms
- **Onset**: Symptoms appear around 2 days post-exposure.
- **Uncomplicated Symptoms**:
  - Coryza
  - Nasal discharge
  - Cough
  - Fever
  - Gastrointestinal symptoms
  - Headache
  - Malaise
  - Myalgia
  - Arthralgia
  - Ocular symptoms
  - Sore throat
- **Complicated Influenza**: Requires hospital admission, involves lower respiratory tract or CNS, or exacerbates an underlying condition.

### Treatment Recommendations
- **For Generally Healthy Individuals**: Antivirals (oseltamivir, zanamivir) not typically recommended unless at risk of complications.
  - **If at risk**: 
    - Treatment should start within 48 hours of symptom onset (36 hours for zanamivir in children).
- **At Risk Groups**:
  - Chronic respiratory, heart, kidney, liver, or neurological diseases
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Obesity or immunosuppression
  - Age over 65 years
  - Pregnant women (up to 2 weeks postpartum)
  - Children under 6 months

### Self-Care for Influenza
- Hydrate adequately
- Use paracetamol or ibuprofen for symptom relief
- Rest
- Stay off work/school until recovery (about 1 week)

### Post-Exposure Prophylaxis
- **Start if**:
  - National surveillance indicates circulating influenza.
  - Close contact with a symptomatic person.
  - The individual is in an 'at risk' group and not effectively immunized.
  - Treatment can begin within 48 hours (36 hours for zanamivir).

### Hospital Admission Criteria
- Consider urgent admission if:
  - Complications (e.g., pneumonia) occur.
  - Concomitant diseases may be affected (e.g., type 1 diabetes).
  - Suspicion of serious illness other than influenza (e.g., meningitis).
