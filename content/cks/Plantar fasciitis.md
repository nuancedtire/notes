## Plantar Fasciitis: Quick Revision Notes

### Overview
- **Condition**: Persistent pain due to degeneration of the plantar fascia from repetitive microtears.
- **Common Age Group**: 40–60 years.
- **Prevalence**: 
  - General population: 4–7%
  - Older population: 7%
  - Regular runners: 8–10%
- **Treatment Requirement**: 11–15% of all foot complaints.

### Diagnosis
- **Method**: Primarily through patient history and physical examination.

### Characteristic Symptoms
- Initial, insidious onset of pain.
- Intense pain with first steps after waking or inactivity.
- Pain reduces with moderate activity but worsens later in the day or after prolonged standing/walking.

### Signs
- Tenderness on palpation of the plantar heel (often at the medial calcaneal tuberosity).
- Limited ankle dorsiflexion (knee in extension).
- Positive 'Windlass test' (pain upon extending the first metatarsophalangeal joint).
- Tight Achilles tendon.
- Antalgic gait or limping.

### Differential Diagnoses
- Achilles tendonitis
- Calcaneal stress fractures
- Fat pad atrophy
- Sub-calcaneal bursitis
- Less common causes: nerve entrapment, peripheral neuropathy, plantar fibromatosis, plantar fascia rupture.
- Neoplasm and vascular insufficiency (rare).

### Management
1. **Reassurance**: Most recover completely within 1 year.
2. **Conservative Measures**:
   - Resting the foot.
   - Supportive footwear.
   - Avoiding barefoot walking.
   - Trial of insoles and heel pads.
   - Weight loss (if applicable).
   - Regular stretching exercises.
3. **Symptom Relief**:
   - Oral analgesics.
   - Ice pack application.
4. **Referral**:
   - Podiatrist or physiotherapist for severe or persistent symptoms.
5. **Corticosteroid Injection**:
   - Short-term relief, preferably ultrasound guided.
6. **Surgical Referral**:
   - If pain persists after conservative treatment.
