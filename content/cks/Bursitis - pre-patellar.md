## Pre-patellar Bursitis: Summary

### Definition
- **Pre-patellar bursa**: Fluid-filled sac between the patella and skin, reducing friction during movement.

### Classification of Bursitis
- **Non-septic**: Sterile inflammation due to:
  - Trauma
  - Overuse
  - Gout
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
- **Septic**: Inflammation due to an infectious organism (usually bacterial).

### Risk Factors
- More common in:
  - Men aged 40â€“60 years
  - Individuals with occupations involving prolonged kneeling or leaning
  - Athletes engaging in repetitive knee movements or direct impact sports

### Complications
- Most cases resolve without issues.
- Septic bursitis poses significant risks:
  - Septic arthritis
  - Necrosis
  - Sepsis
  - Osteomyelitis

### Signs and Symptoms
- Localized swelling over the patella (may be tender, red, or warm).
- Fluctuance (movable and compressible swelling).
- Possible loss of palpability of the patella due to fluid accumulation.
- Normal joint movement range (depending on fluid size).
- Maximal discomfort at extreme knee flexion.
- History of trauma or bursal disease.

### Management
- **Non-septic bursitis**:
  - Conservative treatment: rest, ice, activity modification, simple analgesia.
  - Consider aspiration if effusion is large.
  - Corticosteroid injection consideration.
  
- **Septic bursitis**:
  - Aspiration and antibiotic treatment.
  - Conservative treatment.

- If due to overuse, advise activity modification to prevent recurrence.
- Optimize management of associated conditions (e.g., gout, rheumatoid arthritis).

### Admission and Referral Criteria
- **Urgent Admission**:
  - Suspected septic joint (limited knee movement).
  - Septic bursitis with severe infection/systemic toxicity.

- **Same-day Admission**:
  - Septic bursitis with extensive cellulitis.
  - Need for incision and drainage without available expertise.

- **Hospital Admission Consideration**:
  - Immunocompromised individuals.
  - Comorbid conditions (e.g., diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis).

- **Urgent Referral**:
  - No or inadequate response to antibiotics for septic bursitis.
  
- **Referral Consideration**:
  - Need for aspiration without available expertise.
  - Non-septic bursitis not improving after 2 months of conservative treatment (or sooner if symptoms are severe).
