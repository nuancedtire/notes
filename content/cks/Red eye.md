- **Red Eye Overview**: 
  - Wide differential diagnosis for red eye.
  - Important to determine need for same-day ophthalmologist assessment, urgent assessment, or safe management in primary care.

- **Serious Causes of Red Eye**:
  - Acute glaucoma
  - Anterior uveitis
  - Corneal ulcer
  - Contact lens-related red eye
  - Corneal foreign body
  - Neonatal conjunctivitis
  - Trauma (penetrating eye injury, high-velocity foreign body)
  - Chemical injuries
  - Scleritis
  - Endophthalmitis

- **Assessment of Red Eye**:
  - **History**:
    - Onset and duration of symptoms
    - Unilateral or bilateral presentation
    - Associated symptoms: visual changes, pain, foreign body sensation, discharge, photophobia
    - Contact lens usage
    - Trauma or chemical exposure
    - Previous episodes
    - Relevant past medical history and medication
  - **Examination**:
    - Inspection
    - Visual acuity assessment
    - Fluorescein examination
    - Pupil reactions

- **Indicators for Same-Day Ophthalmology Assessment**:
  - Reduced visual acuity
  - Moderate to severe pain
  - Headache
  - Photophobia
  - Ciliary injection
  - Fluorescein staining of the cornea
  - Unequal/misshapen pupils, abnormal pupillary reactions, painful pupillary constriction
  - Pain on pupillary constriction
  - Loss of red reflex
  - Corneal defect/haze
  - Hyphaema (blood in anterior chamber) or hypopyon (pus in anterior chamber)
  - High-velocity injury
  - Foreign body or penetrating lesion
  - Chemical eye injury
  - Conjunctivitis in infants (first 28 days of life)
