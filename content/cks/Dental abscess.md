### Dental Abscess Summary

- **Definition**: A dental abscess is a localized collection of pus in the teeth, supporting structures, or gums.

- **Types**:
  - **Periapical Abscess** (Dentoalveolar Abscess): 
    - Originates in the dental pulp (center of the tooth).
    - Most common type in adults and children.
  - **Periodontal Abscess**: 
    - Originates in the supporting structures (e.g., periodontal ligament) between the tooth and gum.

- **Causes**:
  - Result of bacterial infection affecting tooth structures.
  - **Periapical abscess**: Usually secondary to dental decay (caries).
  - **Periodontal abscess**: Associated with chronic periodontitis.

- **Prevalence**: Lifetime prevalence ranges from 5% to 46%.

- **Symptoms**:
  - Sudden onset pain (worsening over hours/days).
  - Unpleasant taste in the mouth.
  - Fever and malaise.
  - Trismus (inability to open mouth) or dysphagia.

- **Signs**:
  - Facial swelling.
  - Regional lymphadenopathy.
  - Elevated or decayed tooth with increased mobility and tenderness.
  - Gum swelling with tenderness, warmth, and purulent exudate.

- **Differential Diagnoses**:
  - Infections (e.g., mumps, sinusitis, acute otitis media, facial cellulitis).
  - Salivary gland issues.
  - Neoplasm.
  - Unerupted teeth.

- **Treatment**:
  - **Definitive Treatment**: Provided by a dentist.
  - **Interim Treatment**:
    - Self-care advice to reduce pressure and pain.
    - Analgesics (ibuprofen or paracetamol).
    - **Antibiotics**: 
      - Generally not indicated for healthy individuals at low risk of complications without spreading infection.
      - Prescribed for:
        - Systemically unwell individuals or those with severe infection signs.
        - High-risk individuals (e.g., immunocompromised, diabetic).

- **Emergency Admission**: Required if:
  - Signs of airway compromise.
  - Unwell with high temperature and cardio-respiratory compromise.
  - Significant mandibular, submandibular, or infraorbital swelling.
  - 'Floor of mouth' swelling.
  - Spreading facial infection or orbital cellulitis.
  - Neurological signs (e.g., decreased consciousness, headache).
  - Dehydration.

- **Clinical Judgment**: Consider admission or specialist advice for:
  - Signs/symptoms of systemic infection (nausea, malaise, pyrexia, rigors).
  - Immunocompromised individuals.
  - Very young or elderly patients.
  - Severe pain despite prescribed analgesia.
