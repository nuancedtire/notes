## Child Maltreatment: Recognition and Management Summary

### Definition
Child maltreatment encompasses any abuse or neglect of a child/young person, resulting from either inflicting harm or failing to prevent harm. It includes:

- **Physical Abuse**: Inflicting physical harm (e.g., shaking, hitting, burning).
- **Sexual Abuse**: Forcing or enticing a child into sexual activities.
- **Emotional Abuse**: Conveying feelings of worthlessness or being unloved.
- **Neglect**: Failing to meet basic physical or psychological needs.
- **Fabricated or Induced Illness**: Caregivers misrepresenting the child as ill by fabricating or inducing symptoms.

### Clinical Features (Alerting Signs)
- Frequent or unusual healthcare visits due to injuries indicative of maltreatment.
- Significant, unexpected changes in behavior or emotional state not explained by other conditions.
- Parent/carer refusal for the child to speak privately with healthcare professionals.
- Evidence of sexual activity (e.g., STIs, pregnancy in minors).
- Harmful interactions between parent/carer and child.
- Inadequately explained poor school attendance.
- Evidence of neglect (e.g., missed hospital appointments, medication non-compliance).

### Recommendations
- Seek advice from a child safeguarding professional if uncertain about potential maltreatment.
- Obtain consent before sharing confidential information unless it risks the child's safety.
- Contact children's social care for suspected maltreatment to discuss referral needs.
- Refer to children's social care and/or police if the child is in immediate danger.
- Notify the admitting paediatrician of any safeguarding concerns upon hospital admission.
- If maltreatment is suspected, gather information from other agencies and colleagues.
- If suspicion is confirmed, contact children's social care for a referral.
- If referral is deemed unjustified, ensure regular reviews of the child.
- Document the outcomes in cases where maltreatment is considered.
