## Bronchiectasis Summary

### Definition
- **Bronchiectasis**: A chronic, debilitating disease characterized by permanent dilation of the bronchi due to irreversible damage to the bronchial wall's elastic and muscular components.

### Causes
- Result of inflammatory damage to the airways.
- Associated with various underlying diseases.

### Prevalence
- Affects approximately **5 in every 1000 adults** in the UK.
- More common in **women** than in **men**.

### Clinical Features
- Daily expectoration of large volumes of **purulent sputum**.
- **Cough**.
- **Breathlessness**.
- **Haemoptysis** (coughing up blood).
- **[[Chest pain]]** (non-pleuritic, present between exacerbations).
- **Coarse crackles** during early inspiration.
- **Wheeze** and high-pitched inspiratory **squeaks**.
- **Large airway rhonchi** (low-pitched snore-like sound).
- Palpable **chest secretions** on coughing.

### Suspected Cases in Adults
- Persistent mucopurulent or purulent sputum production with risk factors.
- Cough persisting longer than **8 weeks** with sputum or relevant triggers.
- History of **rheumatoid arthritis** with chronic productive cough or recurrent infections.
- COPD with frequent exacerbations or positive sputum culture for **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**.
- **Inflammatory bowel disease** with chronic productive cough.
- COPD in non-smokers with frequent/prolonged exacerbations.

### Suspected Cases in Children
- Chronic moist/productive cough unresponsive to 4 weeks of antibiotics, especially if positive for:
  - **Staphylococcus aureus**
  - **Haemophilus influenza**
  - **Pseudomonas aeruginosa**
  - Non-tuberculosis mycobacteria
  - **Burkholderia cepacia** complex
- Recurrent/persistent wet cough (over **6 weeks**).
- Asthma unresponsive to treatment.
- Severe pneumonia with unresolved symptoms.
- Recurrent pneumonia and unexplained physical signs or chest radiographic abnormalities.
- Localized chronic bronchial obstruction.
- Respiratory symptoms with structural or functional disorders of the esophagus and upper respiratory tract.
- Unexplained haemoptysis and exertional breathlessness.

### Investigations
- Full medical history.
- **Sputum culture**.
- **Chest X-ray**.
- **Spirometry**.
- **Oxygen saturation level**.
- **Full blood count** (including differential white cell count).

### Referral
- All suspected cases should be referred to a **respiratory physician** for diagnosis confirmation and underlying cause determination.

### Management of Exacerbations
- Infective exacerbations can be managed in **primary care**; hospitalization may be required in some cases.
- Antibiotic choice guided by previous microbiology cultures when available.
- If no previous cultures are available:
  - **First line**: Amoxicillin.
  - Alternatives for penicillin allergy: **Clarithromycin**, **Erythromycin**, or **Doxycycline** (for adults only).
