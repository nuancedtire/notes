## Lyme Disease Summary

- **Cause**: Infection by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria, transmitted through infected tick bites.

- **Incidence**: Estimated 2,000â€“3,000 confirmed cases annually in England and Wales; actual figures may be 2-3 times higher.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Occupational and recreational exposure to wooded areas and fields (especially in high-incidence regions).
  - Increased duration of tick attachment.

- **Complications**:
  - Severe neurological symptoms.
  - Acrodermatitis chronica atrophans.
  - Lyme arthritis.
  - Persistent non-specific symptoms (post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome).

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Erythema migrans rash indicates Lyme disease.
  - Patients with erythema migrans and no focal symptoms: prescribe oral antibiotics.
  - Patients with focal symptoms: refer to specialist, but do not delay treatment.
  - If no erythema migrans but Lyme disease suspected: offer ELISA test.
    - **ELISA Test Results**:
      - **Positive or Equivocal**: Perform immunoblot test; consider starting antibiotics if clinical suspicion is high.
      - **Negative**: Review history/symptoms; consider alternative diagnosis.
        - If still suspected within 4 weeks of symptom onset: repeat ELISA after 4-6 weeks.
        - If symptoms persist for 12 weeks or more: perform immunoblot test.
          - **Immunoblot Test Results**:
            - **Positive**: Diagnose Lyme disease; start oral antibiotics.
            - **Negative but symptoms persist**: Discuss or refer to specialist.
            - **Negative and symptoms resolved**: No treatment required.
