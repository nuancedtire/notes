## Hirsutism Summary

- **Definition**: Excess terminal hair growth in androgen-dependent areas in women (e.g., face, chest, abdomen, lower back, upper arms, thighs).
  
- **Causes**:
  - Increased androgens affecting the pilosebaceous unit.
  - Increased sensitivity of pilosebaceous units to androgens.
  - Peripheral metabolism of androgens.
  
- **Common Cause**: 
  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) - responsible for >70% of cases.
  
- **Other Causes**:
  - Androgen-secreting tumors
  - Adrenal hyperplasia
  - Cushingâ€™s syndrome
  - Acromegaly
  - Hyperprolactinaemia
  - Thyroid disorders
  - Some medications

- **Menopause Effect**:
  - Reduction in estrogen and progesterone can lead to hair and skin disorders.
  - Decreased progesterone may enhance androgen influence on sebaceous glands and hair follicles.

- **Investigation Guidelines**:
  - **Normal Hirsutism Score**: No investigations unless hair growth progresses despite treatment.
  - **Abnormal Hirsutism Score**: Test serum total testosterone. 
    - Referral to endocrinology if testosterone > 4 nmol/L.
  
- **Management Options**:
  - **Premenopausal Women**:
    - Weight loss (if overweight/obese).
    - Hair reduction/removal (shaving, waxing, electrolysis, laser).
    - Eflornithine cream (for facial hirsutism, >19 years).
    - Combined oral contraceptive (if no contraindications).
  
  - **Postmenopausal Women**:
    - Cosmetic hair reduction/removal.
    - Eflornithine cream (for facial hirsutism).
    - Weight loss (if overweight/obese).
  
- **Referral Criteria**:
  - Clinical signs of adrenal or ovarian neoplasm (urgent referral).
  - Suspected underlying endocrine condition requiring secondary care.
  - Ineffective treatment after 6 months.

- **Specialist Treatments**:
  - Anti-androgens (e.g., cyproterone acetate, finasteride, spironolactone, flutamide).
  - Insulin-sensitizing drugs.
  - Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues.
