- **Vitamin D Overview**
  - Fat-soluble vitamin regulating calcium and phosphate homeostasis, vital for musculoskeletal health.
  - Circulates as:
    - Vitamin D3 (colecalciferol)
    - Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)
  - In the UK:
    - 80–90% from sun exposure (UVB radiation)
    - 10–20% from dietary sources.

- **Recommended Vitamin D Thresholds (UK)**
  - Increased risk of deficiency: Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) < 25 nmol/L.
  - Inadequate/insufficient: 25(OH)D 25–50 nmol/L.
  - Sufficient: 25(OH)D > 50 nmol/L.

- **Risk Factors for Vitamin D Deficiency in Children**
  - Low/no sun exposure.
  - Darker skin pigmentation.
  - Exclusively breastfed from birth.
  - Infants >6 months consuming <500 mL formula/day.
  - Malabsorption disorders, severe liver/end-stage chronic kidney disease.
  - Certain medications.
  - Pregnant or breastfeeding.
  - Obesity.

- **Complications of Vitamin D Deficiency**
  - **Rickets**: Leg deformity, painful wrist/costochondral swelling, craniotabes, impaired growth.
  - **Osteomalacia**: Bone/muscle pain, weakness, waddling gait.
  - **Hypocalcaemia**: Irritability, tetany, seizures.

- **Assessment for Vitamin D Deficiency**
  - Check serum 25(OH)D if:
    - Musculoskeletal symptoms (suspected rickets/osteomalacia).
    - Abnormal serum bone profile/X-ray findings.
    - Suspected bone disease (osteomalacia).
    - Known bone disease (osteoporosis) requiring vitamin D correction.

- **Management of Vitamin D Deficiency**
  - Seek specialist advice/referral for:
    - Rickets/hypocalcaemia.
    - Conditions predisposing to hypercalcaemia.
    - Malabsorption disorders.
    - Renal stone disease.
    - Severe kidney/liver disease.
    - Pregnancy.
  - Provide support and information.
  - Advise on safe sunlight exposure and dietary sources.
  - Prescribe:
    - Fixed loading dose followed by maintenance for deficiency.
    - Maintenance dose for insufficiency.
  - Assess dietary calcium intake and supplementation needs.
  - Arrange follow-up to reassess serum vitamin D levels and bone profile.

- **Prevention of Vitamin D Deficiency**
  - Information on safe sunlight exposure and dietary sources.
  - Vitamin D supplement drops for children (birth to 4 years).
  - Consider supplements for other children, especially those at high risk.
