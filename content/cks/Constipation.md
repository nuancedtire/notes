## Constipation Overview

### Definition
- Constipation is a symptom-based disorder characterized by:
  - Infrequent stools
  - Difficulty passing stools
  - Sensation of incomplete emptying
- **Rome IV Criteria**: Spontaneous bowel movements < 3 times/week
- **Chronic Constipation**: Symptoms present for at least 3 months
- **Fecal Loading/Impaction**: Significant retention of feces, unlikely to evacuate spontaneously

### Types of Constipation
- **Functional (Primary or Idiopathic)**: Chronic constipation without a known cause
- **Secondary (Organic)**: Caused by a drug or underlying medical condition

### Demographics
- Occurs at any age, more common in:
  - Women
  - Elderly
  - Pregnant individuals

### Assessment
1. Identify red flag symptoms (e.g., signs of colorectal cancer)
2. Explore understanding of constipation and normal defecation patterns (frequency, consistency)
3. Assess rectal, abdominal, or urinary symptoms
4. Determine severity and impact on daily life
5. Identify risk factors or secondary causes
6. Review self-help measures or drug treatments tried
7. Conduct abdominal and rectal examination

### Management of Chronic Constipation
- **Address Underlying Causes**: Reduce or stop causative drug treatments
- **Lifestyle Measures**: Increase dietary fiber, fluid intake, and physical activity
- **Manage Fecal Loading/Impaction First**: 
- **Drug Treatment**:
  - First-line: Bulk-forming laxatives
  - Next: Osmotic/stool-softening laxatives
  - If needed: Stimulant laxatives
  - Consider short-term prucalopride trial if symptoms persist
- **Laxative Dosing**: Gradually titrate to achieve soft, formed stools â‰¥ 3 times/week
- **Follow-up Review**: As needed

### Further Considerations if Symptoms Persist
- Blood tests to rule out underlying causes
- Assess for defecatory disorders (e.g., pelvic floor dyssynergia)
- Referral to specialists if:
  - Suspected serious causes (e.g., colorectal cancer)
  - Secondary causes not manageable in primary care
  - Symptoms persist despite optimal management
- Consider referral to local continence service or dietitian if appropriate
