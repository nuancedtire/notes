## Shoulder Pain Summary

### Causes of Shoulder Pain
**Shoulder-specific causes:**
- Rotator cuff disorders
- Frozen shoulder
- Instability disorders
- Acromioclavicular joint disorders
- Glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis
- Inflammatory arthritis
- Septic arthritis

**Other causes (referred pain):**
- Malignancy
- Referred pain from neck, heart, or lungs
- Polymyalgia rheumatica

### Assessment
**History taking should include:**
- Pain characteristics
- Stiffness and instability
- Functional impairment
- Trauma history
- Other joint symptoms
- Neck pain
- Systemic or neurological symptoms
- Occupational and sporting activities
- Medication and past musculoskeletal history
- Malignancy or significant comorbidities

**Examination should include:**
- Inspection and palpation of the shoulder
- Active and passive movements
- Examination of neck, arms, axilla, and chest for referred causes
- Neurological examination if appropriate

### Investigations
- Not usually indicated in primary care for shoulder pain.
- **Blood tests** if malignancy, polymyalgia rheumatica, or inflammatory arthritis suspected.
- **Testing for diabetes** in cases of frozen shoulder.
- **X-rays** if:
  - History of trauma
  - Little improvement with conservative treatment
  - Symptoms last over four weeks
  - Severe pain or restriction of movement
  - Suspected arthritis

### Red Flags for Urgent Referral
- Trauma with pain, weakness, or sudden loss of ability to raise the arm: suspect acute rotator cuff tear.
- Shoulder mass or swelling: suspect malignancy.
- Red skin, painful joint, fever, or systemic unwellness: suspect septic arthritis.
- Trauma leading to loss of rotation and abnormal shape: possible shoulder dislocation.
- New symptoms of inflammation in several joints: suspect inflammatory arthritis.

### Emergency Assessment
- Arrange for emergency orthopedic assessment for suspected:
  - Septic arthritis
  - Shoulder dislocation

### Initial Management
- Explain diagnosis and advise on work and activity.
- Prescribe analgesia if appropriate.
- Consider physiotherapy referral.
- Corticosteroid injection may be considered based on suspected cause and severity.
- Referral to a specialized musculoskeletal clinic may be considered for physiotherapy.
- Do not delay orthopedic referral if indicated.
  
### Referral Considerations
- Consider referral to secondary care if:
  - Pain and function do not improve after 3 months of conservative treatment.
  - Pain significantly impacts the person.
  - There is recurrent shoulder instability.
  - Severe post-traumatic pain is present.
