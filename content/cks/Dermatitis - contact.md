## Dermatitis - Contact: Summary

### Overview
- **Contact Dermatitis**: Inflammatory skin condition due to exposure to irritants or allergens.

### Types
1. **Allergic Contact Dermatitis**
   - Type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction.
   - Occurs after sensitization and re-exposure.
   - Common Allergens:
     - Personal care products (cosmetics, skin care, nail varnish, fragrances, hair dye)
     - Metals (nickel)
     - Topical medications (antibiotics, corticosteroids)
     - Plants (sunflower, primula)

2. **Irritant Contact Dermatitis**
   - Non-immunological reaction caused by direct irritation.
   - No prior sensitization needed.
   - Common Irritants:
     - Water (wet work)
     - Detergents
     - Cleaning agents
     - Acids and alkalis
     - Certain plants (ranunculus)

### Prognosis & Complications
- Variable prognosis based on causative agent and exposure avoidance.
- Complications:
  - Reduced quality of life
  - Functional impairment (impacting employment)
  - Secondary skin infections

### Clinical Presentation
- **Acute Contact Dermatitis**:
  - Erythema
  - Vesiculation
  - Dryness, scaling, bullae

- **Chronic Contact Dermatitis**:
  - Dryness
  - Lichenification (thickened skin)
  - Fissuring

- **Anatomical Distribution**: Can aid diagnosis (e.g., web spaces of fingers suggest irritant contact dermatitis).

### Investigations
- **Patch Testing**: May be required to identify causes.

### Differential Diagnoses
- Other dermatitis types (atopic, seborrhoeic)
- Skin infections (cellulitis, impetigo, fungal)
- Other skin conditions (urticaria, psoriasis, lupus erythematosus)

### Treatment of Acute Contact Dermatitis
- Avoid contact with the irritant/allergen.
- Liberal application of emollients.
- Consider topical corticosteroids (based on clinical situation).
- Treat any secondary skin infections.

### Referral to Dermatology
Consider for:
- Occupational contact dermatitis (employers must report to Health and Safety Executive).
- Severe, chronic, or recurrent dermatitis (especially on hands and face).
- Previously stable dermatitis becoming difficult to manage.
- Atypical contact dermatitis not responding to primary care measures.
