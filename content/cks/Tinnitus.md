- **Definition**: Tinnitus is the perception of sound without external auditory stimulus, often described as ringing, roaring, hissing, buzzing, clicking, pulsing, tonal, whistling, or humming.

- **Types**:
  - **Subjective Tinnitus**: Sound heard only by the individual.
  - **Objective Tinnitus**: Sound heard by both the individual and the examiner.

- **Prevalence**: Approximately 13% of adults in the UK (7.1 million people) experience prolonged tinnitus.

- **Impact**:
  - Varies among individuals; many are less affected.
  - Some may experience impaired concentration, social isolation, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and rarely, suicide.

- **Assessment and Referral Guidelines**:
  - **Audiological Assessment**: Recommended for all individuals with tinnitus.
  
  - **Immediate Referral** (within hours):
    - High risk of suicide.
    - Sudden onset of significant neurological symptoms.
    - Acute uncontrolled vestibular symptoms.
    - Suspected stroke.
    - Sudden onset pulsatile tinnitus (local pathways dependent).
    - Tinnitus secondary to head trauma.

  - **Very Urgent Referral** (within 24 hours):
    - Sudden hearing loss developing within the past 30 days.

  - **Urgent Referral** (within 2 weeks):
    - Distress affecting mental wellbeing.
    - Sudden hearing loss over 30 days ago or rapidly worsening hearing loss (4-90 days).
    - Persistent otalgia or otorrhoea not resolving with routine treatment.

  - **Referral as per local pathways**:
    - Tinnitus causing distress despite initial support.
    - Persistent objective tinnitus.
    - Tinnitus with unilateral or asymmetric hearing loss.

  - **Consider Referral**:
    - Persistent pulsatile tinnitus.
    - Persistent unilateral tinnitus.
    - Significant change in nature of tinnitus causing distress.

- **Management (if no referral needed)**:
  - Reassurance: Tinnitus is common and may resolve.
  - Address underlying causes (e.g., impacted wax).
  - Review medications; discontinue those causing tinnitus if appropriate.
  - Consider sound therapy to reduce impact.
  - Stepped approach to psychological therapies for distress.
  - Offer hearing aids for hearing loss affecting communication.
  - Address associated depression, anxiety, or insomnia.
  - Provide information and self-care advice on tinnitus.
  - Arrange follow-up care.
