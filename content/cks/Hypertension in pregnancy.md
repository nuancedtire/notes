## Hypertension in Pregnancy: Summary

### Definitions
- **Hypertension**: 
  - Diastolic BP: 90–109 mmHg
  - Systolic BP: 140–159 mmHg
- **Severe Hypertension**: 
  - Diastolic BP: ≥110 mmHg
  - Systolic BP: ≥160 mmHg

### Types of Hypertension
- **Chronic Hypertension**: 
  - Present at booking visit or before 20 weeks' gestation.
  - Blood pressure typically falls during the first and second trimesters.
  
- **[[Gestational Hypertension]]**: 
  - New hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation without significant proteinuria.
  
- **Pre-eclampsia**: 
  - New hypertension after 20 weeks' gestation with significant proteinuria.
  - Multi-system disorder affecting various organs (placenta, kidney, liver, brain).
  
- **HELLP Syndrome**: 
  - Severe form of pre-eclampsia (Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets).
  
- **Eclampsia**: 
  - Occurrence of seizures in a woman with pre-eclampsia.

### Significant Proteinuria
- Urinary protein:creatinine ratio: ≥30 mg/mmol
- Albumin:creatinine ratio: ≥8 mg/mmol
- Dipstick testing: Proteinuria of at least [1+] should prompt further testing.

### Prevention and Monitoring
- **Aspirin**: 
  - High-risk women should take 75–150 mg daily from 12 weeks' gestation until birth.
  
- **Monitoring**: 
  - Blood pressure checks and dipstick urine tests for proteinuria at each antenatal visit.

### Symptoms of Pre-eclampsia
Women should seek medical attention if they experience:
- Severe headaches (increasing frequency, unrelieved by analgesics)
- Visual problems (blurred vision, flashing lights, double vision, floating spots)
- Persistent epigastric pain or right upper quadrant pain
- Vomiting
- Breathlessness
