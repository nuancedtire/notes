- **Dyspepsia in Pregnancy**
  - Commonly caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux.
  - Involves mechanical and hormonal factors.
  - Affects up to 80% of women during pregnancy; symptoms can start at any stage.
  - Increased risk in:
    - Women with prior gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms.
    - Women with previous pregnancies.
    - Later stages of pregnancy.
  - Once symptoms develop, they often persist throughout pregnancy but typically resolve shortly after delivery.

- **Symptoms**
  - Heartburn
  - Acid reflux

- **Investigations**
  - Usually not necessary.

- **Management**
  - **First-line**: Lifestyle advice.
  - If lifestyle changes are insufficient:
    - Use antacids and alginates.
    - Acid-suppressing drugs (H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) should be a last resort if other treatments fail.

- **Referral Guidelines**
  - **Immediate**: Dyspepsia with significant acute gastrointestinal bleeding.
  - **Urgent**: Features suggestive of malignancy.
  - **Non-urgent**: Symptoms not responding to treatment or diagnostic uncertainty.
  - **Urgent based on clinical judgment**: Symptoms indicating pregnancy-related disorders other than dyspepsia.
