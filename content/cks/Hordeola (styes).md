## Styes (Hordeola) Summary

### Definition
- **Stye (Hordeolum)**: Acute localized infection/inflammation of the eyelid margin, primarily caused by staphylococcal infection.

### Types
- **External Stye**: On eyelid margin, resulting from infection of an eyelash follicle or associated gland.
- **Internal Stye**: On conjunctival surface of eyelid, caused by infection of a Meibomian gland.

### Risk Factors
- Chronic blepharitis
- Acne rosacea

### Symptoms
- Painful, localized swelling (papule or furuncle) near eyelid margin
- Typically resolves in 5â€“7 days (spontaneous rupture or drainage)

### Possible Complications
- Infective conjunctivitis
- Meibomian cyst formation
- Periorbital/orbital cellulitis (rare)

### Diagnosis Indicators
- Acute onset of unilateral symptoms (can be bilateral)
- Timeline of symptoms
- Previous episodes
- Associated eye symptoms
- Risk factors/triggers

### Assessment
- Eversion of lower/upper eyelids
- Signs of complications
- Alternative diagnoses (e.g., malignant eyelid tumor)

### Management in Primary Care
- **Reassurance**: Styes are usually self-limiting; serious complications are rare.
- **Emergency Referral**: If significant periorbital/orbital cellulitis is present.
- **Urgent Referral**: To ophthalmologist if malignant eyelid tumor suspected (within two weeks).
- **Self-Care Advice**: Warm compress application until stye drains/resolves; avoid eye makeup/contact lenses until healed.
- **Co-existing Conditions**: Manage blepharitis or acne rosacea to reduce recurrence risk.
- **Topical Antibiotics**: Prescribe only if signs of infective conjunctivitis are present.

### Symptom Relief for Painful External Stye
- **Plucking**: Remove infected eyelash to facilitate drainage.
- **Incision and Drainage**: Performed by a qualified healthcare professional if appropriate.

### Referral Considerations
- If stye does not improve with primary care management.
- If internal stye is particularly large and painful.
