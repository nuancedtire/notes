## Dyspepsia - Proven Peptic Ulcer: Summary

### Definition
- **Dyspepsia**: A complex of upper gastrointestinal symptoms lasting 4+ weeks, including:
  - Upper abdominal pain/discomfort
  - Heartburn
  - Acid reflux
  - Nausea/vomiting

### Conditions
- **GORD**: Diagnosed if heartburn and acid regurgitation are predominant.
- **Peptic Ulcer Disease**: Breach in gastric/duodenal mucosa confirmed by endoscopy.

### Risk Factors
- **Helicobacter pylori infection**
- **NSAIDs or aspirin use**

### Complications
- Haemorrhage
- Perforation
- Gastric outlet obstruction

### Initial Management
1. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Provide advice.
2. **Mental Health Assessment**: Check for stress, anxiety, and depression.
3. **Medication Review**: Stop drugs exacerbating symptoms.
4. **H. pylori Testing**:
   - Arrange if status is unknown.
   - Use carbon-13 urea breath test or stool antigen test (avoid PPIs for 2 weeks, antibiotics for 4 weeks).

### Treatment Based on Test Results
- **Positive Test with NSAID Use**:
  - Full-dose PPI for 2 months.
  - First-line H. pylori eradication therapy.
  
- **Positive Test without NSAID Use**:
  - Offer eradication therapy.
  
- **Negative Test**:
  - Full-dose PPI for 4–8 weeks.

### Follow-Up
- **Repeat Endoscopy**: For proven gastric ulcers after 6–8 weeks of treatment.
- **H. pylori Re-testing**: If appropriate.
  - If positive, offer second-line eradication therapy.
  
- **Medications**:
  - Stop NSAIDs/aspirin if possible.
  - Offer low-dose PPI or standard-dose H2RA as needed.
  
- **Long-term Treatment Considerations**:
  - Annual review.
  - Encourage stepping down or stopping treatment when possible.

### Referral to Gastroenterologist
Consider if:
- Refractory/recurrent symptoms despite optimal primary care management.
- Unsuccessful second-line H. pylori eradication.
- Limited antibiotic options for eradication.
- Proven gastric ulcer has not healed on repeat endoscopy.
- Non-peptic cause of ulcer disease is suspected.
