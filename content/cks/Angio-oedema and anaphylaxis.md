## Angio-oedema and Anaphylaxis Summary

### Angio-oedema
- **Definition**: Swelling of deep dermis, subcutaneous, or submucosal tissue, commonly affecting:
  - Face (lips, tongue, eyelids)
  - Genitalia
  - Hands and feet
  - Less common: bowel and airway swelling
  
- **Categories**:
  1. **Allergic angio-oedema**
  2. **Non-allergic drug reaction** (e.g., ACE inhibitors)
  3. **Hereditary angio-oedema** (genetic)
  4. **Acquired angio-oedema** (e.g., lymphoma, connective tissue disorders)
  5. **Idiopathic angio-oedema**

### Anaphylaxis
- **Definition**: Severe, life-threatening hypersensitivity reaction with symptoms including:
  - Rapidly developing airway/breathing/circulation problems
  - Skin and mucosal changes
  
- **Mechanism**: Involves histamine and/or bradykinin; more pronounced vascular permeability and circulatory collapse compared to angio-oedema.

### Diagnosis
- **Angio-oedema**: Based on clinical history and examination; investigations may be needed to identify triggers or exclude differential diagnoses.

- **Anaphylaxis**: Follow the ABCDE approach (Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Disability, Exposure) for recognition and management.

### Management
- **Rapidly Developing Angio-oedema (without anaphylaxis)**:
  - Administer slow IV or IM chlorphenamine and hydrocortisone.
  - Arrange for emergency admission.

- **Stable Angio-oedema (without anaphylaxis)**:
  - Identify and remove underlying cause.
  - Offer non-sedating antihistamine.
  - For severe symptoms, provide a short course of oral corticosteroids.
  - Refer to immunologist or dermatologist if the cause is unclear.

- **Anaphylaxis (medical emergency)**:
  - Call for an ambulance and seek colleague assistance.
  - If unresponsive and not breathing, start CPR immediately.
  - Administer IM adrenaline 1:1000 according to age guidelines.
  - Assess treatment response after 5 minutes; repeat dose if no improvement.
  - Continue IM adrenaline every 5 minutes until adequate response.
  - Positioning:
    - Comfortable position for airway/breathing issues (sitting up preferred).
    - Flat with leg elevation for low blood pressure.
    - Recovery position for unconscious but breathing individuals.
    - Pregnant women: lie on left side to prevent caval compression.
  - Provide high flow oxygen, IV fluid challenge, and monitor vital signs if resources allow.

### Post-Emergency Treatment for Anaphylaxis
- Offer referral to a specialist allergy service.
- Provide two adrenaline auto-injectors with instructions for use before the appointment.
