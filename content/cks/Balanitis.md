## Balanitis Summary

- **Definition**: 
  - Balanitis: Inflammation of the glans penis.
  - Posthitis: Inflammation of the prepuce (foreskin).
  - Balanoposthitis: Inflammation affecting both areas.

- **Causes**:
  - Non-specific dermatitis (Candida albicans, bacterial infection).
  - Other infections (anaerobes, STIs).
  - Inflammatory skin conditions:
    - Irritant or allergic contact dermatitis
    - Seborrhoeic dermatitis
    - Psoriasis
    - Lichen sclerosus
    - Lichen planus
    - Zoon's balanitis
  - Mechanical irritation and poor hygiene.
  - Pre-malignant conditions (penile intraepithelial neoplasia).

- **Prevalence**: Affects about 4% of uncircumcised boys aged 2-5 years.

- **Possible Complications**:
  - Phimosis and paraphimosis.
  - Urinary symptoms (urethral meatal stenosis, urethral stricture).
  - Sexual dysfunction.
  - Penile intraepithelial neoplasia and malignancy.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Suspected if there are:
    - Penile discomfort, itch, bleeding, skin splitting, urethral discharge, urinary symptoms, or sexual dysfunction.
    - Redness and swelling of the glans penis and/or foreskin; possible sub-preputial discharge, fissuring, or ulceration.
  - Assessment should include:
    - History of symptoms, hygiene practices, potential irritants/allergens, sexual history, and immunosuppression.
    - Examination of penile skin and genital area.
    - Sub-preputial swabs for Candida and bacterial culture if severe infection is suspected.
    - STI screening if clinically indicated.
    - Blood tests for HbA1c and HIV if severe or persistent.

- **Management**:
  - Good daily hygiene.
  - Information and support resources.
  - Management options based on underlying cause and age:
    - Topical corticosteroid or imidazole for non-specific dermatitis.
    - Topical imidazole or oral antifungal with topical corticosteroid for Candida.
    - Topical/oral antibiotic with topical corticosteroid for bacterial balanitis.
    - Avoiding triggers; topical corticosteroid and regular emollient for irritant/allergic contact dermatitis.
  - Manage any underlying conditions as needed.
  - Review if severe or unresponsive to initial treatment; take sub-preputial swabs.

- **Referral Criteria**:
  - Diagnostic uncertainty.
  - Persistent or recurrent balanitis not responding to treatment.
  - Persistent phimosis.
  - Suspected allergic contact dermatitis, lichen sclerosus, or Zoon's balanitis.
  - Suspected pre-malignant or malignant lesion.
