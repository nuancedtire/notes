- **Definitions**:
  - **Breathlessness**: Objective observable sign.
  - **Dyspnoea**: Subjective described symptom of difficulty in breathing.
  
- **Key Points**:
  - Anxiety is a significant component of dyspnoea.
  - Causes of dyspnoea can stem from:
    - **Direct causes**: Primary lung cancer, lung metastases.
    - **Indirect effects of cancer**: Pleural effusion, superior vena cava syndrome, anaemia, pulmonary embolism, surgery.
    - **Non-malignant causes**: Pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), heart failure, anxiety.
  
- **Assessment**:
  - **Questions to consider**:
    - Features of dyspnoea: severity, timing, onset, precipitating and exacerbating factors.
    - Associated physical symptoms: cough, sputum, haemoptysis, wheeze, stridor, pleuritic pain, fatigue, panic.
    - Impact on quality of life.
  - Conduct appropriate examination based on illness stage.
  - Consider appropriateness of investigations based on likely treatment benefits and patient wishes.

- **Investigations**:
  - Full blood count (exclude anaemia).
  - Pulse oximetry (assess hypoxia).
  - Chest X-ray (assess lung disease/heart failure).
  - Spirometry (detect possible undiagnosed COPD).
  - Electrocardiography (ECG) (exclude arrhythmias).

- **Management**:
  - **Stepwise approach** based on underlying cause and illness stage:
    - Simple measures: keep room cool, use fan, open window, relaxation/breathing techniques.
    - Encourage exercise within capabilities.
    - Adapt activities of daily living and lifestyle expectations.
    - Manage other physical symptoms, and address psychological, social, and spiritual needs.
  
  - **Medications**:
    - Strong opioids (e.g., immediate-release oral morphine).
    - Short-term benzodiazepines (for acute anxiety or end-of-life care).
    - Bronchodilator (for wheeze due to partial airway obstruction).
    - Oxygen therapy (post-specialist assessment for symptomatic hypoxia).
