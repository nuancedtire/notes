- **Platelets Overview**
  - Anucleate haematopoietic cells from bone marrow megakaryocytes.
  - Circulate for 7–10 days; cleared by reticuloendothelial system.
  
- **Normal Platelet Count**
  - Range: **150–450 × 10^9/L**

- **Definitions**
  - **Thrombocytosis**: Platelet count > **450 × 10^9/L**
  - **Thrombocytopenia**: Platelet count < **150 × 10^9/L**

- **Causes of Thrombocytosis**
  - **Primary** (clonal disorder of bone marrow stem cells):
    - Polycythaemia rubra vera
    - Chronic myeloid leukaemia
    - Essential thrombocythaemia
    - Primary myelofibrosis
    - Unspecified myeloproliferative disorders
  - **Secondary** (reactive):
    - Chronic inflammation
    - Drug therapy
    - Haemolysis
    - Iron deficiency
    - Severe systemic infections
    - Specific cancers
    - Splenectomy, hyposplenism
    - Surgery, bleeding, trauma

- **Cancer Association**
  - Thrombocytosis may indicate:
    - Lung cancer
    - Endometrial cancer
    - Gastric cancer
    - Oesophageal cancer
    - Colorectal cancer

- **Causes of Thrombocytopenia**
  - **Categories**:
    - Reduced platelet production (marrow disorders)
    - Increased platelet destruction
    - Increased platelet sequestration
  - Cancer-related causes:
    - Systemic chemotherapy
    - Radiation
    - Metastatic cancer
    - Haematological malignancies

- **Assessment of Abnormal Platelet Counts**
  - Review previous results for trends.
  - Detailed medical history and examination.
  - Consider other secondary causes.

- **Management of Abnormal Platelet Counts**
  - **For suspected cancer**: 
    - Refer using suspected cancer pathway (appointment within 2 weeks).
  - **For underlying conditions**: 
    - Manage as required.

- **Management of Thrombocytosis**
  - Urgent referral for:
    - Platelet counts > **1000 × 10^9/L**
    - Counts **600–1000 × 10^9/L** with other clinical features.
  - Referral for:
    - Persistent counts > **450 × 10^9/L**.
  - Repeat blood counts in **4–6 weeks** if asymptomatic.

- **Management of Thrombocytopenia**
  - Immediate referral for:
    - Platelet counts < **20 × 10^9/L** or active bleeding.
  - Urgent referral for:
    - Platelet counts < **50 × 10^9/L**.
    - Counts **50–100 × 10^9/L** with other clinical features.
  - Referral for:
    - Persistent counts < **100 × 10^9/L**.
  - Repeat full blood counts in **1–2 weeks** for counts **50–100 × 10^9/L** without other criteria.
