## Pulmonary Embolism (PE) Summary

### Definition
- **Pulmonary embolism (PE)**: A life-threatening condition where emboli (usually blood clots) obstruct the pulmonary arterial system, causing severe respiratory dysfunction.

### Common Source
- Most commonly arises from **deep vein thrombosis (DVT)** in the lower limbs.

### Major Risk Factors
1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
2. Recent surgery
3. Significant immobility
4. Previous DVT or PE
5. Active cancer
6. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
7. Lower limb trauma
8. Recent myocardial infarction
9. Increasing age
10. Family history of DVT
11. Pregnancy (especially within 6 weeks postpartum)

### Other Risk Factors
- Combined oral contraception or hormone replacement therapy
- Cigarette smoking
- Long-duration travel
- Obesity
- Comorbidities

### Prognosis
- **Untreated**: Poor prognosis and high risk of death.
- **Post-treatment**: Possible complications like chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

### Symptoms to Suspect PE
- Dyspnoea
- Haemoptysis
- [[Chest pain]]
- Syncope or pre-syncope
- Tachypnoea
- Features of DVT

### Diagnostic Approach
- **Initial steps**: History, physical examination, and investigations to exclude other causes (e.g., [[acute coronary syndrome]], pneumonia).
- **Immediate admission**: If:
  - Signs of haemodynamic instability
  - Pregnant or within 6 weeks postpartum

### Risk Assessment
- **PE Wells Score**:
  - > 4 points (PE likely): 
    - Hospital admission for immediate **CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA)**.
    - If CTPA isn’t available, offer interim therapeutic anticoagulation.
  - ≤ 4 points (PE unlikely):
    - Arrange **D-dimer test** (results within 4 hours).
    - If positive: Hospital admission for immediate CTPA.
      - If CTPA isn’t available, offer interim therapeutic anticoagulation.
    - If negative: Stop interim therapeutic anticoagulation and consider alternative diagnosis.

### Follow-Up Care (if PE confirmed)
- Adequate monitoring of treatment.
- Provide:
  - Anticoagulant information booklet
  - Anticoagulant alert card
  - Verbal and written information on anticoagulation treatment.
- For unprovoked PE:
  - Investigate for undiagnosed cancer.
  - Consider hereditary thrombophilia testing.
