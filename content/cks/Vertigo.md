## Vertigo: Summary

- **Definition**: 
  - Vertigo is a symptom characterized by a false sensation of movement (spinning or rotation) of oneself or surroundings without actual physical movement.

- **Impact**:
  - Adversely affects quality of life, independence, and activities such as driving and employment.
  - Increases likelihood of falls and anxiety.

- **Types of Vertigo**:
  - **Peripheral Vertigo** (more common):
    - Caused by issues with the inner ear (labyrinth or vestibular nerve).
    - Examples include:
      - Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)
      - Vestibular Neuronitis
      - Labyrinthitis
      - Menière’s Disease
  - **Central Vertigo** (uncommon):
    - Caused by pathology in the brainstem and cerebellum.
    - Examples include:
      - Stroke
      - Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA)
      - Cerebellar Tumour
      - Multiple Sclerosis

- **Examination**:
  - Assess for:
    - Facial asymmetry
    - Ear examination
    - Cranial nerve testing
    - Cerebellar function
    - Eye examination
    - Signs of peripheral neuropathy
    - Abnormal gait
  - Specific tests:
    - Romberg’s test
    - Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre
    - Head impulse test
    - Unterberger’s test
    - Alternate cover test

- **Differentiation**:
  - Use history and examination findings to distinguish between:
    - BPPV
    - Vestibular Neuronitis
    - Labyrinthitis
    - Menière's Disease
  - Suspect central causes when symptoms do not align with peripheral features, especially if:
    - Vertigo is prolonged and severe
    - New-onset headache or recent trauma is present
    - Focal neurological signs or symptoms are observed
    - Central-type nystagmus is noted
    - Abnormal response to the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre
    - Inability to stand/walk even with eyes open

- **Management**:
  - Depends on the suspected underlying cause and clinical findings.
  - May include:
    - Hospital admission for concerning features
    - Referral to a specialist for diagnosis confirmation
