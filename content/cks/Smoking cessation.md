## Smoking Cessation Summary

- **Definition**: Activities aimed at supporting individuals to stop smoking.

- **General Advice**: 
  - All smokers should be advised to quit.
  - Healthcare professionals should ask about smoking status during consultations.
  - Provide very brief advice (VBA) for cessation if the individual smokes.

- **Key Information to Gather**:
  - Smoking behavior
  - Level of nicotine dependence
  - Previous quitting attempts

- **Management for Adult Smokers**:
  - **Preferred**: Referral to local NHS Stop Smoking Services.
  - **If Declined**:
    - Inform about resources for cessation support.
    - Offer practical advice.
    - Advise abrupt cessation.
    - Discuss drug treatments to ease withdrawal (e.g., NRT, varenicline, bupropion).

- **Effective Treatments**: 
  - Varenicline and combination NRT (patch + short-acting) are most effective.
  - Note: Varenicline currently unavailable.

- **Follow-Up**:
  - Review 2 weeks post-cessation; measure CO level at 4 weeks.
  - Use professional judgment for future appointment scheduling.

- **E-Cigarettes**:
  - Advise using licensed stop smoking medicines instead.
  - If preferred, provide information and support, and refer to local services.

- **Harm Reduction Approaches** (for those unwilling to quit):
  - Continue NRT while smoking.
  - Cut down before quitting, with or without NRT.
  - Reduce smoking, with or without NRT.
  - Temporary abstinence, with or without NRT.
  - NRT may be used indefinitely to prevent relapse.

- **Priority Groups for Referral**:
  - Pregnant women, especially with CO levels of 4 ppm or more.
  - Mothers of young children (especially breastfeeding).
  - Young people aged 12-17.

- **If Referral is Declined**:
  - Provide practical advice for cessation.
  - Discuss risks and benefits of NRT.
  - Use professional judgment for prescribing NRT to pregnant women or youths with strong nicotine dependence.
  - Do not prescribe varenicline or bupropion to pregnant/breastfeeding women or under-18s.

- **If No Action Taken**:
  - Advise seeking help if they choose to stop in the future.
  - Inquire about smoking status at the next visit.
