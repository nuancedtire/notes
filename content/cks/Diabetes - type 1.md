- **Diabetes Mellitus Overview**
  - Metabolic disorder characterized by persistent hyperglycaemia (random plasma glucose > 11 mmol/L).
  - Disturbances in carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism due to defects in insulin secretion, action, or both.

- **Type 1 Diabetes**
  - Caused by absolute insulin deficiency due to autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells.
  - Without insulin replacement, can be fatal within days/weeks.
  - With insulin, individuals can lead normal lives but face various risks.

- **Complications of Type 1 Diabetes**
  - **Microvascular:** 
    - Retinopathy
    - Nephropathy
    - Neuropathy
  - **Macrovascular:** 
    - Myocardial infarction
    - Stroke
    - Peripheral arterial disease
  - **Metabolic:** 
    - Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)
    - Hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 3.5 mmol/L)
  - **Psychological:** 
    - Anxiety
    - Depression
    - Eating disorders
    - In children: behavioral/conduct disorders, family issues, risk-taking behavior.
  - **Increased risk of other autoimmune diseases:** 
    - Thyroid disease
    - Coeliac disease
    - Addison’s disease
    - Pernicious anaemia
  - **Quality of life:** 
    - Reduced quality of life and life expectancy.

- **Diagnosis in Adults**
  - Suspected with hyperglycaemia and one or more of:
    - Ketosis
    - Rapid weight loss
    - Age < 50 years (can occur ≥ 50)
    - BMI < 25 kg/m² (can occur ≥ 25)
    - Personal/family history of autoimmune disease.

- **Diagnosis in Children/Young People**
  - Suspected with hyperglycaemia and features like:
    - Polyuria
    - Polydipsia
    - Weight loss
    - Excessive tiredness.

- **Referral**
  - Adults: Immediate (same-day) referral to a multidisciplinary diabetes specialist team.
  - Children/Young people: Referral to a multidisciplinary paediatric diabetes care team.

- **Primary Care Management**
  - Ensure access to diabetes specialist services.
  - Provide care, education, information, and support from diagnosis onwards (lifestyle, insulin treatment, managing hypoglycaemia, 'sick-day rules').
  - Manage during illness.
  - Identify/manage acute complications (e.g., DKA).
  - Minimize long-term complications (e.g., cardiovascular disease, psychological disorders, retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy).
  - Screen for other autoimmune diseases where appropriate.
