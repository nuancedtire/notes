## Feverish Children - Management: Summary

- **Definition of Fever:** An infant or child is generally considered to have a fever if their temperature is 38Â°C or higher.

- **Parental Perception:** Measured and reported parental perception of fever is a valid indicator.

### Management Advice for Parents/Carers

1. **Antipyretic Drug Treatment:**
   - Use paracetamol or ibuprofen if the child is uncomfortable or distressed.
   - Stop antipyretic treatment once the child is comfortable.
   - Do not routinely treat well children with fever.
   - Avoid using aspirin as an antipyretic.
   - Do not use routine prophylactic antipyretic drugs to prevent recurrent febrile seizures.

2. **Guidance on Antipyretic Use:**
   - Choose between paracetamol or ibuprofen based on co-morbidities, drug cautions, contraindications, and parental preference.
   - Switch to ibuprofen if paracetamol alone is ineffective, and vice versa (do not give both simultaneously).
   - Consider alternating agents if both monotherapies are ineffective.
   - Use a treatment diary to record drug administration times if alternating.

### Self-Care Advice for Parents/Carers

- Provide written information and support.
- Monitor for signs of dehydration.
- Offer regular fluids and encourage increased fluid intake if dehydration signs develop.
- Dress the child appropriately for the environment (avoid underdressing or over-wrapping).
- Avoid tepid sponging to lower temperature.
- Regularly check the child, including at night.
- Keep the child away from nursery or school until recovery.
