## Neutropenic Sepsis Summary

### Definition
- **Neutropenic Sepsis**: Life-threatening complication of neutropenia (low neutrophil count).
  - **Criteria**: 
    - Temperature > 38°C
    - Symptoms/signs of sepsis
    - Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 0.5 x 10^9/L

### Sepsis Overview
- **Sepsis**: Syndrome of life-threatening organ dysfunction due to dysregulated host response to infection.
- **Febrile Neutropenia**: Common complication of anticancer treatment; fever presence in a neutropenic person.

### Causes of Neutropenia
- Cytotoxic chemotherapy
- Immunosuppressive drugs
- Stem cell transplantation
- Infections
- Bone marrow disorders (e.g., aplastic anaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes)
- Nutritional deficiencies

### Infection Risk
- Increased with:
  - Severe/prolonged neutropenia
  - Rapid decline in neutrophil count

### Possible Complications of Neutropenic Sepsis
- Organ failure
- Invasive/atypical infection
- Coagulopathy
- Encephalopathy and delirium
- Psychological sequelae
- Death

### Diagnosis
- Suspected in individuals with:
  - Known neutropenia or risk factors
  - Symptoms/signs of infection (may be minimal or atypical)
  - Unwellness
  - Temperature > 38°C (may be afebrile)
  - Clinical features of possible sepsis (may be minimal or atypical)
  - Concern from relatives about changes in appearance/behavior

### Urgent Assessment
- Evaluate physiological symptoms/signs for serious complications.

### Management
- **Initial Management** (within first hour):
  - Implement 'Sepsis Six' bundle of care.
  - Emergency transfer to hospital if critically unwell.
  - Transfer to local oncology/haematology unit or medical assessment unit if clinically stable.

### Post-Hospital Discharge Management
- Liaise with specialists for uncertainty or concerns (e.g., persistent fever).
- Provide education on sepsis, recovery expectations, and support resources.
- Advise on seeking specialist advice for symptoms/concerns, especially fever or signs of infection.
- Assess/manage complications following sepsis.
