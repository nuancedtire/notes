- **Heart Failure Overview**
  - Clinical syndrome characterized by:
    - Symptoms: breathlessness, ankle swelling, fatigue
    - Signs: elevated jugular venous pressure, basal crepitations, peripheral oedema
  - Caused by structural and/or functional abnormalities leading to:
    - Raised intracardiac pressures
    - Inadequate cardiac output (at rest or exercise)
  - **Categories**:
    - Reduced ejection fraction
    - Mildly reduced ejection fraction
    - Preserved ejection fraction

- **Symptom Severity Classification**
  - New York Heart Association functional classification

- **Common Causes**
  - Myocardial dysfunction (systolic, diastolic, or both)
  - Most common underlying pathology: coronary artery disease

- **Complications**
  - Arrhythmias
  - Depression
  - Cachexia
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Sexual dysfunction
  - Sudden cardiac death

- **Prognosis**
  - 50% of patients die within 5 years of diagnosis
  - 40% of hospitalized patients die or are readmitted within 1 year

- **Diagnosis**
  - Suspected heart failure: measure serum natriuretic peptide level
    - Normal level: unlikely diagnosis
    - Raised level: refer for specialist assessment and echocardiography
      - NT-pro-BNP:
        - >2000 ng/L (236 pmol/L): urgent referral within 2 weeks
        - 400-2000 ng/L (47â€“236 pmol/L): referral within 6 weeks
  - Additional tests:
    - 12-lead ECG
    - Consider tests for aggravating factors or other conditions
    - Loop diuretic for symptom relief while awaiting assessment

- **Management by Ejection Fraction**
  - **Reduced Ejection Fraction**:
    - Offer diuretic for fluid overload symptoms
    - Initiate ACE inhibitor + beta-blocker
    - Add mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) if symptomatic
    - Seek specialist advice if symptomatic despite treatment
  - **Mildly Reduced Ejection Fraction**:
    - Offer diuretic for fluid overload
    - Consider ACE inhibitor, beta-blocker, MRA
  - **Preserved Ejection Fraction**:
    - Offer low to medium dose diuretic if necessary
    - Arrange specialist referral if no treatment response

- **General Management for Confirmed Heart Failure**
  - Consider prescribing antiplatelet drug and statin
  - Manage comorbidities and precipitating factors
  - Screen for depression or anxiety
  - Offer supervised exercise-based rehabilitation
  - Provide appropriate vaccinations
  - Give self-care advice
  - Assess nutritional status
  - Offer follow-up and advanced care planning
  - Provide contraception and pregnancy advice for women of child-bearing age
