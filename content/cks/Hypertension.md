## Hypertension: Quick Reference Guide

### Definition
- **Hypertension**: Persistently raised arterial blood pressure.
  
### Risks
- Increases risk of:
  - Heart failure
  - Coronary artery disease
  - Stroke
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Peripheral arterial disease
  - Vascular dementia

### Types
1. **Primary Hypertension**: 
   - Occurs in ~90% of cases.
   - No identifiable cause.
   
2. **Secondary Hypertension**:
   - Occurs in ~10% of cases.
   - Known causes: renal, endocrine, vascular disorders, certain drugs.

### Diagnosis
- Suspected if:
  - Clinic systolic BP ≥ 140 mmHg
  - Diastolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg
- Confirmation via:
  - Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM)
  - Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM)

### Initial Management
- Investigate for:
  - Target organ damage
  - Secondary causes of hypertension
- Assess cardiovascular risk.

### Classification by Severity
1. **Stage 1 Hypertension**:
   - Clinic BP: 140/90 mmHg to 159/99 mmHg
   - ABPM/HBPM: 135/85 mmHg to 149/94 mmHg

2. **Stage 2 Hypertension**:
   - Clinic BP: 160/100 mmHg to <180/120 mmHg
   - ABPM/HBPM: ≥ 150/95 mmHg

3. **Stage 3 or Severe Hypertension**:
   - Clinic systolic BP ≥ 180 mmHg
   - Clinic diastolic BP ≥ 120 mmHg

4. **Accelerated (Malignant) Hypertension**:
   - BP ≥ 180/120 mmHg, often > 220/120 mmHg
   - Signs: retinal haemorrhage, papilloedema.

5. **White-Coat Hypertension**:
   - Elevated BP during clinical visits but normal otherwise.

### Referral Criteria
- Same-day specialist assessment for:
  - Clinic BP ≥ 180/120 mmHg with retinal changes or life-threatening symptoms (e.g., confusion, [[chest pain]]).
  - Suspected phaeochromocytoma (symptoms: labile BP, headache, palpitations).

### Management for Other Patients
- **Lifestyle Advice**:
  - Diet and exercise
  - Stress management
  - Alcohol moderation
  - Smoking cessation
   
- **Antihypertensive Treatment**:
  - Initiated in a stepwise approach.

- **Statin Treatment**:
  - Based on cardiovascular risk assessment.

- **Monitoring**:
  - Response to lifestyle changes and medications.
  - Annual review for BP, medication, lifestyle support.

### Target Blood Pressures
- **Ages < 80**:
  - Clinic BP < 140/90 mmHg
  - ABPM/HBPM < 135/85 mmHg

- **Ages ≥ 80**:
  - Clinic BP < 150/90 mmHg
  - ABPM/HBPM < 145/85 mmHg

- **Postural Hypertension**:
  - Targets based on standing blood pressure.

- **Frailty or Multimorbidity**:
  - Use clinical judgment for targets.
