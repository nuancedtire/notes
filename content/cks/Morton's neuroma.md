## Morton's Neuroma Summary

### Definition
- **Morton's neuroma**: Compression neuropathy of the common digital plantar nerve, primarily affecting the foot.

### Locations
- **Most common**: Third intermetatarsal space (66% of cases)
- **Less common**: Second intermetatarsal space (30% of cases)
- **Rarely**: First and fourth intermetatarsal spaces
- **Bilateral occurrence**: 21% of cases
- **Nature**: Benign fibrotic thickening of the nerve due to constant irritation (not a true neuroma).

### Histology
- Findings include:
  - Perineural fibrosis
  - Neural degeneration
  - Demyelination
- Lacks typical features of a neoplastic or proliferative process.

### Alternate Names
- Morton metatarsalgia
- Interdigital neuritis
- Morton entrapment
- Interdigital neuralgia
- Interdigital neuroma
- Interdigital nerve compression syndrome
- Intermetatarsal neuroma

### Mechanisms of Irritation
- Chronic, repetitive trauma
- Nerve ischaemia
- Intermetatarsal bursitis
- Compression or entrapment of the nerve

### Risk Factors
- High-arch feet
- Tight/ill-fitting shoes (squeezing forefoot)
- Repetitive, heavy impact (e.g., running, dancing, athletics)
- More common in women (4 times more than men)
- Mean age of presentation: 50â€“55 years

### Symptoms
- Forefoot pain, primarily in the third intermetatarsal space
- Pain exacerbated by activity or specific footwear; relieved by removing footwear or massaging toes
- Sensation of a 'pebble' or 'lump' under the metatarsal region
- Sharp, stabbing, burning, or tingling sensations (electric shock-like)

### Management
1. **First-line**:
   - Avoid shoes with thin soles, high heels, or constricting toe boxes
   - Use of metatarsal pads (available OTC)
   - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (if necessary)

2. **Further action**:
   - If symptoms persist for more than 3 months with footwear modifications:
     - Referral to an orthotist for a metatarsal dome orthotic
     - If unsuccessful, referral to:
       - Orthopaedic surgeon (foot specialist)
       - Musculoskeletal clinic
       - Podiatric surgeon

3. **Specialist treatments**:
   - Corticosteroid injection
   - Surgery (if indicated)
