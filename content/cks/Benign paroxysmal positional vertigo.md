- **Definition**: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is an inner ear disorder characterized by repeated episodes of positional vertigo, triggered by changes in head position.

- **Precipitating Factors**:
  - Head injury
  - Prolonged recumbent position (e.g., during dental visits)
  - Ear surgery
  - Inner ear pathologies (e.g., vestibular neuronitis, labyrinthitis, Meniere's disease)

- **Epidemiology**:
  - Most common cause of vertigo in clinical practice
  - Affects all ages, typically between 50-70 years
  - More prevalent in women

- **Course**: 
  - Often relapsing and remitting
  - Spontaneous recovery may occur, but recurrence is common

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Confirm symptoms of vertigo related to specific head movements (e.g., turning in bed, looking up, bending over)
  - Use the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre to demonstrate characteristic findings
  - Consider differential diagnoses (e.g., Meniereâ€™s disease, vestibular neuronitis, anxiety disorder)
  - Imaging (MRI or CT) not required unless to exclude other conditions (e.g., atypical nystagmus or neurological symptoms)

- **Management**:
  - Discuss watchful waiting to see if symptoms resolve without treatment
  - Explain that treatment may expedite symptom resolution
  - Offer particle repositioning manoeuvre (e.g., Epley manoeuvre) and consider Brandt-Daroff exercises
  - Symptomatic drug treatment generally ineffective
  - Advise follow-up in 4 weeks if symptoms persist

- **Referral Criteria**:
  - If canalith repositioning expertise is unavailable in primary care
  - If physical limitations hinder safety or practicality of procedures
  - If symptoms persist after repeated procedures
  - If symptoms/signs are atypical
  - If symptoms have not resolved in 4 weeks

- **Emergency Situations**:
  - Hospital admission for severe nausea, vomiting, or inability to tolerate oral fluids
