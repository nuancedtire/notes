## Baker's Cyst Summary

### Definition
- **Baker's cyst**: Distension of the gastrocnemius-semimembranosus bursa behind the knee; not a true cyst.

### Types
1. **Primary Baker's cysts**: 
   - Not associated with knee joint disease.
   - Common in children.
   
2. **Secondary Baker's cysts**: 
   - Associated with underlying knee joint disease.
   - Typically communicate with the knee joint.
   - Almost all adult cases are secondary.

### Prevalence
- Varies by population, definition, and diagnostic method.
- Peak incidence: 
  - Ages 4-7 
  - Ages 35-70

### Causes
- **In Children**:
  - Primary cysts may arise from trauma or irritation.
  - Secondary cysts may occur in conditions like juvenile idiopathic arthritis and osteochondritis dissecans.

- **In Adults**:
  - Typically secondary to:
    - Arthropathies (e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis).
    - Soft tissue injuries (e.g., meniscal tears, ACL damage).

### Complications
- Chronic pain
- Dissection or rupture
- Hemorrhage
- Compression of adjacent structures
- Infection

### Assessment
- **History**:
  - Swelling and knee joint symptoms.
  - Underlying causes (arthropathies, soft tissue injury).
  - Complications (cyst rupture, DVT).
  
- **Examination**:
  - Assess joint swelling and stability.
  - Look for ligament or meniscal injury.
  
- **Diagnostics**:
  - Ultrasound for confirmation and to rule out serious conditions in children.
  - In adults, history and examination may suffice.

### Management
- **In Children**:
  - Urgent assessment in case of serious alternative diagnosis (e.g., DVT).
  - Reassurance that primary cysts usually resolve without treatment if no underlying disease is suspected.
  - Referral to specialists if symptoms are troublesome or diagnosis is unclear.

- **In Adults**:
  - Same-day assessment for suspected DVT.
  - Management of underlying conditions (e.g., osteoarthritis).
  - Advise that asymptomatic cysts may resolve with treatment of underlying conditions.
  - Consider analgesia and physiotherapy for troublesome symptoms.
  - Referral to rheumatologist or orthopaedic surgeon if unclear diagnosis, persistent symptoms, or large cyst.
