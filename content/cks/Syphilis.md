- **Syphilis Overview**
  - Infectious disease caused by *Treponema pallidum* (spirochete bacterium).
  - Primarily sexually transmitted through contact with infectious lesions.

- **Stages of Syphilis**
  - **Early Syphilis** (within 2 years of infection)
    - Primary Syphilis: Characterized by a painless genital ulcer (chancre).
    - Secondary Syphilis: Non-pruritic maculopapular rash (often on palms and soles), moist wart-like lesions (condylomata lata), patchy oral mucosal lesions, generalized lymphadenopathy.
    - Early Latent Syphilis: Asymptomatic, but infection is present.
  - **Late Syphilis** (more than 2 years after infection)
    - Late Latent Syphilis: Asymptomatic, but infection still present.
    - Tertiary Syphilis: Severe complications can occur.

- **Complications of Untreated Syphilis**
  - **Neurosyphilis**: Affects neurological systems (meninges, brain, spinal cord, etc.).
  - **Cardiovascular Syphilis**: Can lead to aortic aneurysm, regurgitation, heart failure.
  - **Gummatous Syphilis**: Granulomatous lesions affecting skin and bones.
  - Adverse pregnancy outcomes.
  - Increased risk of HIV transmission.

- **Diagnosis Indicators**
  - History/presence of:
    - Genital lesions (painless indurated ulcer).
    - Non-pruritic rash on palms/soles.
    - Moist lesions (condylomata lata).
    - Oral mucosal lesions.
    - Generalized lymphadenopathy.
    - Unexplained neurological or ophthalmological symptoms.
  - Risk factors: Unprotected sex, multiple/anonymous partners, transactional sex.

- **Referral and Testing**
  - Refer suspected cases to GUM clinic or sexual health services.
  - Advise to avoid sexual contact until diagnosis or treatment is confirmed.
  - If HIV positive, referral options include infectious diseases clinic or HIV centre.
  - Testing may include:
    - Swabs from active lesions.
    - Serology tests (availability may vary).
  - Test result interpretation may require specialist input; repeat testing often necessary.

- **Management**
  - Positive test results should lead to strong recommendations for GUM clinic referral for management and partner notification.
  - If referral is refused, seek advice from a GUM specialist.
  - Offer additional screening for other STIs.

- **Legal Considerations**
  - Individuals who decline testing or treatment but infect others may face prosecution.
