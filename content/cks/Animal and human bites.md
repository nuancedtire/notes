### Bite Wounds Overview

- **Definition**: Injury caused by the teeth of humans or animals.
- **Types of Bite Wounds**:
  - Abrasions
  - Lacerations
  - Puncture wounds
  - Crush/degloving injuries

### Types of Human Bites
1. **Occlusal Injuries**: Caused by actual biting.
2. **Clenched-Fist Injuries**: Result from a fist hitting teeth, often during fights, leading to small wounds over metacarpophalangeal joints.

### Animal Bites
- **Dog Bites**: 
  - Characterized by puncture wounds from canine teeth.
  - Can cause shearing and tearing of tissues.
  - Most common type of mammalian bite.
  
- **Cat Bites**:
  - Inflict deep puncture wounds with sharp teeth.
  - Saliva can introduce bacteria; capable of penetrating bone, joints, and tendons.

### Infection Risks
- **Bacterial Infections**:
  - Risks include cellulitis, abscesses, tenosynovitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, and systemic infections (sepsis, meningitis, endocarditis, organ abscesses).
  
- **Tetanus**: 
  - Possible after bites, especially in puncture wounds with debris.
  - Rare after human bites.

- **Rabies**:
  - Rare in the UK; however, risk exists in parts of Africa and Asia following dog bites.

### Management of Bite Wounds
1. **Documentation**: Record circumstances of the bite and examine the wound.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risk for tetanus, blood-borne viruses (human bites), or rabies (animal bites).

3. **Management Steps**:
   - Remove foreign bodies (e.g., teeth).
   - Encourage bleeding if not already present.
   - Irrigate thoroughly with warm water or saline.
   - Consider debridement.
   - Provide analgesia (ibuprofen or paracetamol).
   - Refer to Accident and Emergency for further assessment if needed.

4. **Antibiotic Prophylaxis**:
   - **Human Bites**: 
     - Prescribe for 3 days if skin is broken and blood is drawn, involves high-risk areas, or if infection risk is high.
   - **Animal Bites**:
     - **Cat Bites**: 3-day prophylaxis if skin is broken and blood is drawn.
     - **Dog/Other Pets**: 3-day prophylaxis if wound is deep, clinically infected, or involves high-risk areas.
   - **Clinically Infected Wounds**: 
     - 5-day antibiotic treatment (first-line: co-amoxiclav; second-line depends on age).

5. **Special Considerations**:
   - Seek advice for individuals at risk of HIV or hepatitis B.
   - Assess need for tetanus and rabies prophylaxis.
