- **Definition**: Raynaud's phenomenon is episodic vasospasm of the arteries or arterioles, primarily affecting extremities (digits), leading to color changes: 
  - Pallor
  - Cyanosis
  - Rubor

- **Classification**:
  - **Primary Raynaud's phenomenon**: 
    - 80–90% of cases
    - Occurs without an underlying condition
  - **Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon**: 
    - 10–20% of cases
    - Associated with underlying conditions (e.g., connective tissue disorders like scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus)

- **Symptoms**:
  - Episodes of pallor followed by cyanosis and/or erythema
  - Precipitating factors: cold exposure, emotional stress
  - Diagnosis requires blanching (tri-phasic color change may not always be evident)

- **Onset**:
  - Primary: Usually in second or third decade; can occur at any age
  - More common in women than men
  - Uncommon in children under 12; underlying causes should be investigated

- **Suspicion of Secondary Raynaud’s** if:
  - Digital ulcers, gangrene, or ischemia present
  - Onset after age 30
  - Episodes are intense, painful, or asymmetrical
  - Features suggestive of connective tissue disorder (e.g., sclerodactyly, pitting scars)
  - Positive anti-nuclear antibody tests
  - Abnormal nail-fold capillaries

- **Primary Raynaud’s** suspected if:
  - Episodes are completely reversible
  - No features of secondary Raynaud’s

- **Emergency**: Immediate admission for severe ischemia of digits

- **Referral Recommendations**:
  - Children aged 12 or younger with Raynaud's features
  - Individuals with suspected secondary Raynaud's

- **Lifestyle Measures**:
  - Keep the body warm; wear gloves and warm footwear
  - Avoid sudden temperature changes
  - Avoid or quit smoking
  - Minimize stress
  - Regular exercise

- **Medical Treatment**:
  - Consider nifedipine if lifestyle measures fail (significant negative impact)
  - Specialist advice needed for ages 13-17
  - Adults (18+): Consider immediate- or modified-release nifedipine (off-label)
  - Up to 75% may experience adverse effects (e.g., edema, palpitations, headache, flushing, dizziness)
  
- **Referral**: If symptoms are poorly controlled despite treatment
