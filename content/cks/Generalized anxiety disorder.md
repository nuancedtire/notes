- **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**
  - Characterized by excessive worry about everyday issues, disproportionate to actual risk.
  - Symptoms (at least three present most of the time):
    - Restlessness or nervousness
    - Easily fatigued
    - Poor concentration
    - Irritability
    - Muscle tension
    - Sleep disturbance
  - Symptoms must last for at least 6 months and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in critical areas (social, occupational, etc.).

- **Nature of GAD**
  - Chronic condition with fluctuating severity.
  - Low rates of short- and medium-term remission.

- **Classification Systems**
  - American Psychiatric Association's DSM-5-TR
  - WHO International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11)

- **Prevalence**
  - Most common psychiatric disorder; occurs in 4-7.9% of primary care patients.
  - Under-diagnosed: <50% seek treatment, <33% receive adequate treatment.
  - Most common age group: 35-55 years.

- **Risk Factors**
  - Female sex
  - Comorbid anxiety disorders
  - Family history of anxiety disorders
  - Childhood adversity
  - History of sexual or emotional trauma
  - Sociodemographic factors

- **Complications**
  - Distress and substantial disability
  - Impaired quality of life
  - Impaired social and occupational functioning
  - Comorbidities
  - Suicidal ideation and attempts

- **Suspected Diagnosis**
  - Chronic, excessive, non-circumstantial worry.
  - Symptoms of physiological arousal (restlessness, insomnia, muscle tension).
  - Consider in patients with:
    - Chronic physical health problems
    - Somatic symptom reassurance-seeking (especially older adults or minority ethnic groups)
    - Widespread worrying

- **Assessment Tools**
  - Use validated questionnaires (GAD-2, GAD-7) for severity.

- **Management Approach**
  - Stepped-care model:
    - Treat primary disorder first if comorbidities (e.g., depression) exist.
    - For mild symptoms, consider active monitoring.
    - If no resolution, offer low-intensity psychological interventions (self-help, psychoeducational group therapy).
    - If marked impairment or unresolved symptoms, offer high-intensity psychological interventions (applied relaxation, cognitive behavioral therapy) or drug therapy based on patient preference.

- **Preferred Treatments**
  - First-line drug therapy: Selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
  - Alternative if SSRIs not tolerated: Serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or pregabalin.

- **Referral and Follow-Up**
  - Refer for specialist treatment if GAD is complex, treatment-refractory, marked functional impairment, or high self-harm risk.
  - Regular follow-up to monitor treatment progress.
