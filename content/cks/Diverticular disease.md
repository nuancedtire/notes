## Diverticular Disease Summary

### Definitions
- **Diverticula**: Sac-like protrusions of mucosa through the muscular wall of the colon, predominantly found in the sigmoid colon (80% in those over 85).
- **Diverticulosis**: Presence of diverticula without symptoms; may cause painless rectal bleeding or be found incidentally.
- **Diverticular Disease**: Symptoms arise from diverticula (e.g., intermittent lower abdominal pain) without inflammation/infection.
- **Diverticulitis**: Inflammation and infection of diverticula, presenting with:
  - Severe lower abdominal pain
  - Fever
  - General malaise
  - Change in bowel habit
  - Occasional rectal bleeding

### Types of Diverticulitis
- **Uncomplicated**: Inflammation without peritoneal involvement.
- **Complicated**: Involves complications such as abscess, peritonitis, fistula, obstruction, or perforation.

### Prevalence
- Rare before age 40; risk increases with age.
- Symptoms typically in the left lower abdomen but may be right-sided in some individuals, especially those of Asian origin.

### Assessment
- History-taking
- Abdominal examination
- Imaging or endoscopy for diagnosis confirmation

### Management of Confirmed Diverticulosis
- **Considerations**:
  - Bulk-forming laxatives for constipation
  - Dietary advice: Increase fiber intake
  - Ensure adequate fluid intake
  - Promote exercise, weight loss (if obese), and smoking cessation

### Management of Confirmed Diverticular Disease
- **Urgent Admission**: For significant rectal bleeding.
- **Avoid**: NSAIDs and opioid analgesics (e.g., codeine).
- **Advice**:
  - Diet and lifestyle modifications
  - Fluid intake
  - Smoking cessation
  - Weight loss and exercise
  - When to seek medical advice
- **Considerations**:
  - Bulk-forming laxatives
  - Simple analgesia or antispasmodics
  - Reassessment if symptoms persist or do not respond to treatment

### Management of Suspected Uncomplicated Diverticulitis (Primary Care)
- **Antibiotics**: Offer if systemically unwell, immunosuppressed, or have significant comorbidities; consider no antibiotic strategy if systemically well.
- **Analgesia**: Advise use and when to re-present if symptoms persist or worsen.
- **Reassessment**: If symptoms persist or deteriorate; consider referral to secondary care.
- **Referral**: To colorectal surgery specialist for frequent/severe recurrent episodes of acute diverticulitis.
