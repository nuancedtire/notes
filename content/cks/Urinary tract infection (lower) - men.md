## Urinary Tract Infection (Lower) - Men: Summary

### Overview
- **Definition**: UTI is an infection of any part of the urinary tract, primarily caused by bacteria.
- **Common Cause**: Escherichia coli in adults.
- **Type**: Lower UTI refers specifically to bladder infections.

### Incidence
- **Men vs. Women**: Less common in men, but higher incidence in older men or those with risk factors:
  - Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH)
  - Urine outflow obstruction
  - Catheterization (second most common hospital-acquired infection)
  - Previous urinary tract surgery
  - Immunosuppression

### Complications
- Renal function impairment
- Prostatitis
- Pyelonephritis
- Sepsis
- Urinary stones

### Symptoms
- Dysuria, frequency, urgency, nocturia, suprapubic pain
- Additional signs: suprapubic tenderness, odorous/cloudy urine, haematuria
- Atypical symptoms may occur in frail, elderly men or those with indwelling catheters

### Diagnosis
- Confirm UTI with a urine sample for culture and sensitivity before antibiotics.
- Avoid reliance on urine dipstick tests or microscopy.
- Clinical judgment is crucial for men with indwelling catheters.

### Differential Diagnosis
- Acute prostatitis
- Bladder or renal malignancy
- Epididymitis
- Pyelonephritis
- Urethritis

### Management
1. **Severe Symptoms**: Arrange hospital admission if symptoms include nausea, confusion, tachypnoea, tachycardia, or hypotension.
2. **Antibiotic Treatment**:
   - Non-catheterized men: Trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin for 7 days.
   - Catheterized men: Trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, or amoxicillin for 7 days; consider pivmecillinam if first-line unsuitable.
3. **Follow-Up**: Check treatment response and urine culture results after 48 hours.
4. **Information and Advice**: Provide appropriate guidance.
5. **Referral**: Not routinely required for uncomplicated cases.

### Management of Recurrent UTI
- **Urine Culture**: Obtain on each occasion before antibiotics.
- **Treatment**: Manage each episode as acute lower UTI.
- **Specialist Advice**: Seek for further investigation and management.
- **Prophylaxis**: Consider daily antibiotics (e.g., trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin at night).
- **Referral for Urological Assessment**: Offer if:
  - Ongoing symptoms despite treatment
  - Possible underlying cause/risk factor
  - Recurrent episodes (2+ in 6 months)

### Urological Cancer Referral
- Urgent referral via a suspected cancer pathway for individuals suspected of having urological cancer, aiming for an appointment within 2 weeks.
