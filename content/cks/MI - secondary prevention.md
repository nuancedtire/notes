## Myocardial Infarction (MI) - Secondary Prevention Summary

### Definition
- **Myocardial Infarction (MI)**: Necrosis of myocardial tissue due to ischemia from coronary artery blockage (thrombus).

### Classification of MI
1. **ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)**: 
   - Complete and persistent artery blockage leading to myocardial necrosis.
2. **Non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI)**: 
   - Partial or intermittent artery blockage with myocardial necrosis.
3. **Unstable Angina**: 
   - Partial or intermittent blockage without myocardial necrosis.

### Relationship to [[Acute Coronary Syndrome]] (ACS)
- STEMI and NSTEMI are part of a spectrum of conditions known as ACS, which includes unstable angina.

### Prevalence in the UK (British Heart Foundation estimates)
- ~2.3 million people living with coronary heart disease (CHD).
- ~100,000 hospital admissions annually due to MIs.
- ~1.4 million MI survivors.

### Possible Complications of MI
- Heart failure
- [[Angina]]
- Arrhythmias
- Depression
- Sudden death (e.g., due to another MI or arrhythmia)

### Secondary Prevention Measures
- **Initiated after initial treatments for acute MI to reduce complications and further cardiovascular events.**
  
#### 1. Cardiac Rehabilitation
- Start as soon as possible post-admission, before hospital discharge.

#### 2. Drug Treatments
- Typically involves:
  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists for those intolerant to ACE inhibitors).
  - Dual antiplatelet therapy.
  - Beta-blockers.
  - Statins.

#### 3. Lifestyle Modification
- Focus on:
  - Diet
  - Physical activity
  - Alcohol consumption
  - Smoking cessation
  - Weight management

### Hospital Discharge Summary Should Include
- Diagnosis confirmation of acute MI.
- Results of investigations.
- Details and timing of drug titration.
- Monitoring requirements (blood pressure, renal function).
- Future management and follow-up plans.
- Advice on secondary prevention.

### Primary Care Management Post-MI
- Encourage participation in cardiac rehabilitation.
- Prescribe and monitor secondary prevention drug treatments.
- Reinforce lifestyle advice and support (e.g., weight loss, smoking cessation).
- Manage other risk factors (hypertension, diabetes).
- Address complications ([[angina]], depression).
- Encourage follow-up assessments.
- Address patient concerns (returning to work, resuming activities).
- Provide information on economic issues, welfare rights, housing, and social support.
