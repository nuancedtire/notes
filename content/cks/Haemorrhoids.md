## Haemorrhoids Summary

### Definition
- Haemorrhoids (piles): Abnormally swollen vascular mucosal cushions in the anal canal.

### Classification
- **External Haemorrhoids**: 
  - Origin: Below the dentate line.
  - Epithelium: Modified squamous epithelium (anoderm).
  - Sensitivity: Painful and itchy due to rich innervation.
  
- **Internal Haemorrhoids**: 
  - Origin: Above the dentate line.
  - Epithelium: Columnar epithelium (no pain fibres).
  - Sensitivity: Not sensitive unless strangulated.

### Grading of Internal Haemorrhoids
1. **First degree**: Project into the anal canal but do not prolapse.
2. **Second degree**: Prolapse on straining but reduce spontaneously.
3. **Third degree**: Prolapse on straining and require manual reduction.
4. **Fourth degree**: Prolapsed, incarcerated, and cannot be reduced.

### Contributing Factors
- Constipation
- Straining during defecation
- Ageing
- Heavy lifting
- Chronic cough
- Conditions causing raised intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., pregnancy, childbirth, space-occupying lesions)

### Complications
- Ulceration
- Skin tags
- Maceration of perianal skin
- Ischaemia, thrombosis, or gangrene
- Rarely: Perianal sepsis and anaemia from bleeding

### Diagnosis
- Important to conduct a thorough history and physical examination.
- Exclude serious underlying pathology (e.g., colorectal cancer).

### Symptoms
- Bright red, painless rectal bleeding (common).
  - Occurs with defecation, seen as streaks on toilet paper, in the toilet bowl, or outside stool.
- Other symptoms may include:
  - Anal itching or irritation
  - Rectal fullness or discomfort
  - Incomplete evacuation
  - Soiling
  - Anal pain (with prolapsed, strangulated internal haemorrhoids, or thrombosed external haemorrhoids)

### Management
1. **Conservative**:
   - Ensure soft stools.
   - Prescribe laxatives if constipated.
   - Provide lifestyle advice (reduce straining, maintain anal hygiene).
   - Offer symptomatic relief (analgesia, topical haemorrhoidal preparations).

2. **Referral Criteria**:
   - Unclear diagnosis or suspected serious pathology.
   - Severe symptoms not manageable in primary care.
   - Lack of response to conservative treatment.
   - Recurrence of symptoms unresponsive to primary care.

### Treatment Options
- **Non-surgical**:
  - Rubber band ligation
  - Injection sclerotherapy
  - Infrared coagulation/photocoagulation
  - Bipolar diathermy and direct-current electrotherapy

- **Surgical**:
  - Haemorrhoidectomy
  - Stapled haemorrhoidectomy
  - Haemorrhoidal artery ligation
