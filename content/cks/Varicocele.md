## Varicocele Summary

- **Definition**: A varicocele is a scrotal swelling from dilated veins of the pampiniform plexus in the spermatic cord.

- **Prevalence**: 
  - Occurs in ~20% of men in the general population.
  - About 90% occur on the left side due to differing drainage routes of right and left spermatic veins.
  
- **Onset**: Typically becomes apparent at puberty due to testicular growth and increased blood flow.

- **Grading**:
  - **Sub-clinical**: Detected only by Doppler ultrasound.
  - **Grade I (small)**: Palpable only with Valsalva manoeuvre.
  - **Grade II (moderate)**: Palpable without Valsalva manoeuvre.
  - **Grade III (large)**: Visible through the scrotal skin.

- **Symptoms**:
  - Often asymptomatic; may present as scrotal swelling or pain.
  - Up to 3% may experience vague dragging sensations or aching in the scrotum/groin.
  - Characteristic presentation: 'bag of worms' above the testis on the left side, more palpable when standing and during Valsalva manoeuvre.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Primarily clinical; ultrasound with colour flow Doppler imaging may be used in cases of uncertainty or difficulty in examination.

- **Management**:
  - **Most cases**: No treatment required; reassurance provided.
  - **Referral**: 
    - Urgent if varicocele appears suddenly or remains tense when lying down.
    - If nature of scrotal swelling is uncertain.
    - Routinely if causing pain or discomfort.
    - Adolescents: Refer to urologist for concerns about testicular volume or if symptoms or appearance cause significant concern.

- **Advice for Non-referred Cases**:
  - Reassure that most varicoceles do not lead to symptoms or long-term complications.
  - Manage discomfort with supportive underwear and simple analgesia.
  - Explain that while varicoceles can be associated with fertility issues, nearly two-thirds of affected men can father children without difficulty.
