## Summary of Chronic Pancreatitis

### Definition
- Chronic pancreatitis: Irreversible inflammation/fibrosis of the pancreas.

### Key Features
- Severe pain
- Progressive endocrine and exocrine insufficiency

### Types of Insufficiency
1. **Endocrine Insufficiency**:
   - Damage to islets of Langerhans
   - Insulin deficiency → Non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, pancreatogenic diabetes

2. **Exocrine Insufficiency**:
   - Damage to acinar cells
   - Decreased digestive enzyme secretion → Maldigestion and malabsorption

### Causes
- Major Cause: Alcohol (70-80% of cases)
- Other Risk Factors:
  - Smoking
  - Hypertriglyceridaemia
  - Hypercalcaemia
  - Autoimmune disease
  - Obstructive causes
  - Genetic factors
  - Drugs

### Incidence
- Increasing over the past decade

### Complications
- Maldigestion and malabsorption
- Malnutrition
- Pancreatogenic diabetes
- Chronic pain
- Osteoporosis and osteopenia
- Pancreatic cancer
- Pancreatic calcification, stones, strictures, fistulae
- Pseudocyst
- Pseudoaneurysm

### Diagnosis Indicators
- Recurrent or persistent abdominal pain (especially with history of alcohol misuse)
- Assessment includes:
  - Duration and characteristics of pain
  - Associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, weight loss)
  - Family history
- Physical examination for:
  - Signs of malnutrition
  - Chronic liver disease
  - Jaundice
  - Abdominal tenderness/distension
- Investigations:
  - Serum liver function tests
  - HbA1c
  - Faecal elastase
  - Abdominal ultrasound

### Management
1. **Suspected Chronic Pancreatitis**:
   - Urgent hospital admission for suspected acute pancreatitis
   - Urgent referral for suspected serious complications
   - Routine referral for diagnosis confirmation

2. **Confirmed Chronic Pancreatitis**:
   - Information and support resources
   - Management of risk factors (alcohol, smoking)
   - Pain management
   - Management of malabsorption/malnutrition:
     - Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy
     - Fat-soluble vitamin supplements
     - Nutritional status monitoring
   - Screening for diabetes and osteoporosis

3. **Referral Considerations**:
   - Suspected pancreatic cancer
   - Suspected acute pancreatitis
   - Uncontrolled/recurrent pain or symptom changes
   - Complications requiring specialist management (e.g., dietitian for malnutrition)
