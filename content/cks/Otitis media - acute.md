  - Exposed to passive smoking
  - Attending daycare/nursery
  - Formula-fed
  - With craniofacial abnormalities (e.g., cleft palate)

### Complications
- Recurrence of infection
- Hearing loss
- Tympanic membrane perforation
- Rarely: mastoiditis, meningitis, intracranial abscess, sinus thrombosis, facial nerve paralysis

### Symptoms

- **Younger Children**:

- Children <3 months with temperature ≥38°C

### Management of Persistent AOM
- Reassess patient
