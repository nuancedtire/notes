## Knee Pain - Assessment Summary

### Overview
- **Common Condition**: Particularly prevalent in older individuals.
- **Possible Causes**:
  - Osteoarthritis
  - Injuries (muscle strain, ligament damage, fractures)
  - Inflammatory conditions
  - Infection
  - Tumours
  - Referred pain (hip or lumbosacral spine)
  - Bursitis

### Risk Factors
- Increasing age
- Obesity
- Knee-straining occupations
- Participation in sports

### Patient Assessment
1. **History Taking**:
   - Trauma history
   - Description of pain/injury (type, duration, aggravating/relieving factors, swelling history)

2. **Physical Examination**:
   - Inspection
   - Palpation
   - Range of motion evaluation
  
3. **Injury Assessment** (if trauma present):
   - Check for fractures, tendon ruptures, ligament tears
   - Neurovascular assessment

### Red Flags
- **Infection**: Septic arthritis, osteomyelitis
- **Tumours**
- **Inflammatory Polyarthritis**
- **Significant injuries**: Fractures, dislocations, tendon/ligament ruptures

### Recommendations for Immediate Action
- **Admission/Referral**: 
  - Septic arthritis
  - Slipped capital femoral epiphysis
  - Fractures
  - Neurovascular damage
  - Quadriceps/patellar tendon rupture
  - Severe soft tissue injury with instability
  - First-time traumatic patellar dislocation
  - Recurrent dislocation with swelling

- **Immediate Referral**:
  - Signs of joint infection (fever, erythema, swelling)
  - Severe pain, swelling, instability, inability to weight bear with acute injury

- **Special Considerations**:
  - Child with a limp or suspected Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura
  - Significant soft tissue injury suspected in acute knee pain post-trauma

### Further Referrals
- **Tumour suspicion**: Urgent referral to specialist
- **Inflammatory Polyarthritis suspicion**: Urgent referral to rheumatologist/paediatric rheumatologist
- **Persistent symptoms or uncertain diagnosis**: Referral to integrated musculoskeletal service, physiotherapist, or orthopaedic surgeon
