## Sepsis Overview

- **Definition**: Life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection.
- **Septic Shock**: A subset of sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities; higher mortality risk than sepsis alone.

## Multifactorial Response
- Influenced by:
  - **Host Factors**: Genetics, age, co-morbidities.
  - **Pathogen Factors**: Type, virulence, burden.
  - **Environmental Factors**.

## Common Infection Sites
- Respiratory tract
- Gastrointestinal tract
- Renal tract
- Genitourinary tract

## Risk Factors
- Extremes of age 
- Frail individuals
- Immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals
- Recent trauma or surgery
- Breach in skin integrity
- Pregnant, post-partum women, or those with recent pregnancy terminations/miscarriages

## Incidence and Outcomes
- Increasing incidence of sepsis.
- Potential decrease in case fatality rate due to better recognition and reporting.

## Complications
- Organ failure
- Recurrent or secondary infections
- Death

## Suspected Sepsis Indicators
- Symptoms/signs of possible infection causing significant illness or deterioration (e.g., malaise, agitation).
- One or more risk factors for sepsis in an unwell appearance.
- Concern from relatives or caregivers about changes in appearance/behavior.

## Urgent Assessment
- Evaluate physiological symptoms to identify severe illness or death risk.
- Use sepsis risk stratification tool for clinical deterioration assessment.

## Management Strategies
- **High Risk**: 
  - Emergency transfer to hospital (via 999 ambulance).
- **Primary Care Management**:
  - For high-risk individuals where hospital transfer is burdensome.
  - Manage underlying conditions with follow-up care if moderate-to-high risk criteria are met.
  - Low-risk management with safety-netting information.

## Post-Hospital Discharge Management
- Advice on sepsis nature, recovery expectations, and support resources.
- Assess/manage complications post-sepsis (e.g., anxiety, PTSD, fatigue, chronic pain).
