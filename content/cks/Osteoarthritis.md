## Osteoarthritis Summary

### Definition
- Long-term disorder of synovial joints.
- Triggered by damage leading to repair processes and structural changes.
- Features include:
  - Localized cartilage loss
  - Bone remodeling
  - Osteophyte formation
  - Mild synovitis

### Symptoms
- Pain
- Stiffness
- Loss of function
- "Flare" of OA: 
  - Sudden increase in symptoms lasting 24 hours or more.
  - Typically lasts 3â€“8 days.

### Prevalence
- Varies by:
  - Joint(s) affected
  - Age
  - Sex
  - Socio-economic group
  - Comorbidities

### Etiology
- Complex and multifactorial:
  - Genetic
  - Biological (age, obesity)
  - Biomechanical (joint injury)

### Diagnosis Criteria
- Suspected in individuals aged 45+ with:
  - Activity-related joint pain
  - No joint stiffness or stiffness lasting <30 minutes
  - Possible functional limitation

#### Examination Findings
- Bony swelling
- Joint deformity
- Restricted/painful range of motion
- Mild synovitis or joint effusion
- Crepitus
- Joint instability

### Assessment
- Investigate:
  - Location, duration, onset, severity, and pattern of symptoms
  - Risk factors and comorbidities
  - Atypical features
  - Functional limitation
  - Psychosocial impact
  - Treatments tried
  - Family history and social support
- Physical examination:
  - Typical features of OA
  - Posture, gait, and BMI
  - Atypical features and other pain sources
- Consider joint X-ray for:
  - Diagnostic uncertainty
  - Atypical features
  - Sudden worsening of symptoms

### Management
- Advise on:
  - Information and support sources
  - Self-care strategies (weight management, footwear)
  - Individualized therapeutic exercise (muscle strengthening, aerobic fitness)
  - Simple analgesia for symptom relief
- Provide psychosocial support:
  - Social care
  - Social prescribing
  - Occupational health
- Follow-up in primary care to assess treatment response.
- Referral options:
  - Local musculoskeletal multidisciplinary team (manual therapy, assistive aids, corticosteroid injections, structured treatment packages)
  - Orthopaedic surgeon (if non-surgical management fails after 3 months, or if there is diagnostic uncertainty or sudden worsening)
  - Pain management service and/or specialist mental health service if needed.
