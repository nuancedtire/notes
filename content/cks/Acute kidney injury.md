## Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Summary

### Definition
- AKI is a spectrum of kidney injury characterized by a sudden decline in renal function over hours or days, impacting fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance.

### Diagnosis and Staging
- Based on:
  - Changes in serum creatinine
  - Reduction in urine output (oliguria)

### Causes of AKI
1. **Pre-renal**: Reduced kidney perfusion/hypotension
2. **Intra-renal**: Structural damage to the kidney
3. **Post-renal**: Acute urinary tract obstruction

### Increased Risk Factors
- Age 65 or older
- History of AKI or urological obstruction
- Chronic kidney disease (CKD), heart failure, liver disease, diabetes mellitus
- Reliance on others for fluid intake
- Conditions such as sepsis, hypovolaemia, hypotension, dehydration, oliguria
- Use of specific medications

### Complications
- Severity and duration-related complications include:
  - Hyperkalaemia
  - Metabolic acidosis
  - Fluid overload
  - Uraemia
  - CKD

### When to Suspect AKI
- Acute illness (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting)
- Acute illness with risk factors for AKI
- Illness with CKD or urological disease, or AKI complications
- Warning stage laboratory test results (creatinine change)

### Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnosis may be established by:
- Rise in serum creatinine of 26 micromol/L or greater within 48 hours
- 50% or greater rise in serum creatinine within the past 7 days
- Urine output < 0.5 mL/kg/hour for > 6 hours

### Assessment
- Current symptoms, fluid intake, urine output, comorbidities, medications, social situation
- Volume status and signs of urological obstruction
- Renal function and serum potassium level checks
- Urine dipstick analysis for underlying causes

### Management
- **Urgent actions**:
  - Hospital admission or same-day referral for stage 3 AKI or severe complications
  - Nephrology consultation for stage 4/5 CKD, renal transplant history, or specialist needs
- **Treatment**:
  - Address underlying causes
  - Advise on fluid balance
  - Modify medications as necessary
  - Regular serum creatinine monitoring in primary care

### Follow-Up
- Document AKI episode
- Consider nephrology referral for CKD
- Regular renal function monitoring for CKD development/progression
- Review medications temporarily stopped/reduced
- Provide information and support resources
- Advise on prevention measures for future AKI episodes
