- **Definition**: 
  - Aphthous ulcers are painful, round or ovoid, shallow ulcers in the mouth, not linked to systemic disease.
  - Typically recurrent, often starting in childhood.

- **Causes**: 
  - Single or recurrent ulcers may result from:
    - Oral trauma (e.g., biting cheeks, toothbrush injury, sharp tooth or filling).
    - Possible genetic predisposition.

- **Precipitating Factors**:
  - Oral trauma
  - Anxiety or stress
  - Certain foods (chocolate, coffee, peanuts, gluten-containing products)
  - Vitamin and mineral deficiencies
  - Stopping smoking
  - Hormonal changes (menstrual cycle)

- **Investigations**:
  - Generally unnecessary.
  - Full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ferritin, folate, and vitamin B12 tests if systemic disease is suspected.

- **Healing**: 
  - Most ulcers heal within 10â€“14 days without scarring.

- **Management**:
  - Avoid precipitating factors.
  - Symptomatic treatments:
    - Short course of low potency topical corticosteroids
    - Antimicrobial mouthwash
    - Topical analgesics

- **Referral**:
  - Urgent referral for biopsy if a single ulcer persists for more than 3 weeks to rule out malignancy.
