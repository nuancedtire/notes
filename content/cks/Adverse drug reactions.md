## Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) Summary

### Definition
- **Adverse Drug Reaction (ADR)**: A noxious and unintended response to a medicinal product with a known or strongly suspected causal relationship.

### Causes of ADRs
- Occur from:
  - Off-label therapeutic use
  - Overdose
  - Misuse or abuse
  - Medication errors
  - Occupational exposure

### Types of ADRs
1. **Type A (Pharmacological/Augmented)**
   - Result from an exaggeration of the drugâ€™s normal effects at therapeutic doses.
   - Dose dependent and reversible by dose reduction or treatment withdrawal.
   - Accounts for >80% of ADRs.
  
2. **Type B (Idiosyncratic/Bizarre)**
   - Cannot be predicted from the drug's known pharmacology.
   - Less common than Type A reactions.

### Implications of ADRs
- Health and financial impacts are significant.
- 6-7% of hospital admissions in the UK are due to ADRs.

### Assessment of Suspected ADRs
1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Evaluate the nature and severity of the reaction.
   - Take a history of the presenting condition.
   - Review the full drug history and any allergy or previous ADRs.
   - Examine the drug's adverse effect profile.
   - Consider the need for further examinations.

2. **Follow-Up Actions**
   - Arrange emergency admission for serious or life-threatening ADRs.
   - Assess if the ADR can be managed in primary care.
   - Seek specialist advice if necessary.
   - Discuss treatment options if manageable in primary care.
