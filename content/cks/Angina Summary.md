## [[Angina]]: Quick Revision Notes

- **Definition**: [[Angina]] is [[chest pain]] or discomfort due to insufficient blood supply to the myocardium.
- **Causes**:
  - **Common**: Coronary artery disease.
  - **Less Common**: 
    - Valvular disease (e.g., aortic stenosis)
    - Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
    - Hypertensive heart disease

- **Types of [[Angina]]**:
  - **Stable [[Angina]]**:
    - Predictable with physical exertion or emotional stress.
    - Relieved within minutes by rest or sublingual glyceryl trinitrate.
  - **Unstable Angina**:
    - New onset (within 24 hours) or abrupt deterioration of stable [[angina]].
    - Often occurs at rest.
    - Requires immediate hospital admission or referral.

- **Management of Stable [[Angina]]**:
  - **Lifestyle Advice**:
    - Smoking cessation support.
    - Cardioprotective diet encouragement.
    - Weight management support.
    - Increased physical activity within symptom limits.
    - Alcohol consumption limitation.
    
  - **Medications**:
    - **Rapid Relief**: Sublingual glyceryl trinitrate (GTN).
    - **First-line Treatment**: Beta-blocker or calcium-channel blocker.
    - **Second-line Treatment**: Long-acting nitrate (e.g., isosorbide mononitrate), nicorandil, ivabradine, ranolazine.
    - If control is poor on maximum doses, switch to or add another drug class.
    - Referral to a cardiologist if control is poor on two drugs; consider starting a third anti-anginal drug while waiting.

- **Secondary Prevention of Cardiovascular Events**:
  - **Antiplatelet Treatment**: Low-dose aspirin (75 mg daily) for most patients.
  - **ACE Inhibitors**: Prescribe for patients with:
    - Coexisting hypertension
    - Heart failure
    - Asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction
    - Chronic kidney disease
    - Previous myocardial infarction
    - Consider for patients with diabetes mellitus.
  - **Lipid Modification Treatment**: Offer when appropriate.
  - **Hypertension Treatment**: Offer when clinically appropriate.

- **Hospital Admission Criteria for Possible Unstable Angina**:
  - Pain at rest (possibly at night).
  - Pain on minimal exertion.
  - Rapidly progressing angina despite increasing medical treatment.
