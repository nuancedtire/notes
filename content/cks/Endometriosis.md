## Endometriosis: Quick Revision Guide

### Definition
- **Endometriosis:** Growth of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus.

### Common Locations
- Pelvis: ovaries, peritoneum, uterosacral ligaments, pouch of Douglas.
- Rare locations: bowel, pleural cavity (extrapelvic deposits).

### Association
- Linked to menstruation; hormonal changes cause:
  - Bleeding
  - Chronic inflammation
  - Scar tissue formation

### Causes
- Unknown; thought to involve:
  - Retrograde menstruation
  - Personal genetics
  - Metaplasia
  - Environmental factors

### Prevalence
- Common gynecological disorder: affects about 1 in 10 women of reproductive age in the UK.
- Can be chronic throughout reproductive life and beyond.

### Symptoms
- **Suspected in women presenting with:**
  - Chronic pelvic pain (6 months minimum)
  - Dysmenorrhea affecting daily activities
  - Deep pain during/after intercourse
  - Painful bowel movements
  - Urinary symptoms (blood in urine or pain)
  - Infertility associated with above symptoms

### Assessment
- **History & Examination:**
  - Identify risk factors (e.g., early menarche, nulliparity, family history).
  - Exclude differential diagnoses (e.g., IBS, pelvic inflammatory disease).
  - Identify complications (e.g., fertility issues, depression).
- **Normal exam does not exclude endometriosis.** 
- **Consider referral for further assessment if suspicion remains.**

### Diagnosis
- Definitive diagnosis: laparoscopic visualization of the pelvis.
- Other methods (e.g., ultrasound) can assist diagnosis.

### Management
- **Pain Management:**
  - Simple analgesics (paracetamol, NSAIDs)
  - Hormonal treatments (combined oral contraceptive pill, progestogen)
- **Individualized Care:**
  - Assess personal needs: circumstances, symptoms, fertility desires, daily living, cultural background, emotional needs.
  - Manage complications (e.g., fertility issues, depression).
- **Review:**
  - Regular follow-ups for ongoing support.

### Referral Criteria
- Consider referral to secondary care for:
  - Severe, persistent, or recurrent symptoms.
  - Pelvic signs of endometriosis.
  - Ineffective or intolerable initial management (for other options, including laparoscopy).
