- **Definition**: Hyponatraemia is a serum sodium concentration of less than 135 mmol/L.

- **Prevalence**: Most common electrolyte disorder; often an incidental finding in routine blood tests.

- **Severity Classification**:
  - Mild: 130–135 mmol/L
  - Moderate: 125–129 mmol/L
  - Severe: < 125 mmol/L

- **Rate of Onset**:
  - Acute: < 48 hours
  - Chronic: ≥ 48 hours

- **Common Causes**:
  - Medications (especially thiazide diuretics)
  - Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIADH)
  - Underlying medical conditions (e.g., heart failure, kidney disease, liver disease)

- **Symptoms**:
  - Often asymptomatic, especially in mild and gradually developed cases.
  - Non-specific symptoms related to severity and rate of onset.
  - Severe/rapid changes: vomiting, headache, drowsiness, seizures, coma, cardio-respiratory arrest.
  - Chronic hyponatraemia: increased risk of falls, bone fractures, osteoporosis, gait instability, cognitive deficits.

- **Assessment**:
  - Focused history
  - Determine volume status
  - Investigations: serum and urine osmolality, urinary sodium concentration
  - Repeat serum sodium measurement to monitor for rapid decreases.

- **Management**:
  - **Severe/Symptomatic Hyponatraemia**: Hospital admission for urgent treatment.
  - **Asymptomatic Moderate Hyponatraemia**: Seek specialist endocrinologist advice for potential admission/referral.
  - **Asymptomatic Mild Hyponatraemia**: Investigate underlying causes in primary care.
  - **Acute Illness**: Treat the illness, recheck serum sodium after 2 weeks.
  - **Medication Review**: Stop contributing medications if appropriate; recheck serum sodium after 2 weeks.
