- **Types of Combined Hormonal Contraceptives (CHCs)**:
  - Oral contraceptives
  - Transdermal patch
  - Vaginal ring

- **Mechanism of Action**:
  - Inhibit ovulation by affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.
  - Reduce production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).
  - Prevents ovulation due to lack of LH and FSH surge.

- **Effects on Cervical Mucus and Endometrium**:
  - Oestrogen:
    - Causes endometrium to proliferate and grow.
  - Progestogen:
    - Opposes oestrogen's proliferative effects, preventing hyperplasia.
    
- **Hormone-Free Interval**:
  - Usual 7-day interval allows oestrogen and progestogen levels to fall.
  - Mimics menstruation by sloughing off the endometrium.
  - No health benefit from hormone-free interval; women can skip or reduce it (off-label use).

- **Efficacy**:
  - Perfect use: 0.3% pregnancy rate within the first year.
  - Typical use: 9% pregnancy rate within the first year.
