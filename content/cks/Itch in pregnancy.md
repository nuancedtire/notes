- **Itch in Pregnancy Overview**
  - May be due to pre-existing or pregnancy-specific conditions.
  - Occurs in about 1 in 5 pregnant women.

- **Common Pregnancy-Related Causes of Itch**
  1. **Obstetric Cholestasis**
     - No rash.
     - Severe itch, often starting abruptly in the third trimester.
     - More noticeable on soles and palms; can occur anywhere.
     - Symptoms may worsen at night.
     - Generally poses no risk to the woman; slightly increased risk of stillbirth.
     - Symptoms typically resolve after delivery.
     - Refer suspected cases for same-day obstetric investigation.

  2. **Polymorphic Eruption of Pregnancy**
     - Usually occurs in the third trimester.
     - More common in first pregnancies and multiple pregnancies.
     - Rash: intensely itchy pruritic urticarial papules that form plaques.
     - Starts on the abdomen (umbilicus usually spared); can become widespread.
     - No serious risk to woman or baby; symptoms last 4â€“6 weeks, resolving post-delivery.
     - Treatment: emollients, moderately potent topical corticosteroids, sedating antihistamines.

  3. **Atopic Eruption of Pregnancy**
     - Commonly presents in the first trimester.
     - More likely in women with a history of atopic eczema.
     - Rash: itchy eczematous, papular lesions.
     - No serious risk to woman; potential increased risk of child developing atopic eczema.
     - Treatment: emollients, moderately potent topical corticosteroids, sedating antihistamines.

  4. **Pemphigoid Gestationis**
     - Very rare.
     - Intense itch precedes rash; starts with urticarial papules and plaques on the abdomen (often affects umbilicus).
     - May spread and form tense blisters.
     - Associated with preterm birth and small for gestational age infants.
     - Symptoms regress after delivery; possible 10% chance of mild transient skin lesions in neonate.
     - Refer for additional antenatal surveillance and dermatology treatment (topical/systemic corticosteroids).
