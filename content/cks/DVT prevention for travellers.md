- **Definition**: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of a thrombus in a deep vein, obstructing blood flow.

- **Cause**: Travel-related DVT is often due to prolonged immobility during long-distance travel, affected by:
  - Venous stasis from cramped sitting
  - Seat-edge pressure
  - Coagulation activation
  - Individual risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE)

- **Incidence**: 
  - Annual incidence: ~1 in 1000
  - Increased risk: 2 to 4 times higher after flights >4 hours; similar risk for cars, trains, etc.
  
- **Clot Characteristics**:
  - Most clots are small and asymptomatic.
  
- **Travel Duration**: 
  - Risk increases with longer travel and multiple flights in a short time.
  - Estimated risk for healthy individuals: 1 in 4656 to 6000 flights >4 hours.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Active malignancy
  - Family history of DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE)
  - Chronic venous insufficiency
  - Extremes of height (taller than 1.90 m or shorter than 1.60 m)
  - Blood-clotting abnormalities (inherited or acquired)
  - Limited mobility (e.g., fractures, paralysis)
  - Obesity
  - Older age (risk increases after 40)
  - Pregnancy or within 6 weeks postpartum
  - Previous DVT or PE
  - Recent surgery/trauma (abdomen, pelvis, legs)
  - Use of oestrogens (oral contraceptives, hormone replacement)

- **Risk Assessment**: 
  - Evaluate planned travel duration and pre-existing risk factors.
  
- **High-Risk Individuals**:
  - Active malignancy
  - Recent childbirth (within 6 weeks)
  - Previous VTE (unprovoked or travel-related)
  - Significant immobility
  - Recent major surgery (within 4 weeks)
  - Multiple risk factors (e.g., pregnancy, hormonal treatment, BMI ≥30 kg/m²)

- **Preventive Measures**:
  - Advise all travellers on long journeys to reduce immobility.
  - High-risk individuals should consider:
    - Postponing travel
    - If essential, consider low molecular weight heparin and/or graded compression stockings.
