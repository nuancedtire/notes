- **Vitamin D Overview**
  - Fat-soluble vitamin crucial for calcium and phosphate homeostasis.
  - Vital for musculoskeletal health.
  - Circulates as:
    - Vitamin D3 (colecalciferol)
    - Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)

- **Sources of Vitamin D in the UK**
  - 80–90% from sunlight (UVB radiation).
  - 10–20% from dietary sources.

- **Vitamin D Thresholds for Bone Health (UK)**
  - **Deficiency Risk**: Serum 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/L.
  - **Inadequate Levels**: Serum 25(OH)D 25–50 nmol/L.
  - **Sufficient Levels**: Serum 25(OH)D > 50 nmol/L.

- **Risk Factors for Deficiency**
  - Age 65 and over.
  - Low/no sun exposure (e.g., skin covering, housebound).
  - Dark skin pigmentation.
  - Malabsorption disorders or post-weight loss surgery.
  - Severe liver or end-stage chronic kidney disease.
  - Certain medications.
  - Pregnant or breastfeeding.
  - Obesity.

- **Complications of Deficiency**
  - Osteomalacia (symptoms: lower back pain, bone pain, muscle pain, waddling gait).
  - Osteoporosis.
  - Increased risk of falls and fragility fractures.

- **Assessment for Deficiency**
  - Check serum 25(OH)D if:
    - Musculoskeletal symptoms may indicate deficiency.
    - Suspected bone disease (e.g., osteomalacia, osteoporosis).
    - Known bone disease needing vitamin D correction.

- **Management of Deficiency**
  - Seek specialist advice for:
    - Hypercalcaemia conditions.
    - Malabsorption disorders.
    - Renal stone disease.
    - Severe kidney/liver disease.
    - Pregnancy.
  - Provide information and support.
  - Advise on safe sunlight exposure and dietary sources.
  - Prescribe loading dose followed by maintenance therapy for rapid treatment.
  - Prescribe maintenance therapy for less urgent cases.
  - Assess dietary calcium intake and supplement if needed.
  - Arrange follow-up for serum calcium and vitamin D levels.

- **Prevention of Deficiency**
  - Educate on safe sunlight exposure and dietary sources.
  - Adults with risk factors: daily supplement of 400 IU vitamin D year-round.
  - Other adults: consider daily 400 IU supplement, especially in autumn and winter.
