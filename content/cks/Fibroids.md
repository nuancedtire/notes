## Fibroids: Summary

### Definition
- Uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign tumors formed by the proliferation of smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts in the myometrium.

### Characteristics
- Can be single or multiple, variable in size.
- Development locations: subserosal, intramural, or submucosal.
- Common in women of reproductive age; regress post-menopause.
- Typically asymptomatic; often discovered incidentally.

### Risk Factors
- Increasing age (until menopause)
- Early menarche
- Older age at first pregnancy
- Comorbidities: obesity, hypertension
- Ethnicity: black and Asian
- Family history

### Complications
- Iron deficiency anemia (heavy menstrual bleeding)
- Bladder and bowel compressive symptoms (especially with large fibroids)
- Subfertility or infertility
- Obstetric complications
- Torsion (of a pedunculated fibroid)

### Clinical Features

#### History-Taking
- Heavy menstrual bleeding and/or dysmenorrhea
- Pelvic pain, pressure, discomfort; dyspareunia
- Abdominal discomfort or bloating; back pain
- Urinary symptoms: frequency, urgency, incontinence, retention, UTIs
- Bowel symptoms: bloating, constipation, painful defecation
- Subfertility or infertility (especially with submucosal fibroids)

#### Examination Findings
- Firm, enlarged, irregularly shaped non-tender uterus on pelvic exam
- Central irregular abdominal mass (if large fibroid)

### Assessment
- Discuss symptoms: severity, duration, daily impact, quality of life; previous fertility issues; risk factors; previous treatments.
- Conduct abdominal and bimanual pelvic exam for tenderness and masses.
- Arrange pelvic ultrasound to determine number, size, and location of fibroids.
- Full blood count to check for iron deficiency anemia if heavy bleeding is present.

### Management
- Urgent referral for suspected malignancy based on clinical or radiological features.
- Referral for uncertain diagnosis; severe/refractory symptoms; fibroids â‰¥3 cm; suspected fertility/obstetric issues; rapid growth post-menopause.
- Provide information and support resources.
- Manage heavy menstrual bleeding and other symptoms in primary care as appropriate.
- Reassure that treatment is not routinely needed for asymptomatic fibroids.
- Advise on contraception and menopausal symptom management as needed.
