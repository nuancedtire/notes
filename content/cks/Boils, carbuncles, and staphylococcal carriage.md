- **Boils and Carbuncles**
  - **Boil**: Deep inflammatory nodule with purulent material from a hair follicle.
  - **Carbuncle**: Group of adjacent boils that form an inflammatory mass draining through multiple follicular orifices.

- **Causes**
  - Mainly caused by *Staphylococcus aureus*, including:
    - Methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA)
    - Panton-Valentine leukocidin *S. aureus* (PVL-SA)

- **Complications**
  - Scarring
  - Spread of infection (e.g., cellulitis)
  - Rarely, sepsis

- **Management**
  - **Urgent Treatment**:
    - Same-day incision and drainage for carbuncles and large/fluctuant boils.
  - **Small Boils**:
    - Typically drain spontaneously with moist heat application.

- **Admission for IV Antibiotics Consideration**:
  - Systemically unwell patients.
  - Patients with cellulitis.
  - Infections in serious complication areas (e.g., face).
  - Immunocompromised individuals.

- **Non-admission Care**:
  - Apply moist heat 3â€“4 times daily to relieve pain and promote drainage.
  - Seek medical advice if:
    - Lesion becomes fluctuant.
    - Systemically unwell.

- **Antibiotics**:
  - First-line: Flucloxacillin.
  - Alternatives for penicillin allergy: Erythromycin, Clarithromycin.
  - Prescribe if:
    - Cellulitis, fever, facial lesion, severe pain, or comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, immunosuppression).

- **Self-Care Advice**:
  - For recurrent cases:
    - Swab the lesion.
    - Treat with appropriate antibiotics for 7 days.
    - Mention suspected PVL-SA on laboratory forms.

- **Staphylococcal Carriage**:
  - Asymptomatic *S. aureus* on skin or mucous membranes, commonly in the nose.
  - Risk factor for recurrent boils/carbuncles.
  - Swabs for testing recommended if recurrent boils are facial; for extensive cases, additional swabs from perineum, groin, axilla, and umbilicus.

- **Treatment for Staphylococcal Carriage**:
  - Prescribe nasal decolonization treatment and skin care.
  - Do not start decolonization until acute infection resolves.

- **Recurrent Infections Management**:
  - Consider extended swabbing for other carriage sites.
  - Request PVL-SA testing specifically.
  - Identify and treat potential infection sources in family/close contacts.
