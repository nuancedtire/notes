## Fungal Skin Infection - Scalp: Summary

### Definition
- **Tinea capitis** (scalp ringworm): Infection of scalp hair follicles and surrounding skin caused by dermatophytes.

### Causative Agents
- **Urban UK**: Primarily caused by **Trichophyton tonsurans**.
- **Rural UK & Europe**: Mainly caused by **Microsporum canis**.

### Population Affected
- Predominantly affects **prepubertal Afro-Caribbean children**.

### Clinical Features
- **Symptoms may vary** based on inflammatory response:
  - Scaling and itch of the scalp
  - Patches of hair loss
  - Skin erythema, pustules, crusting, lymphadenopathy
  - Painful, pustular boggy masses (kerion)
  - Associated fungal infections at other sites

### Assessment
- **Skin and hair sampling** for fungal microscopy and culture to confirm diagnosis and identify the cause.

### Management
- **Self-care advice**:
  - Remove surface crusts
  - Discard/disinfect potential infection-transmitting objects
  - Inspect family members/pets for signs of infection

- **Oral antifungal treatment**:
  - **Adults**: Start treatment based on clinical judgment before or after culture results.
  - **Children**: Start treatment if diagnosis is confirmed and there is prescribing experience; seek specialist advice if unsure.
  - Co-prescribe a **topical antifungal** to reduce transmission risk.

- **Review**: Schedule assessment 4–8 weeks after completing antifungal therapy to evaluate treatment response.

### Treatment Protocols
- **Primary care medications**:
  - **Oral griseofulvin** (licensed) or **oral terbinafine** (off-label) should be prescribed empirically.
  - **Urban areas**: Start and continue terbinafine if T. tonsurans is suspected.
  - **Rural areas**: Start and continue griseofulvin if Microsporum species is suspected.
  - **Oral itraconazole** (off-label) may be considered if griseofulvin is not tolerated.

### Signs of Treatment Failure
- Repeat skin and hair sampling for fungal microscopy and culture.
- Continue first-line oral antifungal therapy for an additional 2–4 weeks if clinical improvement is noted but mycology remains positive.

### Referral Criteria
- Urgent referral for suspected **kerion**.
- Insufficient experience in primary care for oral antifungal treatment in children.
- Uncertain diagnosis or unsuccessful treatment in primary care.
- Suspected complications not responding to primary care treatment.

### Known Contacts
- Arrange **skin and hair sampling** for fungal culture to determine if contact has confirmed infection or is an asymptomatic carrier.
