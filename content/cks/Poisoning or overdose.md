### Definitions
- **Poisoning**: State resulting from excessive amounts of any pharmaceutical agent (drugs, household products, industrial chemicals, plant/animal derivatives). Can be accidental or deliberate.
- **Overdose**: Use of a drug quantity exceeding the intended or prescribed dose. Can also be accidental or deliberate, involving prescribed or illicit drugs.

### Statistics
- In the UK, paracetamol is the most commonly used medication in deliberate overdose cases.
- Approximately 160,000 people are admitted to hospitals in the UK each year with suspected poisoning.

### Prognosis
- Depends on:
  - Type of poison
  - Quantity taken
  - Associated comorbidities

### Initial Assessment
1. **Overall Status**:
   - Rapid assessment of airways
   - Level of consciousness
   - Respiratory rate
   - Pulse, blood pressure, and temperature
2. **Examination**:
   - General observations
   - Neurological examination
   - Signs consistent with the substance(s) taken
3. **If Deliberate Self-Poisoning**:
   - Assess emotional and mental state
   - Risk of psychological harm and further self-harm or suicide
   - Safeguarding concerns

### Emergency Transfer to Hospital
Arrange if:
- Seizure occurred
- Unconscious or reduced level of consciousness
- Reduced respiratory rate or oxygen saturation
- Hypotension
- Tachycardia, bradycardia, or irregular pulse
- Hypothermia or hyperthermia
- Other concerning clinical features are present or deterioration occurs

### History Taking (if emergency transfer not required)
- Details of the substance taken
- Relevant personal and medical details
- Symptoms experienced

### Urgent Hospital Referral Needed
- All who have deliberately self-poisoned
- Symptomatic individuals
- Those who have taken poisons with delayed action
- Unknown type of poison

### Refusal of Hospital Admission
- Determine reasons for refusal and inform about potential consequences.
- If refusal persists and it's in their best interest, assess capacity and consider compulsory admission under the Mental Health Act.
- Refer for urgent hospital admission or mental health assessment if diminished capacity and/or significant mental health disorder is present.

### Emergency Situations
- Assess capacity; urgent treatment is usually in the person's best interests.

### Admission Guidelines
- Hospital admission is generally not indicated for accidental poisoning with low toxicity agents.
- No hospital assessment usually required for accidental additional doses of personal medication.
