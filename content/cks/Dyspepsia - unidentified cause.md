## Dyspepsia - Unidentified Cause: Summary

### Definition
- **Dyspepsia**: Complex of upper gastrointestinal symptoms lasting 4+ weeks, including:
  - Upper abdominal pain/discomfort
  - Heartburn
  - Acid reflux
  - Nausea and/or vomiting

### Classification
- **Uninvestigated Dyspepsia**: Symptoms without prior endoscopy.
- **Common Causes**:
  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
  - Peptic ulcer disease (gastric/duodenal ulcers)
  - Functional dyspepsia (non-ulcer dyspepsia)

### Prevalence
- Dyspepsia symptoms occur in approximately 40% of the population annually.

### Assessment
- **Key Considerations**:
  - Identify alarm symptoms indicating serious pathology.
  - Explore lifestyle factors and mental health (stress, anxiety, depression).
  - Review medications (e.g., NSAIDs) that may worsen symptoms.
  - Consider differential diagnoses.
  - Conduct a full blood count to check for anemia or raised platelet count.

### Initial Management
- **Approaches**:
  - Advise on lifestyle modifications.
  - Manage associated stress, anxiety, or depression.
  - Reduce or stop medications that may exacerbate dyspepsia.
  - If symptoms persist, prescribe a full-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) for 1 month or test for Helicobacter pylori infection.

### Testing for H. pylori
- Preferred tests:
  - Carbon-13 urea breath test
  - Stool antigen test
- Important: No PPI for 2 weeks, no antibiotics for 4 weeks before testing.

### Treatment for H. pylori
- If positive, offer first-line eradication therapy.
- If symptoms persist/recur:
  - Consider alternative acid suppression with H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA).
  - Long-term acid suppression therapy if previous response was good.
  - H. pylori re-testing is not routine but may be warranted in some cases.
  - If re-testing is positive, offer second-line eradication therapy.

### Long-term Management
- Patients on long-term treatment for uninvestigated dyspepsia should:
  - Receive annual reviews.
  - Be encouraged to step down or stop treatment when appropriate.
  - Consider referral for endoscopy or gastroenterologist if:
    - Symptoms are refractory or recurrent despite optimal primary care management.
    - Second-line H. pylori eradication has failed.
    - Limited antibiotic options are available for H. pylori treatment.
