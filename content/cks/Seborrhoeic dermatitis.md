## Seborrhoeic Dermatitis Summary

### Overview
- Common inflammatory skin condition in sebaceous gland-rich areas (scalp, nasolabial folds, eyebrows, chest).
- In infants, primarily affects the scalp ("cradle cap").
- Presentation: Erythematous patches with greasy yellowish scales.

### Causes
- Exact cause not fully understood.
- Associated factors: Malassezia yeasts, host immune response.

### Course
- Infantile seborrhoeic dermatitis: Self-limiting, resolves around 8-12 months.
- Adult seborrhoeic dermatitis: Chronic, fluctuating symptoms, responds well to treatment but may relapse.

### Diagnosis
- Usually clinical.
- Investigations (blood tests, skin scrapings, biopsy) if underlying cause (e.g., HIV) or alternative diagnosis (e.g., tinea, lupus) suspected.

### Management in Infants
- **Scalp**: 
  - Massage topical emollient to loosen scales; remove with infant brush.
  - Daily bathing with emollient as soap substitute to moisturize skin.
  - Consider topical imidazole cream or low-potency corticosteroid if appropriate.

### Management in Adults
- **Scalp and Beard**:
  - Offer ketoconazole 2% shampoo or over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoo (e.g., coal tar, salicylic acid).
  - Consider short course of topical corticosteroid (e.g., betamethasone valerate 0.1%) for itching and inflammation.

- **Face and Body**:
  - Offer ketoconazole 2% cream (adults only) or other topical imidazoles (clotrimazole, miconazole).
  - Antifungal shampoo (e.g., ketoconazole 2%) as body wash if appropriate.
  - Consider short course of low to medium potency topical corticosteroid (e.g., hydrocortisone 1%) for flares.

### Referral to Dermatologist
Refer if:
- Diagnostic uncertainty.
- Failure to respond to routine treatment.
- Severe or widespread seborrhoeic dermatitis.
- Eyelid involvement (if eyelid hygiene measures unsuccessful).
