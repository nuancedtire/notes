## Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) - Children: Summary

- **Definition**: UTI is an illness caused by microorganisms in the urinary tract, primarily bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract.
- **Common Organisms**:
  - *Escherichia coli* (85% or more of cases)
  - *Klebsiella* species
  - *Staphylococcus saprophyticus*

- **Prevalence**:
  - 1 in 10 girls and 1 in 30 boys will have had a UTI by age 16.
  
- **Prognosis**:
  - Generally good; however, renal dysfunction may progress in those with urinary tract comorbidity.
  - Possible complications include renal scarring and hypertension.

- **Symptoms & Diagnosis**:
  - **Under 3 months**: Suspect UTI with fever, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, poor feeding, or failure to thrive.
  - **3 months and over**: Suspect UTI with fever, frequency, dysuria, abdominal pain, vomiting, poor feeding, dysfunctional voiding, or changes to continence.

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Evaluate risk of serious illness; high-risk children should be referred urgently to secondary care.

- **Management**:
  - **Under 3 months**: Urgent referral to a pediatric specialist for parenteral antibiotics; send urine for microscopy and culture.
  - **3 months and over**: Perform dipstick analysis for suspected UTI.
    - **Positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite**: Start antibiotics.
    - **Negative leukocyte esterase and nitrite**: Do not start antibiotics; do not send urine for microscopy and culture.
    - **Positive leukocyte esterase and negative nitrite**: Send urine for culture; treat under 3 years with antibiotics; treat 3 years and over only if good clinical evidence exists.
    - **Negative leukocyte esterase and positive nitrite**: Start antibiotics (fresh sample) and send urine for culture.

- **[[Acute Pyelonephritis]]/Upper UTI**:
  - Diagnosed with fever ≥ 38°C and bacteriuria or fever < 38°C with loin pain/tenderness and bacteriuria.
  - For children 3 months and over: Consider referral to a pediatric specialist; start oral antibiotics (cefalexin or co-amoxiclav).

- **Cystitis/Lower UTI**:
  - For children 3 months and over: Start oral antibiotics (trimethoprim if low resistance risk; nitrofurantoin if eGFR ≥ 45 ml/min).
  - If not suitable: Use nitrofurantoin (if eGFR ≥ 45 ml/min) second line, or amoxicillin (if culture results are available and susceptible), or cefalexin.

- **Prophylaxis**:
  - Consider daily antibiotic prophylaxis for children over 3 months with recurrent UTI after treating current UTI, with specialist advice.
