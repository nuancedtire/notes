## Eczema - Atopic: Summary

### Overview
- **Definition**: Chronic, itchy, inflammatory skin condition.
- **Age of Onset**: Most common in childhood; 70-90% of cases before age 5, high incidence in the first year of life.
- **Nature**: Episodic with flares (2-3 times/month) and remissions; can be continuous in severe cases.

### Etiology
- **Factors Involved**:
  - Genetic predisposition
  - Skin barrier dysfunction
  - Environmental factors (pets, house-dust mites, pollen)
  - Immune system dysfunction

### Complications
- **Infections**:
  - Bacterial (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus)
  - Viral (e.g., herpes simplex)
  - Fungal
- **Psychosocial Issues**:
  - School absenteeism
  - Depression
  - Disturbed sleep
  - Reduced self-confidence

### Diagnosis
- **Method**: Primarily clinical; investigations not routinely necessary but may help exclude other conditions.
- **Assessment**: Severity of eczema and psychological impact evaluated at each consultation.

### Management
- **Stepped Approach**:
  1. **Emollients**: First-line treatment during flares and remissions.
  2. **Topical Steroids**: Consider for red, inflamed skin; use lowest potency necessary.
  3. **Antihistamines**:
     - Non-sedating for persistent, severe itch/urticaria (1-month trial).
     - Sedating for severe itching affecting sleep (short course).
  4. **Oral Corticosteroids**: Short course for severe, extensive eczema.
  5. **Antibiotics**: For weeping, crusted eczema with fever/malaise (consider secondary infection).

### Patient Education
- Provide information on eczema management, adherence to skin care, and avoidance of triggers.

### Urgent Situations
- **Immediate Hospital Admission**: If eczema herpeticum is suspected (rapidly worsening, painful eczema, clustered blisters, punched out erosions).

### Referrals
- **Dermatologist**: 
  - Uncertain diagnosis
  - Uncontrolled eczema
  - Recurrent secondary infections
  - High risk of complications
  - Need for treatment advice (e.g., bandaging techniques)
- **Immunologist/Pediatrician**: If food allergy trigger is suspected.
- **Clinical Psychologist**: For patients with controlled eczema but impaired quality of life and psychological well-being.
