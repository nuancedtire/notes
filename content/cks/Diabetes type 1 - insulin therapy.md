- **Insulin Overview**
  - Polypeptide hormone secreted by pancreatic beta cells.
  - Lowers blood glucose to prevent:
    - Hyperglycaemia
    - Microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy)
    - Macrovascular complications (myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease)
    - Metabolic complications (diabetic ketoacidosis, hypoglycaemia)

- **Type 1 Diabetes**
  - Autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells leads to absolute insulin deficiency.
  - Insulin therapy is essential.

- **Types of Insulin Available in the UK**
  1. **Human Insulins**
     - Produced via recombinant DNA technology.
     - Same amino acid sequence as endogenous insulin.
  2. **Human Insulin Analogues**
     - Modified for specific kinetic characteristics (extended duration, faster absorption).
  3. **Animal Insulins** (rarely used)
     - Extracted from animal sources (bovine or porcine).

- **Insulin Categorization by Time-Action Profiles**
  - **Rapid- and Short-Acting Insulins**
    - Quick onset and short duration.
    - Mimics insulin response to meals.
  - **Intermediate- and Long-Acting Insulins**
    - Slow onset and long duration.
    - Mimics basal insulin secretion.

- **Insulin Regimens**
  - Treatment should be individualized; options include:
    - Multiple daily injection (basal-bolus)
    - Mixed (biphasic) regimen (1-3 injections/day)
    - Continuous insulin infusion (pump therapy)

- **Adverse Effects of Insulin Therapy**
  - **Hypoglycaemia**
    - Defined as blood glucose < 3.5 mmol/L.
    - Symptoms: hunger, anxiety, irritability, palpitations, sweating, tingling lips, convulsions, loss of consciousness, coma.
  
- **Education and Management of Hypoglycaemia**
  - Patients should be educated on:
    - Awareness and management of hypoglycaemia.
    - Availability of fast-acting glucose sources.
  - Severe hypoglycaemia:
    - Recommended treatment: intramuscular glucagon administered by another person.

- **Professional Oversight**
  - Insulin treatment should be initiated and managed by trained healthcare professionals.
  - Primary healthcare professionals can support with:
    - Insulin administration (injection technique, site)
    - Lifestyle and cultural aspects (diet, exercise, alcohol, driving, travel, insurance, fasting, shift work)
