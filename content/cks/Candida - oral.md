- **Candida Overview**
  - Yeast-like fungus, part of normal human gastrointestinal flora.
  - Usually asymptomatic colonization.
  - Can cause infections if mucosal barriers are disrupted or defenses are lowered.
  - Infections range from superficial mucocutaneous to invasive disseminated diseases.

- **Common Cause**
  - Oral candidiasis primarily caused by *Candida albicans*.

- **Types of Oral Candidiasis**
  - Pseudomembranous candidiasis.
  - Denture stomatitis.
  - Chronic plaque-like candidiasis.

- **Risk Factors**
  - Comorbidities:
    - Diabetes mellitus.
    - Severe anemia.
    - Immunocompromise (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, HIV/AIDS).
  - Other factors:
    - Poor dental hygiene.
    - Local trauma.
    - Smoking.
    - Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics or corticosteroids.
    - Malnutrition.

- **Hospital Admission Criteria**
  - Widespread infection (e.g., esophageal candidiasis with swallowing pain).
  - Systemically unwell individuals.

- **Treatment Guidelines**
  - **Immunocompetent Patients:**
    - Topical antifungal for 14 days.
    - First-line: Miconazole oral gel (for children 4 months and older).
      - Risk of choking in infants and young children.
    - Alternative: Nystatin suspension (not for neonates) for 7â€“14 days.
  
  - **If Topical Treatment Fails or Severe Cases:**
    - Patients aged 16 years and older:
      - Oral fluconazole for at least 14 days.
      - Review response to treatment.
      - If unresolved, consider additional 7 days of fluconazole.
      - Monitor for hepatotoxicity if treatment > 21 days.
      - Swabbing for organism identification.
      - Seek specialist advice or referral as necessary.
    - Patients under 16 or contraindications for fluconazole:
      - Seek specialist advice.

- **Special Considerations**
  - Immunosuppressed patients or those with HIV may require more intensive treatment.
  
- **Referral Criteria**
  - Recurrent oral candidiasis.
  - Breakthrough infection during preventive treatment (possible candidal resistance).
  - Diagnostic uncertainty.
  - Chronic plaque-like candidiasis unresponsive to treatment (risk of malignancy).
