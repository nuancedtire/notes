## Allergic Rhinitis Summary

- **Definition**: Allergic rhinitis is an IgE-mediated inflammatory disorder of the nose, triggered by exposure to allergens, leading to symptoms such as:
  - Sneezing
  - Nasal itching
  - Rhinorrhea (runny nose)
  - Nasal congestion

- **Classification**:
  - **By Severity**:
    - Mild
    - Moderate to Severe
  - **By Duration**:
    - **Seasonal**: Symptoms occur at the same time each year (e.g., hay fever, caused by pollen).
    - **Perennial**: Symptoms occur year-round, often due to dust mites or animal dander.
    - **Intermittent**: Symptoms for <4 days/week or <4 consecutive weeks.
    - **Persistent**: Symptoms for >4 days/week and >4 consecutive weeks.
    - **Occupational**: Symptoms triggered by allergens in the work environment.

- **Prevalence**: Affects 23-30% of the population in Europe; commonly begins in childhood/adolescence.

- **Complications**:
  - Reduced quality of life
  - Impaired school and work performance
  - Disturbed sleep
  - Reduced concentration
  - Potential development of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal polyps

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Suspected if there are:
    - Classic symptoms following exposure to known allergens
    - Associated conditions (allergic conjunctivitis, asthma, eczema)
  - Assessment includes:
    - Symptom type, frequency, timing, persistence, location
    - Severity and impact of symptoms
    - Housing conditions, pets, occupation
    - Medication history
    - Family history of atopy
    - Examination for signs and underlying causes

- **Initial Management**:
  - Provide information and support resources
  - Consider saline nasal irrigation
  - Allergen avoidance techniques if known
  - Use of:
    - As-needed intranasal antihistamine or non-sedating oral antihistamine for mild, intermittent symptoms
    - Regular intranasal corticosteroids for moderate to severe persistent symptoms or ineffective initial treatment
  - Review after 2-4 weeks if symptoms persist

- **Management of Refractory Allergic Rhinitis**:
  - Offer combination intranasal antihistamine and corticosteroid spray
  - Possible add-on treatments:
    - Intranasal decongestant
    - Intranasal anticholinergic
    - Leukotriene receptor antagonist
  - Short course of oral corticosteroids for severe, uncontrolled symptoms affecting quality of life

- **Referral to Specialist**:
  - If red flag features suggest alternative or serious diagnosis
  - Persistent symptoms despite optimal primary care management
  - Consideration of allergen avoidance techniques requiring allergy testing
  - Interest in immunotherapy instead of long-term medication
  - Uncertain diagnosis needing allergy testing or further investigation
