- **Definition**:  
  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a permanent dilation of the abdominal aorta with a diameter over 1.5 times the expected size for the person's sex and body size.  
  - **Diagnosis threshold**: Diameter of 3.0 cm or greater.

- **Prevalence**:  
  - UK prevalence in the NHS AAA screening program: 1.34% (approx. 1 in 70 men aged 65 in England).  
  - Annual deaths (men aged 65+ in England and Wales): ~3000.

- **Risk Factors**:  
  - Male sex  
  - Increasing age  
  - Smoking  
  - Hypertension  
  - Positive family history  
  - Diabetes mellitus  
  - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

- **Screening Program**:  
  - Offered to all men at age 65.  
  - Coordinated by NHS England with 38 local screening services across England.  
  - Services include: invitation letters, screening and surveillance clinics, results letters, referrals to vascular networks.

- **Screening Test**:  
  - **Method**: Abdominal ultrasound scan.  
  - **Possible Results**:  
    - No aneurysm (diameter < 3.0 cm): no further scans needed.  
    - Small AAA (3.0 cm to 4.4 cm): under surveillance, repeat scan in 12 months.  
    - Medium AAA (4.5 cm to 5.4 cm): under surveillance, repeat scan in 3 months.  
    - Large AAA (5.5 cm or larger): referred to a vascular surgeon.  
  - **Duration**: 10 to 15 minutes; results provided at the appointment.

- **Role of Primary Care**:  
  - **For men aged 66+ who haven't been screened**:  
    - Inform about the NHS AAA screening program and self-referral options.  
    - Encourage self-referral if they have risk factors (COPD, vascular diseases, family history of AAA, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, smoking history).  
    - Provide information and resources on AAA and screening.  
  - **For men with an AAA**:  
    - Provide information on lifestyle modifications to slow growth.  
    - Review and prescribe medications as needed.  
    - Monitor blood pressure regularly if required.  
    - Supply an appropriate leaflet on AAA if not previously received.
