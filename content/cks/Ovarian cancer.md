## Ovarian Cancer Summary

- **Origin**: Arises from the ovary.
  
- **Types**:
  - **Epithelial Cancers** (90% of cases):
    - Serous (70â€“85% of cases)
    - Mucinous
    - Endometrioid
    - Clear cell
    - Transitional cell
    - Squamous
  - **Non-epithelial Cancers** (10% of cases):
    - Germ cell tumours
    - Sex cord/stromal cell tumours

- **Metastatic Tumours**: Can occur in the ovary, often from:
  - Endometrial cancer
  - Breast cancer
  - Gastrointestinal tract cancers

- **Spread**: 
  - Intraperitoneal structures/organs (causing intestinal obstruction and cachexia)
  - Liver
  - Para-aortic lymph nodes
  - Lungs (causing pleural effusions)

- **Lifetime Risk**: ~1 in 50 women will be diagnosed.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - **Increased Risk**:
    - Age
    - Family history (ovarian or breast cancer)
    - Gene mutations
    - Endometriosis
  - **Reduced Risk**:
    - Higher number of pregnancies
    - Breastfeeding
    - Use of the combined oral contraceptive pill

- **Symptoms to Monitor** (especially in women over 50):
  - Persistent abdominal distension (bloating)
  - Feeling full (early satiety) and/or loss of appetite
  - Pelvic or abdominal pain
  - Increased urinary urgency and/or frequency
  - Symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome (within the last 12 months)

- **Unexplained Symptoms**:
  - Weight loss
  - Malaise or fatigue
  - Change in bowel habit
  - Other symptoms:
    - Abnormal or postmenopausal bleeding
    - Gastrointestinal symptoms (dyspepsia, nausea, bowel obstruction)
    - Shortness of breath (due to pleural effusion)

- **Diagnosis**:
  - **Examination**: Abdomen and pelvis.
    - If ascites or pelvic/abdominal mass (not due to known uterine fibroids) is found, make an urgent referral.
    - If normal, measure serum CA125:
      - **If elevated**: Urgent pelvic ultrasound and referral if suggestive of ovarian cancer.
      - **If normal or elevated with normal ultrasound**: Consider other causes; advise return if symptoms worsen.
