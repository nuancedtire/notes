  - Unknown exact cause; believed to be immune-mediated.
  - Impaired epithelial barrier function and chronic inflammation.
  - Environmental triggers (e.g., changes in gut microbiome) in genetically susceptible individuals.

- **Possible Complications**:
  - Negative psychosocial impact
  - Toxic megacolon and bowel obstruction
  - Anemia
  - Malnutrition
  - Growth failure
  - Colorectal cancer

- **Diagnosis Indicators**:
  - Symptoms:
    - Bloody diarrhea lasting over 6 weeks
    - Rectal bleeding
    - Fecal urgency/incontinence
    - Nocturnal defecation

    - Pallor
    - Clubbing
    - Abdominal distension/tenderness/mass

- **Investigations**:
  - Full blood count
  - Inflammatory markers
  - Urea and electrolytes
  - Liver function tests
  - Thyroid function tests
  - Ferritin, vitamin B12, folate, vitamin D levels
  - Coeliac serology
  - Stool microscopy and culture (including Clostridioides difficile toxin, fecal calprotectin)

- **Management**:
  - **Emergency**: Hospital admission if systemically unwell with severe symptoms.
  - **Urgent Referral**: To a gastroenterologist if not requiring admission for diagnosis confirmation and treatment initiation.

- **Regular Review in Primary Care**:
  - Assess impact of symptoms on daily functioning.
  - Provide information and support (including contraception advice).
  - Assess osteoporosis risk and manage accordingly.
  - Ensure follow-up with gastroenterologist/specialist nurse.
  - Monitor adherence to specialist drug treatments (if shared-care agreement exists).
  - Assess for flare-up symptoms and manage appropriately.
  - Refer to specialists for suspected extra-intestinal manifestations or other needs (colorectal surgeon, stoma nurse, dietitian).
  - Ensure appropriate vaccinations.
