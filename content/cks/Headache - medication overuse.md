- **Definition**: Medication overuse headache (MOH) is characterized by:
  - Headache on 15+ days/month in individuals with a pre-existing primary headache disorder.
  - Results from regular overuse of acute/symptomatic headache treatment for >3 months.
  - Commonly resolves after stopping overused medication, though not always.

- **Types of Medications Leading to MOH**:
  - **Ergotamines**, **triptans**, **opioids**, or **combination analgesics**: taken on 10+ days/month.
  - **Simple analgesics** (e.g., paracetamol, NSAIDs, aspirin): taken on 15+ days/month.

- **Pre-existing Headache Disorders**:
  - 60-80% of cases are due to **migraine**; less commonly, **tension-type headache**.
  - MOH generally shares the same phenotype as the primary headache.

- **Pathophysiology**: 
  - Not fully understood, thought to involve complex interactions between medication overuse and individual susceptibility.

- **Prevalence**: 
  - Estimated 1-2% of the general population worldwide.

- **Complications**:
  - Stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances.
  - Increased risk of transition from episodic to chronic migraine if untreated.

- **Management**:
  - **Specialist Referral**: If red flags or serious secondary headache causes are suspected.
  - **Patient Education**: Provide information and support resources.
  - **Medication Withdrawal**: Advise stopping overused medications abruptly for at least 1 month; inform about potential initial worsening of headaches and withdrawal symptoms.
  - **Regular Review**: Monitor symptoms post-withdrawal and provide ongoing support.
  - **Reassessment**: 4-8 weeks after withdrawal to manage the underlying headache disorder.
  - **Prevent Relapse**: Discuss prophylactic medication options and restrict future acute medication use if necessary.
  - **Manage Associated Conditions**: Address anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and chronic pain.

- **Referral to Specialist**: Recommended if:
  - Diagnosis is uncertain or symptoms are atypical.
  - Management of MOH in primary care is unclear.
  - Previous withdrawal attempts have failed.
  - Patient is overusing strong opioids, barbiturates, or tranquilizers, or has significant comorbidities.
