## Addison's Disease Summary

- **Definition**: Addison's disease (primary adrenal insufficiency) is due to the destruction of the adrenal cortex, leading to reduced production of:
  - Glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol)
  - Mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone)
  - Adrenal androgens (e.g., dehydroepiandrosterone)

- **Causes**:
  - **Autoimmunity**: ~90% of cases in western countries.
  - Other causes: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, infections (e.g., tuberculosis).
  - Note: Long-term corticosteroid use or hypothalamus/pituitary disorders are not classified as Addison's disease.

- **Prevalence**:
  - Rare condition; approx. 9000 diagnosed cases in the UK, with 320 new diagnoses annually.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Often delayed due to non-specific symptoms overlapping with other conditions.
  - Symptoms may include:
    - Sudden crisis (precipitated by stress or illness)
    - Hypotension, hypovolaemic shock, acute abdominal pain, vomiting, reduced consciousness.
  - **Emergency Protocol**:
    - If adrenal crisis is suspected, arrange emergency admission and administer hydrocortisone IM/IV.
    - Do not delay treatment for investigations.

- **Consider in Patients**:
  - Persistent non-specific symptoms (fatigue, hyperpigmentation, gastrointestinal issues, salt craving, postural hypotension, muscle weakness/cramps).
  - Worsening symptoms of hypothyroidism when starting thyroxine.
  - Type 1 diabetes with unexplained hypoglycaemia.
  - Other autoimmune conditions.
  - Blood biochemistry showing low sodium and high potassium.

- **Investigations**:
  - In adults, if adrenal insufficiency is suspected:
    - 9 am serum cortisol and urea/electrolytes should be checked.
      - <100 nmol/L: admit to hospital (high likelihood of adrenal insufficiency).
      - 100-500 nmol/L: refer to endocrinology for further investigations.
  - In children, investigations should be urgent in secondary care; admission may be required.

- **Confirmation of Diagnosis**:
  - Adrenocorticotrophic hormone stimulation (SynacthenÂ®) test in secondary care.

- **Prognosis**:
  - Untreated Addison's disease is always fatal; lifelong treatment is necessary.

- **Treatment**:
  - Initiated and adjusted by a specialist endocrinologist; repeat prescriptions may be managed in primary care.
  - Common medications:
    - Hydrocortisone for glucocorticoid replacement.
    - Fludrocortisone for mineralocorticoid replacement.
    - Dehydroepiandrosterone (unlicensed) for androgen replacement (may be prescribed by specialists).

- **Self-Management**:
  - Increase corticosteroid cover during physical stress (illness, injury, surgery).
  - Recognize adrenal crisis symptoms and know how to administer intramuscular hydrocortisone.
  - Carry emergency information (steroid treatment card and MedicAlert identification).
