## Pubic Lice Summary

- **Definition**: Pubic lice (pediculosis pubis) caused by *Phthirus pubis*, a blood-sucking ectoparasite.
  
- **Transmission**:
  - Primarily through sexual contact.
  - Occasionally through close personal contact or shared articles (clothing, bedding, towels).

- **Location**:
  - Commonly found on pubic and perianal hair.
  - May also be found on coarse body hair (legs, armpits, chest, forearms, face, and eyelashes).
  - Note: Lice on the head are typically head lice.

- **Complications**:
  - Skin excoriation and infection from scratching.
  - Chronic cases may lead to lichenification and hyperpigmentation.
  - Eyelash involvement can cause blepharitis, conjunctivitis, or corneal epithelial keratitis.

- **Symptoms**:
  - Genital itching, typically worse at night.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Confirmation involves finding visible pubic lice (crab-shaped, tan to greyish-white, ~2 mm) or eggs (yellow-white, smaller than a pinhead).
  - Small blue macules (maculae cerulae) or red papules may appear at feeding sites.
  - Rust-colored flecks of fecal material may be visible on skin and underwear.

- **Management**:
  - **Primary Care Treatment**:
    - Use insecticides (permethrin or malathion).
    - Provide clear information about the condition, treatment application, and prevention measures (decontamination of clothing/bedding, avoiding close contact until treatment is completed).
    - Consider referral to a genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic for contact tracing and STI screening.
    - In children, assess for potential sexual abuse, but note that transmission can occur through non-genital contact.

- **Follow-Up**:
  - Arrange a follow-up 1 week after treatment to ensure infestation clearance.
  - If unresponsive to initial treatment (with correct application), use an alternative insecticide.

- **When to Seek Specialist Advice**:
  - Treatment fails despite using an alternative insecticide.
  - Uncertainty about treatment protocols.
  - Atypical clinical presentation or doubt regarding diagnosis.
