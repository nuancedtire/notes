## Dyspepsia - Proven Functional: Summary

- **Definition**: Dyspepsia refers to a complex of upper gastrointestinal tract symptoms lasting four or more weeks, including:
  - Upper abdominal pain or discomfort
  - Heartburn
  - Acid reflux
  - Nausea
  - Vomiting

- **GORD vs. Functional Dyspepsia**:
  - Predominantly heartburn and acid regurgitation suggests Gastro-Oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD).
  - Functional dyspepsia (non-ulcer dyspepsia) has normal endoscopy findings (no gastric/duodenal ulcers, malignancy, or oesophagitis).

- **Prevalence**: Functional dyspepsia is the most common diagnosis during dyspepsia investigations.

- **Sub-Types**:
  - **Epigastric Pain Syndrome**: Intermittent/burning pain in the epigastrium.
  - **Post-Prandial Distress Syndrome**: Post-prandial fullness or early satiety.

- **Pathophysiology**: Considered a disorder of gut-brain interaction.

- **Prognosis**:
  - 70% of patients may have persistent symptoms after one year if untreated.
  - Lifetime recurrence risk is about 50%.

### Initial Management
1. **Lifestyle Advice**: Suggest measures to improve symptoms.
2. **Mental Health Assessment**: Evaluate and manage stress, anxiety, and depression.
3. **Medication Review**: Identify and discontinue drugs worsening symptoms, if appropriate.
4. **H. pylori Testing**:
   - Use carbon-13 urea breath test or stool antigen test.
   - Ensure no proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in the last 2 weeks or antibiotics in the last 4 weeks.

### Treatment Based on H. pylori Status
- **Positive Test**: Offer first-line H. pylori eradication therapy.
- **Negative Test**: 
  - Offer low-dose PPI or standard-dose H2-receptor antagonist (H2RA) for 1 month.

### Recurrent/Refractory Symptoms
- **Re-testing for H. pylori**: Not routine but may be considered in certain cases.
- **If Positive**: Provide second-line H. pylori eradication therapy.
- **If Negative/Not Needed**: Offer low-dose PPI or standard-dose H2RA for 1 month.
- **Alternative Therapies**: Consider if symptoms persist.

### Long-Term Management
- Annual review for those on long-term treatment.
- Encourage stepping down or stopping treatment when possible.
- **Referral to Gastroenterologist** if:
  - Symptoms are refractory or recurrent despite optimal management.
  - Second-line H. pylori eradication fails.
  - Limited antibiotic options for H. pylori treatment.
