## Head Lice: Summary

- **Definition**: Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) are parasitic insects that infest human hair and feed on blood from the scalp. Infestation is called pediculosis capitis.

- **Infestation Severity**:
  - Ranges from fewer than 10 lice to over 1000.
  - Typical infestation: about 30 lice.

- **Persistence**: Infestations can last long if untreated.

- **Detection**:
  - Best method: Detection combing with a fine-toothed comb (0.2–0.3 mm apart).
  - Diagnosis confirmed only if a live louse is found.
  - An itchy scalp alone does not indicate active infestation.
  - Presence of louse eggs (nits) is not proof of active infestation.

- **Treatment**: 
  - Treat only if a live louse is found.
  - All affected household members should be treated on the same day.
  - Treatment options include:
    - Physical insecticide: dimeticone 4% lotion (Hedrin®).
    - Traditional insecticide: malathion 0.5% aqueous liquid (Derbac-M®).
    - Wet combing with a fine-toothed comb (e.g., Bug Buster®).
  - No treatment guarantees success; correct application and simultaneous treatment of all affected members increase effectiveness.
  
- **Post-Treatment**: 
  - Conduct detection combing after treatment to confirm success.
  - If live lice are found after treatment:
    - Verify correct treatment usage.
    - Assess household members and close contacts for reinfestation sources.
    - Repeat the same treatment or try a different one (consider resistance if malathion was used).

- **Advice**:
  - Children treated for head lice can still attend school.
  - No preference for clean or dirty hair.
  - No need to wash or fumigate clothing/bedding, as lice die within 1-2 days off a human host.
  - Essential oil-based and herbal treatments are not recommended due to insufficient evidence of safety and efficacy.
  - Prevention of infestation is not possible; regular home examinations using detection combs are advised for primary school children.
