- **Corticosteroids Overview**
  - Synthetic analogues of adrenal cortex hormones.
  - Can have glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid properties.
  - Dexamethasone and prednisolone: high glucocorticoid activity.
  - Fludrocortisone acetate: high mineralocorticoid activity.

- **Withdrawal Guidelines**
  - Short courses (<3 weeks) can be stopped abruptly.
  - Gradual withdrawal for patients with:
    - >40 mg oral prednisolone daily for >1 week.
    - Repeated evening doses of corticosteroids.
    - >3 weeks of corticosteroid treatment.
    - Recent repeated courses (especially >3 weeks).
    - Previous long-term therapy (months/years).
    - Other causes of adrenal suppression (e.g., alcohol, stress).
  - If stress occurs within 1 week of stopping, additional corticosteroid cover is needed.
  - During withdrawal:
    - Reduce to physiological doses (~7.5 mg prednisolone) rapidly, then taper slowly.

- **Contraindications and Cautions**
  - Contraindicated in systemic infections uncontrolled by antibiotics.
  - Use with caution in:
    - Hepatic impairment.
    - Psychiatric disorders (psychoses, severe affective disorders).
    - Wounds.
    - Pre-existing conditions (heart failure, diabetes, recent MI, hypertension).
  - Weigh risks vs. benefits in pregnancy.

- **Minimizing Adverse Effects**
  - Prescribe lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.
  - Morning dosing and alternate-day therapy may reduce adrenal suppression.
  - Provide a steroid treatment card for long-term users.
  - Proton pump inhibitors for gastrointestinal protection should be considered, not routinely prescribed.

- **Patient Advice**
  - Avoid contact with individuals with chickenpox, shingles, or measles if no history of those diseases.
  - Seek medical advice for mood or behavioral changes.
  - Regular monitoring (e.g., eye exams every 6â€“12 months).

- **Monitoring Before and During Long-Term Treatment**
  - Initial and ongoing monitoring of:
    - Blood pressure.
    - Body weight.
    - BMI.
    - Children's height.
    - HbA1c, triglycerides, potassium levels.
  - Assess osteoporosis and falls risk, especially in older patients.
  - Monitor height in children/adolescents.
  - Look for signs of adrenal suppression and conduct regular eye examinations.
