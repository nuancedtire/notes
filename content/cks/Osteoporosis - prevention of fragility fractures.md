## Osteoporosis - Prevention of Fragility Fractures Summary

### Overview
- **Definition**: Osteoporosis is a disease with low bone mass and structural deterioration, leading to increased fragility and fracture risk.
- **Asymptomatic**: Often goes undiagnosed until a fragility fracture occurs.
- **Fracture Types**: Commonly occurs in the wrist, spine, and hip.

### Fragility Fractures
- Defined as fractures from falls at standing height or less.
- Vertebral fractures can occur spontaneously or during routine activities.
- Approximately **180,000** osteoporosis-related fractures occur annually in England and Wales.

### Risk Factors
1. Female sex
2. Increasing age
3. Menopause
4. Oral corticosteroids
5. Smoking
6. Alcohol consumption
7. Previous fragility fracture
8. Rheumatological conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis)
9. Parental history of hip fracture
10. Body mass index (BMI) < 18.5 kg/m²

### Investigations
- Evaluate for non-osteoporotic and undiagnosed secondary causes (e.g., metastatic bone cancer, hyperthyroidism) before assessing fracture risk.
- Calculate a **10-year fragility fracture risk** score before arranging a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan or starting bisphosphonates, except for:
  - Individuals >50 years with a history of fragility fractures (DXA scan offered).
  - Individuals <40 years with major risk factors (DXA scan offered, may refer to a specialist based on BMD T-score).

### Risk Assessment
- Use **QFracture®** (preferred) or **FRAX®** calculators for assessing fragility fracture risk.
- High-risk individuals: Offer a DXA scan to confirm osteoporosis.
- Intermediate-risk individuals: Offer a DXA scan if near threshold and have underestimated risk factors (e.g., high-dose oral corticosteroids).
- Low-risk individuals: No treatment or DXA scan, but provide lifestyle advice.

### Treatment Recommendations
- **Bisphosphonates**: Offered to individuals with a BMD T-score of -2.5 or lower, if appropriate.
- **Hormone Replacement Therapy**: Considered for younger postmenopausal women for fracture risk reduction and menopausal symptom relief.
- Manage modifiable risk factors (smoking, alcohol, calcium, and vitamin D deficiency).
- Address fall risk factors.

### Follow-Up
- Assess and manage:
  - Adverse effects of bone-sparing treatment.
  - Adherence to treatment.
  - Need for continued bisphosphonate treatment after **3–5 years**.
