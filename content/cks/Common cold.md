- **Common Symptoms in Adults/Older Children**:

  - Nasal irritation, congestion, discharge (initially clear, then thicker/darker)
  - Cough (develops after nasal symptoms)

- **Management**:
  - Reassure that the cold is self-limiting; complications are rare.
  - Symptom relief and rest are key.
  - Advise against antibiotics and antihistamines (ineffective, may cause adverse effects).
  - Encourage adequate rest; normal activities won't prolong illness.
  - Use paracetamol or ibuprofen if necessary (for children under 5, only if feverish and distressed).
  - Consider additional self-care measures and over-the-counter products for symptom relief.
  - Advise follow-up if symptoms worsen or persist; earlier review for those with risk factors for complications.
