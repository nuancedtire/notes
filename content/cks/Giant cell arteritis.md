## Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA) Summary

- **Definition**: Chronic vasculitis with granulomatous inflammation in medium and large arteries.
- **Demographics**: Primarily affects individuals over 50 years of age.
- **Incidence**: Approximately 2.2 per 10,000 person-years in the UK.

### Complications
- **Preventable by Treatment**: Adequate corticosteroid doses can prevent:
  - Vision loss
  - Large artery complications (e.g., aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, large artery stenosis)
  - Cardiovascular disease (e.g., stroke)
- **Relapse Rate**: Up to 50% of cases may experience relapses.

### Clinical Indicators
- **Suspicion Criteria** (age ≥ 50 with):
  - New-onset unilateral headache (temporal area)
  - Temporal artery abnormality (tenderness, thickening, nodularity)

### Other Symptoms
- Visual disturbances (vision loss, diplopia)
- Scalp tenderness
- Intermittent jaw claudication
- Systemic features (fever, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, depression)
- Features of polymyalgia rheumatica
- Neurological features (e.g., stroke)
- Physical signs (bruits, blood pressure difference between arms, intermittent limb claudication)

### Medical Emergency
- **Visual Loss or Diplopia**: Urgent (same day) ophthalmologist assessment required. 
- **Primary Care Action**: High-dose corticosteroid treatment may be advised while awaiting referral.

### Specialist Referral
- Discuss suspected GCA urgently with a specialist.
- Fast track referral to secondary care recommended.
- Specialist evaluation (preferably by rheumatologist) within 3 working days.

### Treatment Guidelines
- **Initial Glucocorticoid Dose**: 
  - For GCA without visual symptoms: 40–60 mg oral prednisolone daily.
- **Blood Tests**: Consider full blood count, ESR, C-reactive protein; do not delay referral for results.

### Post-Diagnosis Management
- Assess prognostic factors and comorbidities (infection, diabetes, hypertension, etc.).
- Initiate glucocorticoid treatment until symptoms and inflammatory markers resolve.
- Tapering schedules determined by specialists post-remission (typically 1–2 years duration).
- Regular reviews to monitor for relapse and steroid-related side effects.

### Relapse Management
- Seek urgent advice from a specialist if relapse occurs.
- Potential increase in corticosteroid dose or adjunctive treatment may be necessary.
- New-onset visual disturbances during relapse requires urgent ophthalmology assessment.
