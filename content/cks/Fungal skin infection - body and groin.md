### Fungal Skin Infection - Body and Groin: Key Points

#### Definition:
- **Tinea Corporis**: Fungal infection of the body.
- **Tinea Cruris**: Fungal infection of the groin.
- Predominantly caused by dermatophytes, primarily **Trichophyton rubrum**.

#### Causes:
- Groin infections often result from **autoinoculation** from hands, feet, or nails.

#### Risk Factors:
- Hot, humid environments
- Tight-fitting clothing
- Obesity
- Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)

#### Diagnosis:
- Based on clinical features:
  - Scaly, itchy skin
  - Red or pink, flat or slightly raised annular patches (ring-shaped), varying in size, enlarging outward
  - Active red, scaly advancing edge with a clear central area
  - Involvement of inguinal folds and proximal medial thighs; scaly edges may be obscured in moist areas.

#### Assessment:
- **History Taking**:
  - Symptoms: nature, site, duration
  - Previous treatments
  - Family or close contacts affected
  - Co-morbidities
- **Physical Examination**:
  - Assess pattern, extent, severity of infection, and any inflammation or fungal infection at other sites.
- **Skin Sampling**:
  - For fungal microscopy and culture if severe/extensive disease or uncertain diagnosis.

#### Initial Management:
- **Self-Care**:
  - Advice on strategies and reliable information sources.
- **Topical Treatment**:
  - Mild, non-extensive disease: Topical antifungal (e.g., **terbinafine**, **imidazole**).
  - Consider short-term mild corticosteroid (e.g., **hydrocortisone cream**) for inflammation.
- **Oral Antifungal**:
  - First-line for severe/extensive disease in adults: **terbinafine** (with consideration of microscopy/culture results).
  - Alternatives: **itraconazole**, **griseofulvin** if terbinafine is intolerable/contraindicated.
- **Manage Concomitant Infections**:
  - Address fungal nail, foot, or hand infections to reduce reinfection risk.

#### Persistent Infection Management:
- Investigate underlying causes (non-adherence, reinfection, tinea incognito).
- Arrange skin sampling for microscopy/culture.
- Prescribe oral antifungal based on results and clinical judgment.

#### Referral to Dermatology:
- Urgent referral if:
  - Severe/extensive disease or treatment failure in children.
  - Uncertain diagnosis.
  - Frequent recurrences or unsuccessful treatment in primary care.
  - Immunocompromised patients, as per clinical judgment.
