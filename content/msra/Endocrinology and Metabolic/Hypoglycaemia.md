**Hypoglycaemia Overview**
- Most common endocrine emergency; blood sugar levels fall below normal range.
- Can lead to brain damage and death if untreated.
- Often affects people with diabetes, especially with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents.

### **Diagnosis**
- Diagnosis depends on patient situation.
- Common threshold: "four is the floor" (4 mmol/L).
- Symptoms may vary based on individual tolerance; some may not feel symptoms until glucose is significantly lower (e.g., 2.5 mmol/L).

#### **Symptoms**
**Autonomic Symptoms (around 3.6 mmol/L)**
- Sweating
- Palpitations
- Shaking/Tremor
- Dizziness
- Anxiety
- Hunger
- Nausea

**Neuroglycopenic Symptoms (around 2.7 mmol/L)**
- Drowsiness
- Confusion
- Aggression
- Visual disturbances
- Seizures
- Coma
- Incoherence

#### **Causes**
1. **Fasting Hypoglycaemia**
   - **Diabetic Causes:**
     - Excessive use of blood-sugar-lowering drugs.
     - Increased activity or missed meals.
   - **Non-Diabetic Causes:** 
     - Exogenous drugs, pituitary insufficiency, liver failure, Addisonâ€™s disease, insulinomas, non-pancreatic neoplasms.
     - **Insulinoma:** Rare pancreatic tumor presenting with Whipple's triad.

2. **Post-Prandial Hypoglycaemia**
   - Occurs after bariatric surgery or in type 2 diabetics.

### **Investigations**
- Finger prick capillary glucose test for known diabetics.
- Consider further investigations for unknown causes post-treatment.

### **Management of Emergencies**
- Hypoglycaemia is a medical emergency; hypoglycaemic unawareness poses risks (e.g., driving restrictions).
- Important to check blood glucose levels immediately.

### **Management (Prescribing)**
**Severity-Based Treatment:**
1. **Mild (conscious, self-treat)**:
   - Sugary foods/drinks.
   
2. **Moderate (conscious, needs help)**:
   - 1-2 tubes of Glucogel or similar buccally.
   - IM Glucagon (if available).

3. **Severe (unconscious)**:
   - Do NOT put anything in mouth.
   - Recovery position.
   - Administer 0.5-1mg IM glucagon.
   - Call 999 if unable to administer.
   - Wait 10 minutes: if improved, provide sugary drink/snack; if not, call 999.

4. **In Hospital**:
   - IV glucose: 75 ml of 20% glucose or 150 ml of 10% in 15 minutes. Avoid 50% glucose due to risk of chemical burns.

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- For mild hypoglycaemia, consume 15-20 grams of fast-acting carbohydrates:
  - Sugary drinks, sweets, glucose tablets, fruit juice.
- Retest blood sugar after 10-15 minutes; repeat if necessary.
- Inform diabetes team of frequent occurrences or symptoms of hypo unawareness.
