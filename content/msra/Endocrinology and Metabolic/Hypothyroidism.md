## Hypothyroidism Overview

- **Definition**: Underproduction of thyroid hormones (T4 and T3).
- **Types**: 
  - **Primary Hypothyroidism**: 95% of cases; caused by insufficient hormone production.
  - **Secondary Hypothyroidism**: 5% of cases; due to low TSH by the pituitary gland.

### Diagnosis

#### Common Symptoms:
- Weakness
- Lethargy
- Fatigue
- Hoarseness
- Cold sensations
- Forgetfulness
- Constipation
- Weight gain

#### Examination Findings:
- Slow speech and movement
- Coarse, dry skin
- Eyelid oedema
- Thick tongue
- Facial oedema
- Bradycardia
- Diastolic hypertension
- Narrow pulse pressure
- Delayed tendon reflexes

#### Risk Factors:
- Iodine deficiency (common in developing countries)
- Female sex (autoimmune thyroiditis more common in women)
- Middle age (peak incidence 30-50 years)
- Lithium use (can induce anti-thyroid antibodies)
- Amiodarone use (may develop hypothyroidism)
- Previously treated hyperthyroidism

### Investigations

- **TSH Levels**: Most sensitive for diagnosing primary hypothyroidism; raised in hypothyroidism.
- **Free T4**: Identify extent of hypothyroidism or diagnose sub-acute hypothyroidism (asymptomatic, mild TSH elevation).
- **Auto-antibody Testing**: Not necessary after diagnosis.
- **Other Tests**: FBC and fasting blood glucose in patients with non-specific fatigue and weight gain; low serum sodium and elevated creatine kinase may indicate primary hypothyroidism.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Goal**: Symptom management, reduce long-term complications.
- **Levothyroxine**: Drug of choice for lifelong therapy.

#### Dosing Guidelines:
- **Age <50-60 years, no cardiac history**: 1.6 micrograms/kg/day; adjust to normalize TSH.
- **Age >60 years or with [[coronary artery disease]]**: Start with 25-50 micrograms/day; adjust every 6-8 weeks.
- **Sub-clinical (TSH>10mIU/L)**: Start with 1 microgram/kg/day; adjust to normalize TSH.

#### Monitoring:
- TSH levels measured 4-6 weeks after starting therapy or dosage changes.
- Main complication: Over-replacement increases osteoporosis and [[atrial fibrillation]] risk.
- Address persistent symptoms despite normal TSH levels with alternatives like liothyronine.
