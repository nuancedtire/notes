## Adrenal Insufficiency Overview

### Classification
- **Primary**: Pathology in the adrenal gland itself; known as Addisonâ€™s disease.
- **Secondary**: Deficient ACTH due to pituitary gland pathology.
- **Tertiary**: Dysfunctional hypothalamus affecting CRH stimulation of the pituitary gland.

### Common Presentation
- Tertiary adrenal insufficiency is prevalent due to chronic exogenous steroids leading to suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary axis.
- Abrupt steroid discontinuation can precipitate insufficiency.

### Diagnosis
- Relatively rare in developed worlds: 0.8 per 100,000.
- >70% of cases in developed regions caused by autoimmune diseases.
- In developing regions, infections (e.g., tuberculosis) are common causes.

### Symptoms
- Weakness (100%)
- Fatigue (100%)
- Anorexia (100%)
- Gastrointestinal issues: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (86%)
- Hypotension (common sign).

#### Other Signs & Symptoms
1. **Primary only**:
   - Hyperpigmentation (excess ACTH)
   - Vitiligo (autoimmune)
   - Salt craving
   - Hyperkalaemia
2. Hyponatraemia
3. Weight loss (chronic)
4. Postural hypotension
5. Muscle & joint pains
6. Hypoglycaemia (chronic deficiency)
7. Uraemia
8. Anaemia

### Investigations
1. Measure serum cortisol & ACTH.
2. Synthetic ACTH (Synacthen) stimulation test (diagnostic gold standard).
3. Further aetiology investigations (e.g., autoimmune antibodies, TB screen, CT/MRI).

#### Specific Findings
- **Primary**: High ACTH, low cortisol; Synacthen test shows no cortisol rise.
- **Secondary/Tertiary**: Low ACTH, normal/high cortisol; Synacthen test shows a cortisol rise.

### Adrenal Crisis
- Acute presentation of adrenal insufficiency; severe hypotension leads to shock.
- Symptoms include abdominal pain, confusion, fever.
- Precipitated by illness or acute causes (e.g., adrenal hemorrhage).

### Management of Acute Crisis
1. **Lab Samples**: ACTH and cortisol - do not wait for results.
2. **IV Hydrocortisone**: 100 mg stat, followed by continuous infusions; Dexamethasone 4 mg stat as an alternative.
3. **IV Fluid Resuscitation**: 1-3 liters 0.9% NaCl; add 5% Dextrose if hypoglycaemia present.

### Long-term Management
#### Prescribing
- **Glucocorticoids**: Divided doses (higher in the morning):
  - Example: Oral Hydrocortisone 10 mg mane, 5 mg noon, 5 mg evening.
- **Mineralocorticoids**: Fludrocortisone (50-300 micrograms/day) for primary insufficiency.
- **Androgens**: DHEA for quality of life; not universally endorsed.

#### Non-prescribing
- Patient education on disease and hormonal changes.
- Training for emergency hydrocortisone injections.
- Sick-day rules: double/treble hydrocortisone dose during illness/stress.
- MedicAlert bracelet/necklace and steroid card advised for all patients.
