### Cushing’s Syndrome Overview
Cushing’s Syndrome is an endocrine disorder characterized by elevated cortisol levels in the blood. Causes are categorized as ACTH dependent and ACTH independent.

#### Causes
- **ACTH Dependent** (Low CRH, High ACTH, High Cortisol):
  - **Pituitary Adenoma**: More common in males, often microadenomas; known as Cushing’s disease.
  - **Ectopic ACTH**: E.g., small cell lung carcinomas.

- **ACTH Independent** (Low CRH, Low ACTH, High Cortisol):
  - **Exogenous**: Most common cause (e.g., glucocorticoid therapy).
  - **Adrenal Adenoma**
  - **Adrenal Carcinoma**
  - **Micronodular Adrenal Dysplasia** (rare)
  - **Carney Complex Syndrome**

### Diagnosis
- Most commonly affects individuals aged 20-40.
- Estimated prevalence: 10-15 per million annually.

#### Common Signs and Symptoms
- Hypertension
- Weight gain
- Fatigue
- Round, red face
- Poor concentration and memory
- Menstrual irregularity
- Excessive hair growth in women

#### Unusual Presentations
- Depression
- Acne
- Insomnia
- Thin skin and striae
- Recurrent infections
- Osteoporosis-related fractures
- Muscle wasting
- Truncal obesity/buffalo hump
- Diabetes mellitus
- Growth retardation in children
- Skin pigmentation in Cushing’s disease

#### Differential Diagnoses
- Alcoholism
- Obesity
- Depression
- Anorexia
- Nelson’s syndrome

### Investigations
1. **Confirming Cushing’s Syndrome**:
   - **24-hour Urinary Cortisol**: Elevated levels confirm Cushing’s.
   - **Low Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test**: Unchanged cortisol levels indicate endogenous Cushing’s.

2. **Localizing Tests**:
   - **ACTH Plasma Levels**:
     - Low: Adrenal adenomas/carcinomas (ACTH independent).
     - High: Cushing disease/ectopic ACTH production (ACTH dependent).
   - **High Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test**:
     - Reduction in cortisol: ACTH dependent pituitary tumor.
     - No change: ACTH independent or ectopic tumor.
   - **CRH Stimulation and Petrosal Sinus Sampling**: Differentiate ectopic vs. pituitary ACTH.

3. **Imaging**:
   - **MRI**: Pituitary tumors.
   - **CT**: Adrenal glands and chest/abdominal/pelvic tumors.

### Management
#### Prescribing
- Without treatment: Poor prognosis (MI, heart failure, infections, death).
- **Exogenous Steroid Therapy**: Gradual titration to reduce symptoms and prevent adrenal crisis.
- **Adrenal Steroid Inhibitors**: Ketoconazole and metyrapone to control cortisol before surgery.

#### Non-Prescribing
- **Surgical Removal**: Most effective treatment (often tumor removal).
- **Radiotherapy**: Used post-surgery for cancerous causes.
- **Trans-sphenoidal Removal**: Gold-standard for pituitary adenoma (Cushing’s disease).
