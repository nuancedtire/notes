## Primary Aldosteronism (PA)

### Overview
- **Definition**: Disorder with excess aldosterone production, not properly regulated by the renin-angiotensin II system.
- **Consequences**: Causes excessive sodium reabsorption, leading to:
  - Hypertension
  - Suppression of renin-angiotensin II
  - Possible hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis in severe cases.

### Diagnosis
- **Consider in hypertensive patients**: All patients with hypertension should be evaluated for PA, regardless of potassium levels.
- **Symptoms of hypokalaemia**:
  - Muscle weakness
  - Paraesthesia
  - Muscle cramps
  - Nocturia
  - Polyuria
  - Palpitations
- **Non-specific symptoms**:
  - Lethargy
  - Difficulty concentrating
  - Mood disturbances (irritability, anxiety, depression)
- **Risk factors**:
  - Age 20-70 years
  - Family history of PA
  - Family history of early-onset hypertension/stroke

### Investigations
#### 1st Line Investigations:
- **Plasma potassium**: Low in ~20% of PA cases; careful to avoid false elevations.
- **Aldosterone/renin ratio**: Reliable screening test; false results possible depending on diuretics and timing.

#### Further Investigations:
- **Fludrocortisone suppression test**: Reliable for confirming/excluding PA.
- **Saline infusion test**: Alternative for confirmation/exclusion.
- **Oral salt loading test**: Alternative but can have issues with urine collection/aldosterone measurement.
- **Adrenal venous sampling**: Identifies unilateral/bilateral adrenal hyperaldosteronism:
  - **Unilateral**: Adenoma, carcinoma, or hyperplasia.
  - **Bilateral**: Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia.
- **Genetic testing**: For subtype determination.
- **Adrenal CT scan**: Useful for large tumors but may miss smaller adenomas.

### Management (Prescribing)
- Consider results of adrenal sampling and patient preferences.
- **For non-familial hyperaldosteronism**:
  - **1st line**: Aldosterone antagonists (amiloride, spironolactone, eplerenone).
  - Monitor for volume contraction, hyperkalaemia, and adjust diuretics if needed.
- **For familial hyperaldosteronism**:
  - **1st line**: Glucocorticoids (dexamethasone, prednisolone).
  - **2nd line**: Aldosterone antagonists (amiloride, spironolactone, eplerenone).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Surgery**: Candidates detected through adrenal venous sampling; unilateral adrenalectomy beneficial in 55% of cases and improves quality of life.
- **Bilateral PA Candidates**: May lower required doses of aldosterone blockers post-op.
- **Preoperative care**: Discontinue potassium supplements/antagonists and reduce antihypertensive therapy.
- **Post-operative care**: Monitor for residual hypertension; medication start may be deferred for weeks.
