## Hyperthyroidism Overview

- **Underlying Diseases**: Various diseases can lead to hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis), but clinical manifestations are generally independent of the cause.
  
- **Symptoms**:
  - Heat intolerance
  - Tremor
  - Palpitations
  - Anxiety
  - Weight loss with normal intake
  - Increased bowel movements
  - Shortness of breath

- **Common Cause**: Graves’ disease (autoimmune condition) is the primary cause in iodine-sufficient countries, with extrathyroidal manifestations.

## Diagnosis

- **Symptoms by Organ Systems**:

  **Skin**:
  - Warm, smooth, increased sweating
  - Oncholysis and softening of nails
  - Hyperpigmentation in severe cases
  - Thinning hair
  
  **Eyes**:
  - Stare and lid lag due to sympathetic overactivity
  
  **Cardiovascular**:
  - Increased cardiac output
  - Common systolic hypertension
  - [[Atrial fibrillation]] (10-20% incidence)

  **Bone**:
  - Increased bone reabsorption, leading to osteoporosis

  **Respiratory**:
  - Dyspnea on exertion, weak respiratory muscles, potential tracheal obstruction, exacerbated asthma, elevated pulmonary arterial pressure

  **Gastrointestinal**:
  - Weight loss from hypermetabolism, malabsorption
  - Hyperphagia in most patients; appetite stimulation may lead to weight gain in younger patients

  **Hematologic**:
  - Increased red blood cell mass; normochromic, normocytic anemia due to increased plasma volume

  **Genitourinary**:
  - Common urinary frequency and nocturia
  - Amenorrhea in women with severe hyperthyroidism
  - Men may experience gynecomastia, reduced libido, erectile dysfunction

  **Neuropsychiatric**:
  - Behavioral changes like psychosis, anxiety, restlessness

  **Specific to Graves’ Disease**:
  - Ophthalmopathy (exophthalmos), thymic enlargement, pretibial myxedema, autoimmune disorders.

## Investigations

- **Thyroid Function Tests**:
  - Serum TSH
  - Serum-free or total T4
  - Serum-free or total T3

- **Conditions**:
  - Overt hyperthyroidism: Low TSH, high free T4/T3
  - T3-toxicosis: Low TSH, high T3, greater increase than T4
  - T4-toxicosis: Low TSH, high free T4, normal T3
  - Subclinical hyperthyroidism: Low TSH, normal T4/T3
  - TSH-induced hyperthyroidism: High TSH, high T4/T3

## Emergency Diagnosis and Management

- **Aetiology**: Can develop from longstanding hyperthyroidism, often triggered by acute events (surgery, trauma, infection).

- **Diagnosis**: Severe symptoms (tachycardia >140 BPM, hyperpyrexia >40°C, altered mental state, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

- **Treatment**:
  - Beta-blockers (control adrenergic symptoms)
  - Thionamide (block hormone synthesis)
  - Iodine solution (block hormone release)
  - Glucocorticoids (reduce T4 to T3 conversion)
  - ICU care as needed.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Goals**: Normalize thyroid function based on underlying cause, primarily Graves' disease treatment.

### Antithyroid Drugs:

- **Carbimazole**:
  - Initial: 20-40 mg/day
  - Maintenance: 5-15 mg/day

### Block and Replace Regime:

- **Carbimazole**: 40-60 mg/day (titrate according to response) 
- **Levothyroxine**: 100-150 mcg/day once euthyroid.

### Symptomatic Management:

- **Beta-blockers**: Propranolol 80-160 mg/day or Atenolol 50-100 mg/day
- **Calcium Channel Blockers**: Diltiazem or Verapamil.

- **Orbitopathy**: Lubricant eyedrops for mild cases; moderate to severe cases may require methylprednisolone.

## Management (Non-prescribing)

- **Radioactive Iodine**: First-line or secondary if other treatments fail; intended to ablate thyroid tissue.

- **Surgical Intervention**: Indications include:
  - Women planning pregnancy soon
  - Symptomatic compression from large goiters
  - Low radioactive iodine uptake
  - Suspected malignancy
  - Large nodules

- **Preparation for Surgery**: Antithyroid medications until achieving euthyroid state.

- **Post-operative Requirement**: Lifelong thyroxine replacement.
