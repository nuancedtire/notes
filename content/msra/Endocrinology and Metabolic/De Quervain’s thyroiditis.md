### De Quervain’s Thyroiditis Overview

**Also Known As:** Subacute Granulomatous Thyroiditis  
**Nature:** Inflammatory thyroid disease  
**Phases (weeks to months):**
- Transient thyrotoxicosis
- Hypothyroidism 
- Return to normal thyroid function (>90% patients)

**Aetiology:** Presumed viral

### Diagnosis

**Clinical Features during Thryotoxicity Phase:**
- Sudden onset of viral-like illness
- Fever (> 38°C)
- Myalgia
- Malaise
- Pharyngitis (viral association)
- Palpitations (tachycardia)
- Tremor
- Heat intolerance 
- **Thyroid Pain:**
  - Sudden neck pain worsening over days
  - Severe anterior neck pain over thyroid
  - Radiates to jaw or ears 
  - Mimics pain from tooth/ear infections
  - Associated with enlarged, firm thyroid gland

**Hypothyroid Phase:**
- Typically asymptomatic with abnormal blood tests.

### Investigations

**Initial Tests:**
- **Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs):**
  - Thyrotoxicosis: Low TSH, high T4 and T3 (T3:T4 ratio <15:1)
  - Hypothyroid: High but variable TSH, slightly low T4 and T3
  - Recovery: TSH, T4, T3 return to normal
- **Radioiodine Uptake Test:**
  - Thyrotoxicosis: Very low uptake (1-3% over 24 hours); thyroid cannot be imaged.
  - Differentiation from other causes of thyroid pain (normal TFTs, normal iodine uptake).

**Additional Notes:**
- ESR and CRP may be elevated but are non-specific.
- Biopsy via fine-needle aspiration is generally unnecessary unless clinical findings suggest otherwise.

### Management

**Medication (Thyrotoxic Phase):**
- Analgesia (NSAIDs) for thyroid pain
- High dose corticosteroids (if NSAIDs inadequate)
- Beta-blockers (first-line) / Calcium channel blockers (second-line for tachycardia, anxiety, tremor)
  - Ensure patient hydration
- Potassium iodine + prednisolone for severe thyrotoxicosis (inhibits T3 formation)

**Medication (Hypothyroid Phase):**
- Levothyroxine (if quality of life severely affected or moderate disease with TSH >15 microunits/ml)

**Non-Prescribing Management:**
- Many do not require treatment; monitor TSH and symptoms every 4-6 weeks in hypothyroid phase.
- Complete recovery in ≥90% of patients; no long-term monitoring post-recovery needed.
