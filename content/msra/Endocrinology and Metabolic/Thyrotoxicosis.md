## Thyrotoxicosis Overview

- **Definition**: Clinical syndrome of excessive thyroid hormones, usually from hyperthyroidism.
- **Demographics**: Common in young adults (20-40 years), more prevalent in women (10x more than men).

### Diagnosis 

#### Symptoms
- Increased appetite
- Weight loss
- Sweating
- Palpitations
- Tremors
- Irritability
- Heat intolerance
- Diarrhoea
- Oligomenorrhoea

#### Signs
- Tachycardia / [[Atrial Fibrillation]]
- Fine tremor
- Palmar erythema
- Lid lag / Lid retraction
- Goitre
- **Graves’ Disease Indicators**:
  - Exophthalmos
  - Ophthalmoplegia
  - Pretibial myxoedema
  - Thyroid acropachy (clubbing of nails)

#### Causes
- **Graves’ Disease**: ¾ of hyperthyroid patients.
- Toxic multinodular goitre / toxic adenoma: Extra thyroid tissue.
- **Exogenous**: Iodine or levothyroxine excess.
- Other causes:
  - Medications (e.g., Amiodarone)
  - Cancer
  - Subacute De Quervain’s thyroiditis
  - Pituitary adenoma
  - High hCG levels (postpartum, multiple pregnancies, molar pregnancy)

### Investigations
- **Thyroid Function Tests**:
  - Primary hyperthyroidism: Low TSH, High T4/T3.
  - Secondary hyperthyroidism: High TSH, High T4.
- Consider thyroid autoantibodies for Graves’ disease.
- Isotope scan for unclear causes (thyroid nodules/thyroiditis).
- Assess eye health in Graves’ disease (visual fields, acuity, movements, ophthalmoscopy).
- Referral to an endocrinologist.

### Management 

#### Prescribing
- **Beta-blockers** (e.g., Propranolol 40mg every 6 hours) to control symptoms.
- **Thionamides**:
  - Carbimazole
  - Propylthiouracil
  - Methods:
    - Titration: Adjust doses based on thyroid function tests.
    - Block and Replace: Thionamides + thyroxine to prevent iatrogenic hypothyroidism.
  - Relapse in 50% of Graves' disease cases; may require radiotherapy or surgery.
  
##### Thionamide Side Effects:
- Agranulocytosis: Contact doctor for sore throat, cough, or high temperature.
- Gastrointestinal upset
- Altered taste
- Headaches
- Joint pain
- Itchy rash

#### Non-Prescribing
- **Radioactive Iodine Treatment (RAI)**:
  - Destroys thyroid cells, reduces hormone production.
  - Precautions:
    - Avoid close contact with children/pregnant women.
    - Women: Avoid pregnancy for 6 months.
    - Men: Avoid fathering a child for 4 months.
- **Surgery**:
  - Indications: Large goitre, severe eye problems, ineffective treatment, recurrent symptoms.
  - Note: Patients will need lifelong medication post-surgery.
