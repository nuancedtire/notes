Osteoporosis is a progressive condition of weakened bones, increasing fracture risk. Over 3 million people in the UK are affected, with over 500,000 experiencing fragility fractures annually. Over 80% of hip fractures occur in women over 50.

**Diagnosis**

- **Fragility Fractures**: Occur from minimal force (e.g., crush vertebrae for trabecular bone, long bone fractures for cortical bone). Common sites include the hip, spine, ribs, wrists.
- **Bone Mineral Density (BMD)**:
  - Confirmed via DEXA scan; T-score ≤ -2.5 indicates osteoporosis.
- **Risk Assessment**: NICE recommends assessing:
  - Women > 65, Men > 75
  - Women 50-64, Men 50-74 with risk factors
  - Anyone under 50 with specific conditions or fragility fractures

### Risk Factors

#### Non-modifiable
- Age
- Gender (Female)
- Ethnicity (Asian/European)
- Family history
- Previous fragility fractures

#### Potentially Modifiable
- Alcohol consumption (> 4 units daily)
- Low dietary calcium
- Immobility
- Low BMI (< 22)

#### Secondary Causes
- Long-term steroid use
- Hormonal imbalances (hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism)
- Renal/Liver failure
- Inflammatory bone diseases

### Investigations
- **DEXA Scan**: 
  - T Score Interpretation:
    - > 0: Better than reference
    - 0 to -1: Normal BMD
    - -1 to -2.5: Osteopenia
    - ≤ -2.5: Osteoporosis
- **Guidelines**: DEXA needed after low-trauma fractures, for at-risk populations, and before long-term steroid use.
- **FRAX Score**: Estimates 10-year fracture risk; used with or without BMD.
- **Biochemical Markers**: Normal in osteoporosis to exclude other conditions.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Bisphosphonates** (e.g., Alendronic Acid):
  - First-line treatment, side effects include GI issues and potential severe outcomes.
- **Strontium Ranelate**: Alternative to bisphosphonates.
- **Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs)**: Reduces fracture risk and breast cancer incidence but may cause blood clots.
- **Parathyroid Hormones**: For those with fractures on other medications.
- **Hormone Replacement Therapy**: Effective in post-menopausal women; assess risk/benefit.
- **Testosterone Treatment**: For men with low testosterone.
- **Calcium and Vitamin D**: Commonly supplemented.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

Encourage lifestyle changes:
- Quit smoking and limit alcohol
- Regular exercise (weight-bearing and balance)
- Healthy diet rich in Vitamin D and Calcium; consider vitamin D supplements
- Education on fall prevention
