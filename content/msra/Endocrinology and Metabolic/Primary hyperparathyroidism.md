## Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT)

### Overview
- **Condition**: Endocrine disorder causing excess parathyroid hormone (PTH).
- **Metabolic Impact**: Disrupts calcium metabolism.
- **Common Cause**: 80% due to single parathyroid adenoma; less frequently multi-gland involvement or parathyroid cancer.

### Diagnosis
- **Incidental Detection**: Common in Europe and US via routine lab tests.
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Rare cases present with hypercalcaemia; symptoms often noted in resource-poor countries. 
- **Common Symptoms**:
  - Fatigue
  - Poor sleep
  - Myalgia
  - Anxiety
  - Depression
  - Memory loss
  - Bone pain
  - Constipation
  - Muscle cramps
  - Paresthesia
- **Uncommon Symptoms**:
  - Overt neuromuscular dysfunction
  - Abdominal pain
  - Cardiovascular/metabolic dysfunction
- **Related Medical History**:
  - Osteoporosis
  - Osteopenia
  - Nephrolithiasis
  - Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1, 2A or 4
  - Hyperthyroidism-jaw tumour syndrome
  - Family history of hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcaemia
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Female sex (2-3 times more common)
  - Age >50 years
  - Lithium treatment (current or historical)
- **Physical Exam**: Usually unremarkable; hard-dense neck mass may suggest carcinoma.

### Investigations
- **Diagnostic Criteria**:
  - Elevated serum calcium
  - Inappropriately unsuppressed serum intact PTH
  - Normal/raised urinary calcium with normal renal function.
  
- **1st Line Investigations**:
  - **Serum Calcium**: Elevated implies PHPT; retest if high-normal levels.
  - **Serum Intact PTH**: Elevated levels confirm PHPT if calcium is elevated.

- **Additional Investigations**:
  - **24-hour Urinary Calcium**: Differentiates PHPT from familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia.
  - **25 Hydroxyvitamin D Level**: Check vitamin D levels; deficiency can elevate PTH.
  - **Serum Alkaline Phosphate**: Elevated levels indicate high bone turnover.
  - **DXA Scan**: Assesses disease progression (spine, hip, forearm).

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Vitamin D Supplementation**:
  - Ergocalciferol
  - Colecalciferol
- **Bisphosphonates for Osteoporosis**:
  - Alendronic acid
  - Risedronate sodium
  - Ibandronic acid
  - Zoledronic acid
- **Cinacalcet**: Consider for symptomatic patients who decline surgery or are not surgical candidates.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Surgery**: Definitive treatment, indicated for symptomatic PHPT, with specific end-organ complications:
  - Bone disease/fractures
  - Renal stones
  - Overt neuromuscular dysfunction
- **Surgery Indications for Asymptomatic Patients**:
  - Age <50 years
  - Inability to ensure follow-up
  - Serum calcium >0.25mmol/L
  - Creatinine clearance <60mL/minute
  - Bone mineral density T-score <-2.5 or vertebral fractures
  - 24-hour urinary calcium >400mg/day with increased stone risk
  - Presence of nephrolithiasis
