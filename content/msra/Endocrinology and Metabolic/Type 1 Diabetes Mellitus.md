## Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)

### Overview
- Autoimmune, metabolic disease
- Characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia due to destruction of insulin-producing beta cells
- Accounts for 5-10% of diabetes cases
- Onset typically between ages 4-6 and 10-14, but can develop at any age
- Associated with HLA-DR3, HLA-DR4; links to other autoimmune conditions (e.g., Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, coeliac disease)

### Complications
- Requires regular monitoring and good glycaemic control
- **Macrovascular Disease**: Less common in T1DM—related to metabolic risk factors
- **Microvascular Disease**: Develops 5-10 years post-onset; includes nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, foot issues

### Diagnosis
- May present with DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis)
  
#### Classic Symptoms of Hyperglycaemia
- **Polyuria**: Excess urination
- **Polydipsia**: Excess thirst
- **Polyphagia**: Excess hunger
- **Weight loss**

#### Nonspecific Symptoms
- Fatigue
- Visual disturbances
- Poor wound healing
- Pruritus

#### Diagnostic Criteria (WHO)
1. **Symptomatic**: Symptoms + raised glucose (fasting >7mmol/l; random >11.1mmol/l)
2. **Asymptomatic**: Raised glucose on 2 separate occasions, or OGTT values, or HbA1C >48mmol/mol (6.5%)

### Investigations
- Blood glucose measurements and OGTT
- Check for autoantibodies (Anti-GAD, IA-2)
- C-peptide levels to assess insulin deficiency
- Urine analysis for microalbuminuria, glucosuria, ketone bodies

### Emergencies in T1DM

#### Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
- **Manifestation**: Often initial symptom of T1DM
- **Pathophysiology**: Lack of insulin leads to starvation-like state; body produces ketones
- **Symptoms**: Gradual drowsiness, vomiting, abdominal pain, polyuria/polydipsia, ketotic breath
- **Diagnosis Criteria**:
  - Acidaemia: pH <7.3 or HCO3- <15.0
  - Hyperglycaemia: Blood glucose >11.0
  - Ketonaemia: Levels >3.0

#### Hypoglycaemia
- Defined as plasma glucose <3mmol/l
- Symptoms: Sweating, anxiety, confusion, seizures, coma
- Treatment:
  - If conscious: Quick-acting carbs (15-20g); recheck in 10-15 min
  - If unconscious: IV glucose or IM glucagon
  
### Management

#### Insulin Therapy
- All T1DM patients require insulin
- Total daily requirement: ~40 units (20 basal, 20 bolus)
- Insulin administration: Subcutaneous via disposable pens
- Insulin types: Ultra-fast, long-acting, premixed options

#### Regimens
- **Basal-Bolus**: Twice-daily insulin detemir recommended for newly diagnosed adults
- **BD Biphasic Regimen**: Twice-daily premixed; regular lifestyle
- **QDS Regimen**: Pre-meal ultra-fast + bedtime long-acting insulin for varied lifestyle
- **Insulin Pump**: For those with poor glycaemic control

#### Adjustments
- Physical activity: 1-2 units decrease per 20-30 min activity
- Illness/stress: Increase dosage as needed
- Surgery: Reduce to 1/3-1/2, monitor closely

### Non-Prescribing Management
- Monitor glycemic control (HbA1C levels, blood glucose)
- Lifestyle measures: Balanced diet, exercise, smoking cessation
- Diet: Low glycaemic index, high fiber; avoid saturated fats/sugar
- Alcohol: Consume carbs before drinking; avoid binge drinking
- Routine monitoring: Annual check-ups for eye, kidney, foot health

### Psychosocial Aspects
- Screen for depression; T1DM is a chronic condition
- Vaccination against pneumococcal diseases is recommended
