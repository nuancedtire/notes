Primary adrenal insufficiency, or Addison’s disease, is characterized by the adrenal glands producing lower levels of adrenocortical hormones (cortisol, aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone). 

### Causes
- Destructive processes affecting adrenal glands
- Conditions interfering with hormone synthesis
- Requires approximately 90% destruction of adrenal cortex to manifest

### Types
- Acute (adrenal crisis)
- Insidious

### Diagnosis Challenges
- Often diagnosed post-adrenal crisis
- Symptoms and signs can be non-specific

#### Common Symptoms:
- Fatigue
- Anorexia
- Weight loss
- Nausea
- Vomiting

#### Common Signs:
- **Hyperpigmentation:** evident in mucosa and sun-exposed areas, notably in palmar creases and scars
- **Hypotension:** systolic BP <110 mmHg
- **Alopecia:** particularly loss of axillary and pubic hair in women

#### Risk Factors:
- Female sex (over 90% are female)
- Positive adrenocortical autoantibodies (50% risk)
- Adrenal hemorrhage (e.g. due to anticoagulants or thromboembolic states)

### Investigations
#### 1st Line:
- **Serum Electrolytes:** Low sodium, high potassium typical
- **Blood Urea:** Elevated levels may indicate Addison’s
- **FBC:** 40% may present with anemia; eosinophilia possible
- **Morning Serum Cortisol:** 
  - Drawn between 8-9 AM
  - <83 nmol/L: suggestive of adrenal insufficiency
  - >497 nmol/L: effectively excludes Addison’s
  - 83-497 nmol/L: requires ACTH stimulation test 

#### Further Investigations:
- **ACTH Stimulation Test:** 
  - Cortisol <497 nmol/L post-stimulation indicates adrenal insufficiency
  - Cortisol >497 nmol/L generally rules out primary adrenal insufficiency
- **Serum ACTH Levels:** 
  - High suggests primary adrenal insufficiency
  - Low suggests secondary adrenal insufficiency
- **Plasma Aldosterone:** 
  - Low levels support Addison's 
- **Adrenal Imaging (CT/MRI):** If etiology unclear

### Addisonian Crisis
#### Aetiology:
- Non-administration of steroids during stress (infection, trauma)
- Long-term steroid patients who miss doses

#### Diagnosis:
- Shock symptoms: increased pulse, vasoconstriction, postural hypotension
- History of Addison’s or long-term steroid use

#### Initial Management:
- Suspected cases treated before test results
- Check cortisol, ACTH, UEs
- Manage high potassium (ECG, calcium gluconate if necessary)
- Administer hydrocortisone 100mg IV stat
- Support BP with IV fluid bolus
- Monitor blood glucose

#### Continual Management:
- Consider IV glucose if hypoglycemic
- Adjust IV fluids as needed
- Continue hydrocortisone 100mg every 8 hours IV or IM
- Transition to oral steroids after 72 hours if stable
- Investigate underlying causes, refer to endocrinology if needed

### Long-term Management
- Lifelong replacement therapy
#### 1st Line Treatment:
- **Glucocorticoids + Mineralocorticoid:**
  - Options: Cortisone, hydrocortisone, prednisolone, fludrocortisone
  - Monitor for excessive replacement causing hypertension, hypokalemia, edema

#### Stress Management:
- Physiological increase in glucocorticoids/mineralocorticoids during stress:
  - Febrile patient: doubled doses
  - Minor procedures: doubled/tripled doses for 3 days
  - Major stress: IV hydrocortisone
  - During pregnancy: increased doses with regular monitoring every 6-8 weeks
