## Overview of Diabetes

- **Prevalence**: 
  - 10% of NHS yearly budget on diabetes treatment.
  - Estimated 5 million people in the UK with diabetes by 2025.
  - Men: 56% of cases; Women: 44%.

## Types of Diabetes Mellitus

1. **Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM)**: ~10% of cases.
2. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)**: ~90% of cases; increasingly affecting younger populations.

## Pathophysiology

- **Diabetes**: Metabolic condition related to insulin production or effectiveness (insulin resistance).
- **T2DM**: Leads to hyperglycemia and potential life-threatening complications; requires lifelong monitoring.

### Classic Symptoms of T2DM

- Polyuria: Frequent urination
- Polydipsia: Excessive thirst
- Polyphagia: Increased appetite
- Fatigue
- Recurrent infections (urinary)
- Asymptomatic or late-stage complications (e.g., skin infections, foot ulcers, diabetic retinopathy, MI/stroke)

## Risk Factors

### Metabolic Syndrome Criteria

- Central obesity (BMI >30) + any two:
  - High triglycerides
  - High blood pressure
  - Low HDL levels
  - High glucose levels

### Other Risk Factors

- Ethnic groups:
  - South Asian: 6x increased risk
  - Afro-Caribbean: 2x increased risk
- Family history

## Diagnosis Criteria

1. Symptoms of hyperglycemia + raised venous glucose levels (single occasion):
   - Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7 mmol/L or random plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L
2. Raised venous glucose on 2 occasions:
   - Same criteria as above or Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (≥ 11.1 mmol/L).
3. HbA1c levels ≥ 48 mmol/L (6.5%).

## Investigations

- Blood tests for glucose.
- Urine dipstick (ketones).
- Metabolic condition tests (LFTs, TFTs, lipid profile, U&Es).

### Blood Test Types

- Fasting plasma glucose: After 8-hour fast.
- Random plasma glucose: Non-fasting.
- Oral glucose tolerance test: 2-hour post-load.
- HbA1c: Represents 3 months of glycemic control.

## Emergency Management

### Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemia State (HHS)

- Presents with very high blood sugar (>30 mmol/L) and high osmolality (>340).
- No significant ketoacidosis.
- Symptoms include severe dehydration.

### Management Steps

1. Rehydrate with 0.9% normal saline (adjust speed based on patient background).
2. Monitor and replace potassium levels.
3. Insulin should be titrated slowly, avoiding a bolus.

## Management (Prescribing)

### First-line Treatments

1. **Metformin**:
   - Increases glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity.
   - Side effects: Gastrointestinal issues, no hypoglycemia.
   - Contraindication: eGFR < 35 ml/min.

2. **SGLT2 Inhibitors** (-flozins):
   - Given alongside Metformin for high cardiovascular risk.
   - Mechanisms: Inhibit glucose resorption, reduce weight and blood pressure.

### Other Drug Options

- **Sulfonylureas** (e.g. Gliclazide): Increase insulin secretion. Side effects: Hypoglycemia, weight gain.
- **Thiazolidinediones** (e.g. Pioglitazone): PPARγ agonists. Side effects: Weight gain, edema, hepatotoxicity.
- **Gliptins** (e.g. Sitagliptin): DPP4 inhibitors. Side effect: Pancreatitis.
- **GLP-1 Analogues** (e.g. Exenatide): Stimulate insulin release. Side effects: GI issues, injection site reactions.
- **Alpha-Glucosidase Inhibitors**: Reduce glucose absorption. Side effects: Bloating, diarrhea.
- **Insulin**: For unmanageable cases with diet and oral agents.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### Lifestyle and Education

- Educate on risk factors and diabetes progression.
- Focus on diet (low sugar, low carbohydrates) and exercise (30 mins, 5x a week).
- Regular follow-ups and checks (eye tests, foot checks, HbA1c, cholesterol, blood pressure).
