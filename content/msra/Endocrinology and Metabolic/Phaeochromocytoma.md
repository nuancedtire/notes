Phaeochromocytomas are tumors originating from catecholamine-secreting chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Most are benign and sporadic, but up to 40% are hereditary (e.g., multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome).

### Diagnosis

- **Clinical Presentation**
  - Asymptomatic in 10-15%, often discovered incidentally.
  - Classic triad:
    - Palpitations
    - Headaches
    - Diaphoresis (excessive sweating)
  - Symptoms episodic, worsening with tumor growth.

- **Examination Findings**
  - Sustained/paroxysmal hypertension (often refractory)
  - Pallor
  - Tremors
  - Tachycardia
  - Abdominal masses

- **Family History**
  - Important, as up to 40% are hereditary:
    - Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes
    - Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease
    - Germline mutations in SDH subunit B, C, and D
    - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)

- **Associated Endocrine Disorders**
  - Cushing syndrome
  - Impaired glucose tolerance
  - Diabetes

### Investigations

- **Initial Biochemical Testing**
  - Patients with classic triad or familial predispositions should be investigated.
  - Low pre-test probability: 24-hour urine collection for catecholamines, metanephrines, normetanephrines, and creatine.
  - High pre-test probability: serum metanephrines and normetanephrines.

- **False Positive Considerations**
  - Clonidine suppression test if indicated (no suppression implies diagnosis).

- **Radiological Evaluation**
  - CT scan of abdomen/pelvis post-biochemical confirmation.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Goal:** Eliminate effects of excessive catecholamine production.
- **Pre-operative Management:**
  - For hypertensive crisis (systolic BP >250 mmHg):
    - Phentolamine (5-20 mg IV), or sodium nitroprusside.
  - For non-crisis:
    - **First line:** Alpha-blockers (phenoxybenzamine)
    - **Secondary:** Doxazosin, prazosin.
  
- **Beta-Blockers:**
  - **First line:** Atenolol, metoprolol, propranolol.
  - **Secondary:** Labetalol.

- **Calcium-Channel Blockers:**
  - **First line:** Nifedipine, amlodipine.
  - **Secondary:** Mertirosine.

- **Chemotherapy:**
  - For surgical candidates or inoperable conditions:
    - Cyclophosphamide
    - Vincristine
    - Dacarbazine.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Surgical Management:**
  - Laparoscopic excision of the adrenal gland is curative (>85%).
  - Adrenal sparing techniques for bilateral involvement.

- **Metastatic Disease:**
  - Surgery/debulking for ~10% with surgical feasibility depending on spread.
  - Consider radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation for hepatic/bone involvement.

- **Hereditary Cases:**
  - Cortical-sparing adrenalectomy preferred to avoid lifelong corticosteroid therapy, with careful postoperative monitoring for recurrence.
