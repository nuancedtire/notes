## Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)

### Overview
- CAH: Inherited enzyme deficiencies causing impaired corticosteroid synthesis in the adrenal cortex.
- Most common deficiency: 21-hydroxylase deficiency (90% of cases).
- Types of CAH:
  - Classical CAH: Simple virilizing & salt-wasting types.
  - Non-classical CAH.
- Other deficiencies: 17-alpha hydroxylase, 11-beta hydroxylase, 3-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

### Diagnosis

#### Classical Simple Virilizing CAH
- **Females**: Diagnosed at birth due to genital ambiguity.
- **Males**: Normal external genitalia; hyperpigmentation may indicate increased ACTH.
- Diagnosis methods: Antenatal or newborn screening; positive family history.
- Signs of hyperandrogenism:
  - Precocious puberty
  - Rapid growth, short stature in adults
  - Infertility, temporal balding, severe acne, hirsutism

#### Classical Salt-Wasting CAH
- Symptoms include renal salt-wasting and hyperandrogenism:
  - Poor feeding, weight loss, failure to thrive
  - Vomiting, dehydration, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia
  - Risk of adrenal crisis at 1-4 weeks of age

#### Non-Classical CAH
- **Positive family history common**.
- Symptoms include:
  - Acne, precocious pubic hair development
  - Accelerated growth, advanced bone age, reduced adult stature
- **Females**: Normal genitalia at birth; symptoms may include hirsutism and menstrual irregularities.
- **Males**: Early beard growth, enlarged phallus, short stature, diminished fertility.

### Investigations
1. **ACTH Stimulation Test**: Diagnose 21-hydroxylase deficiency; levels remain high.
2. **Serum 17-Hydroprogesterone**: Elevated in classical form.
3. **Serum 11-Deoxycortisol**: Marker for 11-beta-hydroxylase deficiency; elevated results.
4. **Serum Chemistry**: Check for hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis.
5. **Genetic Analysis**: Recommended with a family history or affected parents.

### Management (Prescribing)

#### Chronic Management
- **Glucocorticoid Replacement Therapy**: Commonly hydrocortisone; corrects cortisol deficiency and suppresses ACTH production.
- **Mineralocorticoid (Fludrocortisone)**: Required for salt-wasting forms; sodium chloride therapy may be needed post-infancy.
- **Growth Hormone Therapy**: For short stature; effective in improving final height.
- **Precocious Puberty Treatment**: LH-releasing hormone analogues.

#### Acute Management
- Increase glucocorticoid dose (2-3 times normal) during stress (surgery, infections).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Feminizing Genitoplasty**: For virilized females at birth; aims to remove erectile tissue and construct functioning vagina.
