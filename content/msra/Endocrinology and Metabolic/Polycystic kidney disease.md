## Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)

**Types of PKD:**
- Autosomal Recessive (ARPKD)
- Autosomal Dominant (ADPKD) â€“ The more common form

### Diagnosis
**Common Symptoms:**
- **Hypertension**
  - Affects nearly all patients, often precedes renal function issues.
  - Detectable in ages 20-34 before other symptoms.
- **Abdominal/Flank Pain**
  - Caused by nephrolithiasis, infection, hemorrhage, or UTIs.
- **Haematuria**
  - Both macro and microscopic types.
- **Dysuria, Urgency, Suprapubic Pain, Fever**
  - 50-70% of patients experience at least one UTI in their lifetime.

**Strong Risk Factors:**
- Family history of ADPKD or end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
- Family history of cerebrovascular events.

**Common Examination Findings:**
- Palpable kidneys/abdominal mass.
- Cardiac murmurs (mitral valve prolapse/regurgitation, [[aortic regurgitation]]).
- Abdominal hernia or rectus abdominis diastasis.
- Hepatomegaly (often asymptomatic; increases with age).

### Investigations
**1st Line Investigations:**
- **Renal Ultrasound** (age-dependent cyst counts).
- **CT Scan** if ultrasound unclear (criteria based on age and family history).
- **MRI** if ultrasound unclear (criteria: >10 cysts/kidney).
- **Urinalysis/Gram Stain** for UTI symptoms.
- **Serum Electrolytes, Urea, Creatinine** (normal or elevated).
- **Fasting Lipid Levels** (normal or elevated).
- **ECG** for cardiac issues.

**Consider:**
- **Genetic Testing** (PKD1, PKD2 mutations).
- **KUB X-ray** for renal calcification if symptomatic.

**Urinalysis** is recommended for all patients to check urinary albumin.

### Management (Prescribing)
**Goals:**
- Prolong life and delay renal failure.

**Hypertension:**
- **1st Line:** Captopril, Enalapril, Perindopril, etc.
- **2nd Line:** Labetalol, Carvedilol.
- **3rd Line:** Metoprolol, Hydrochlorothiazide, etc.

**Urinary Tract Infections:**
- **1st Line:** Antibiotics per culture.

**Infected Renal Cyst:**
- **1st Line:** Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin; Tertiary: Chloramphenicol.

**Renal Pain:**
- **1st Line:** Investigate and treat causes.
- **Adjunct:** Supportive care.
- **2nd Line:** Analgesia if no reversible cause.

**Nephrolithiasis:**
- **1st Line:** Analgesia.

**Polycystic Liver Disease:**
- **Asymptomatic:** Monitoring; avoid cAMP-raising drugs.
- **Symptomatic:** Antibiotics for infections.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
**Hypertension:**
- **1st Line Adjunct:** Lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, weight management).

**Infected Renal Cyst:**
- **1st Line Adjunct:** Cyst drainage if unresponsive to antibiotics.
- **2nd Line:** Nephrectomy for recurrent infections.

**Renal Pain:**
- **3rd Line:** Surgical intervention for complications.
- **4th Line:** Nephrectomy as a last resort.

**Nephrolithiasis:**
- **2nd Line:** Surgical options (ESWL, nephrolithotomy).

**Polycystic Liver Disease:**
- **Symptomatic Non-Infected:** Surgical reduction of cyst volume.

**End-Stage Renal Disease:**
- **1st Line:** Renal transplant (preferably from living donor).
- **2nd Line:** Dialysis (hemodialysis preferred due to kidney size contraindications for peritoneal).
