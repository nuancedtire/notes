## Cataract Overview

- **Definition**: Progressive opacification of the eyeâ€™s lens, causing gradual and painless visual changes.
- **Prevalence**: Common and leading cause of blindness worldwide.

## Diagnosis

- **Classification**:
  - **By Age**:
    - Presenile
    - Senile (age-related, most common)
  - **By Morphology**:
    - Nuclear
    - Cortical
    - Lamellar
    - Subcapsular

- **Causes of Presenile Cataracts**:
  - Congenital
  - Ocular trauma
  - Eye diseases (e.g. anterior uveitis, angle-closure glaucoma)
  - Systemic diseases (e.g. diabetes, neurofibromatosis type 2, myotonic dystrophy)
  - Medications (e.g. steroids)

- **Symptoms**:
  - Reduced visual acuity
  - Glare
  - Halos around lights
  - Congenital cataract may lead to irreversible visual impairment if untreated.

## Examination and Investigations

- **Visual Acuity Test**: e.g. Snellen chart.
- **Leukocoria**: May lead to lost red reflex on **direct ophthalmoscopy**; important in newborn screening.
- **Slit-lamp Examination**: Assesses lens opacity.
- **Optical Biometry**: Measures axial length of eyes for intraocular lens implants.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Cataract Surgery**: Only treatment that halts progression with high success and low complication rates.
  
- **Postoperative Complications**:
  - Posterior Capsule Opacification (10%)
  - Endophthalmitis (1 in 1,000)
  - Retinal Detachment/Tear (1 in 1,000)
  - Choroidal Hemorrhage (1 in 1,000)
  - Posterior Capsule Rupture

- **Referral Guidance**:
  - Urgent referral for infants with suspected cataracts.
  - Routine referral for adults if cataract impacts quality of life or visual acuity is worse than 6/6 in either eye.

- **Support for Non-Surgical Patients**: Visual aids are recommended but do not prevent or halt cataract progression.

*Note: Referral criteria and surgery thresholds may vary among different NHS Trusts.*
