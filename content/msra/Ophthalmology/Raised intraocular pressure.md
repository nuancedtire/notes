## Raised Intraocular Pressure (Ocular Hypertension)

- Elevated eye pressure (10-21 mmHg)
- Key components: aqueous and vitreous humour

### Diagnosis

- **Ocular Hypertension Criteria**:
  - Intraocular pressure > 21 mmHg
  - Normal visual fields
  - Normal optic disc appearance
  - No transient intraocular pressure elevation from other eye diseases (e.g., infections)

- **Glaucoma Association**:
  - Glaucoma not dependent on high intraocular pressure.
  - Defined by optic nerve head cupping.

- **Monitoring**:
  - Increased risk of developing glaucoma.

### Investigations

NICE recommendations for investigations:
1. Goldmann tonometry
2. Corneal thickness measurement
3. Gonioscopy (anterior chamber configuration)
4. Perimetry (visual field defects)
5. Slit-lamp assessment (optic nerve and fundus)

### Management (Prescribing)

- **General Approach**: Treatment often not required for mild cases.
- **Referral**: Based on age, IOP, corneal thickness, signs of glaucoma.

- **Medications**:
  1. **Prostaglandin analogues** (e.g., latanoprost)
     - Increases uveoscleral outflow
     - Side effects: brown iris pigmentation, longer eyelashes
  2. **Beta-blockers** (e.g., timolol)
     - Reduces aqueous secretion
     - Contraindications: asthma, bradycardia, heart block
     - Side effects: irritation, dry eyes
  3. **Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors** (e.g., dorzolamide)
     - Reduces aqueous secretion
     - Side effects: discomfort, lacrimation, keratitis
  4. **Sympathomimetics** (e.g., apraclonidine)
     - Reduces secretion and increases outflow
     - Side effects: mydriasis, dry eyes
  5. **Miotics** (e.g., pilocarpine)
     - Increases drainage via trabecular meshwork
     - Side effects: miosis, blurred vision, brow ache

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Surgical Options**: Not recommended for isolated ocular hypertension; reserved for glaucoma.
- **Patient Advice**:
  - Adherence to treatment is crucial to prevent vision loss.
  - Use of eye drop dispensers for those with physical limitations.
  - Lacrimal occlusion: close eyes for 3 mins post-instillation to minimize systemic absorption.
  - Blotting excess drops reduces local skin irritation.
