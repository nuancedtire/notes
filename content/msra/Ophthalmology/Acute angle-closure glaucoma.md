- **Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma:** 
  - Ophthalmological emergency from blocked aqueous outflow, leading to increased intraocular pressure (IOP).
  - Symptoms:
    - Painful red eye
    - Blurred vision
    - Halo effect around lights
    - Nausea
    - Headache
    - Dilated pupil (on examination)

- **Emergency Referral:** 
  - Patients with suspicion should be urgently referred to a specialist eye unit.

- **Immediate Management:**
  - Pilocarpine eye drops (constrict pupil)
  - Intravenous acetazolamide
  - Analgesia
  - Anti-emetics

- **Definitive Management:** 
  - Surgical intervention required after IOP controls.

- **Diagnosis:**
  - Clinical diagnosis based on symptoms (painful red eye).
  - Supportive findings: Red eye, reduced visual acuity, fixed dilated pupil.
  - Urgent referral for confirmatory assessments.

- **Investigations:**
  - Initial: Fundoscopy and slit-lamp examination.
  - Confirmatory: Tonometry (IOP > 21mmHg), typical fundoscopy findings (large optic cup, nerve damage).
  - Gold-standard: Gonioscopy for anterior chamber viewing.
  - Optical coherence tomography for uncertain cases.

- **Management (Prescribing):**
  - Initiate immediate pharmacological treatment:
    - Pilocarpine eye drops
    - Oral/acetalazolamide (also IV in acute settings)
    - Analgesia and anti-emetics for symptoms
  - Positioning: Lying flat to reduce IOP.
  - For persistent high IOP: Hyperosmotic agents (IV mannitol).
  - Outside acute setting: Prostaglandin analogues (e.g., latanoprost) for raised IOP.

- **Management (Non-Prescribing):**
  - Surgical options:
    - **Laser iridotomy:** Procedure to create a hole in the iris.
    - **Laser iridoplasty:** Contracting iris via laser cauterization.
    - **Iridectomy:** Removal of small iris section.
  - For chronic cases: Trabeculectomy or aqueous humour shunts.
