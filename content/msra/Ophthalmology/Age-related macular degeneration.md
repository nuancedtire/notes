- **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
  - Most common blindness cause in the UK.
  - Affects central vision, impacting face recognition, reading, and TV watching.
  - Occurs mainly in individuals aged 50-60+. 

- **Risk Factors**
  - Smoking
  - Hypertension
  - Obesity
  - Family history

- **Diagnosis**
  - Symptoms: Blurred/distorted vision, central vision loss.
  - No associated pain or visible eye changes.
  - Fundoscopy findings: 
    - Drusen (yellow-white deposits) indicate severity.
    - New vessel growth in wet AMD leads to leakage and fluid.
  - Diagnosis:
    - Dry AMD: Drusen + central sight loss without wet features.
    - Wet AMD: New blood vessels present.
  - Amsler grids used for monitoring (wavy/missing lines).

- **Investigations**
  - Initial: Slit lamp fundoscopy.
  - Fundal photography for monitoring disease progression.
  - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) for suspected wet AMD; fluorescein fundal angiography if uncertain.

- **Cardiovascular Screening**
  - AMD's association with cardiovascular risk factors may necessitate cardiovascular disease screening in asymptomatic individuals.

- **Management (Prescribing)**
  - No treatments for dry AMD.
  - Wet AMD: Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (e.g., ranibizumab) as first-line treatment.

- **Management (Non-Prescribing)**
  - Supportive care for dry AMD: Visual aids, education, monitoring.
  - Referral for wet AMD patients.
  - Information on registering as sight impaired and available support services.
  - Support groups are available.
  - Photodynamic therapy as a second-line option for wet AMD.
