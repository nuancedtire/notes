## Horner’s Syndrome Overview

- **Definition**: Horner’s syndrome results from damage to the sympathetic nervous supply to the eye.
- **Pathway**: Originates in the hypothalamus, travels via the brainstem and cervical spinal cord to the T1 nerve root, then follows the carotid artery to the eye.
- **Importance**: Recognition is crucial due to its association with various serious pathologies.

### Diagnosis

**Causes of Horner’s Syndrome**:

| Area of Affected Pathway                      | Pathology                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

| **T1 nerve root**                            | - Pancoast tumour (apical lung tumour)        |
|                                               | - Cervical rib                                 |
|                                               | - Brachial plexus trauma (e.g., birth)       |
| **Sympathetic chain/carotid artery in neck**| - Post-surgery (carotid artery, thyroid, etc.)|
|                                               | - Carotid artery dissection                    |
|                                               | - Malignant tumour                             |
| **Other**                                     | - Congenital                                   |
|                                               | - Idiopathic                                   |
|                                               | - Cluster headache (usually resolves hours)   |
|                                               | - Otitis media and herpes zoster in ear       |
|                                               | - Neuroblastoma (children, new-onset)        |

**Characteristics**: 
- Ptosis
- Unilateral miosis (normal light reflex)
- Lack of sweating on ipsilateral side
- Possible headaches, facial pain/flushing, lighter iris pigmentation (if congenital)

### Investigations

1. **History**: Focus on pain, trauma, surgery, and examine for other cranial nerve involvement.
2. **Confirmation**: Use apraclonidine eye drops; dilation after 1 hour indicates Horner’s syndrome.

**Investigations to determine cause**:
- MRI of brain/spinal cord (suspected central pathology)
- CXR/CT thorax (for Pancoast tumor)
- Carotid Doppler (dissection/tumor)
- MRI neck (thyroid tumor, cervical lymph nodes) and lymph node biopsy

- **Approach**: Based on underlying cause.
