## Glaucoma Overview

- **Definition**: Group of eye conditions damaging the optic nerve, leading to retinal ganglion cell loss.

### Open-Angle Glaucoma (OAG)

- **Subset**: Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Adult-onset, painless, progressive vision loss
  - Intraocular pressure > 21 mmHg (normal: 10-21 mmHg)
  - Glaucomatous optic neuropathy
  - Peripheral visual field loss before central loss
  - No underlying cause
  - Typically affects both eyes

### Risk Factors for POAG

- Increasing age (rare <40, common >65)
- Family history
- Race (more common in Afro-Caribbean)
- Ocular hypertension
- Myopia (hypermetropia increases angle-closure risk)
- Retinal diseases (e.g., central retinal vein occlusion)
- Microvascular diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes)

### Diagnosis

- Based on clinical history and examination findings.

### Investigations (NICE Guidelines)

1. Goldmann tonometry (intraocular pressure measurement)
2. Corneal thickness measurement
3. Gonioscopy (assess iridocorneal angle)
4. Perimetry (detect visual field defects)
5. Slit-lamp assessment (optic nerve and fundus examination)
   - Increased cupping (normal cup-to-disc ratio: 0.3)
   - Optical coherence tomography for cup-to-disc ratio measurements.

### Management (Prescribing)

- Begin with one drug at a time:
  1. **Prostaglandin analogues (e.g., latanoprost)**: First-line; increases outflow; side effects: brown iris pigmentation, longer eyelashes.
  2. **Beta-blockers (e.g., timolol)**: Reduces secretion; contraindicated in asthma/bradycardia; side effects: irritation, dry eyes.
  3. **Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., dorzolamide)**: Reduces secretion; side effects: lacrimation, discomfort.
  4. **Sympathomimetics (e.g., apraclonidine)**: Reduces secretion and increases outflow; side effects: mydriasis, dry eyes.
  5. **Miotics (e.g., pilocarpine)**: Increases drainage; side effects: miosis, blurred vision.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Laser Treatments**: Consider after two unsuccessful pharmacological trials.
  - Laser trabeculoplasty enhances uveoscleral outflow.
  
- **Surgical Treatments**: Typical intervention is surgical trabeculectomy.
  - Creates a fistula between the anterior chamber and sub-tenon space.
