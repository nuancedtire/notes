- **Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: Most common cause of blindness in the UK, leading to central sight loss.
  - **Symptoms**: Difficulty visualizing faces, reading, watching TV.

    - Characteristics: Drusen deposits (yellow-white), absence of wet AMD features.
    - Diagnosis: Presence of drusen with progressive central sight loss.
    - Treatment: No medical or surgical options; management is supportive (visual aids, education, monitoring).
  
  - **Wet AMD**:
    - Characteristics: Faster progression, greater risk of sight loss, new blood vessel growth on retina leading to leakage.
    - Treatment: 
      - Anti-VEGF injections to prevent new blood vessel growth.
      - Photodynamic therapy for severe cases.
