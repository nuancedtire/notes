## Myopia Overview
- Myopia (short-sightedness) results in blurry distant vision but clear near vision.
- Causes: 
  - Over-refraction by the lens.
  - Elongation of the eyeball.

### Natural Progression
- Develops primarily between ages 6-13 but can occur in adults.
- Tends to plateau after age 20.
- No established method to slow progression.

## Diagnosis
- Affects 1/3 of adults; clinical suspicion if a child:
  - Needs to sit in front of the classroom.
  - Sits too close to the TV.
  - Rubs eyes frequently.
  - Complains of headaches or tired eyes.
- If suspected, advise an appointment with an optician.

## Investigations
- Visual acuity testing is the primary diagnostic tool.
- Electronic images may be used for additional parameters.
- Assess blurriness with Snellenâ€™s chart; corrective lenses determine the degree of error.
- Myopia corrected with concave lenses.
- Untreated myopia may lead to lazy eye or squint.
- Increased risks: open-angle glaucoma, cataracts, retinal detachment - further investigation needed if symptoms arise.

## Management
### Prescribing
- No medications indicated for treatment.

### Non-Prescribing Treatment Options
1. **Glasses**: 
   - Cheapest and safest; use concave lenses to correct over-focusing.
2. **Contact Lenses**: 
   - Similar function to glasses but require more care and can have complications (keratitis, corneal ulcers).
3. **Corrective Surgery**: 
   - Options: LASIK, LASEK, PRK.
   - Benefits: Can improve or restore vision.
   - Risks: Hazy vision, night blindness, contraindicated in pregnancy, diabetes, immunocompromised patients.
4. **Artificial Lens Implant**: 
   - New technique; inserts lens directly into the eye; not available on NHS.
