Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic retinal complication from diabetes mellitus caused by microvascular issues. It has two main categories:

1. **Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR)**: Less advanced, earlier stage.
2. **Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)**: More advanced, sight-threatening.

### Screening and Management
- A national screening program in the UK uses annual digital retinal photography for early identification of at-risk patients.
- Management includes optimizing DR risk factors and treatments such as intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF or laser photocoagulation for PDR.

### Diagnosis
- DR develops from long-term hyperglycaemia; it's rarely present at diabetes diagnosis.
- Incidence after 15 years: 90% in type 1 diabetes, 60% in type 2 diabetes.
- Symptoms may include floaters or vision loss due to macular oedema or vitreous haemorrhage.

### Classification of DR
- **Mild NPDR**: Haemorrhages (dot/blot) or microaneurysms.
- **Moderate NPDR**: Severe retinal haemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, hard exudates, venous beading, IRMA.
- **Severe NPDR**: Severe retinal haemorrhages in all quadrants, venous beading in two quadrants, extensive IRMA.
- **PDR**: New vessels on the disc or retina, iris neovascularisation indicates severe PDR; complications include vitreous haemorrhage and retinal detachment.

### Investigations
- **Digital retinal photography**: Basis of the screening program.
- **Fluorescein angiography**: Guides laser treatment.
- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)**: Detects macular oedema.

### Management (non-prescribing)
- Prevent DR progression by optimizing glycaemia, lipids, and hypertension.
- All diabetes patients aged 12+ receive annual dilated fundus exams, shifting to every two years for low-risk individuals.

| Grade (traditional)       | Follow-up                                   | Treatment                |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| None/background            | Regular screening                           | No                       |
| Pre-proliferative         | Routine referral to ophthalmology           | Consider PRP*            |
| Proliferative (PDR)       | Urgent referral to ophthalmology (<2 weeks)| PRP Anti-VEGF            |

* PRP = pan-retinal laser photocoagulation

### Management (treatments)
- **Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF**: Common for PDR.
- **Pan-retinal laser photocoagulation**: Destroys ischaemic retinal tissue, reduces VEGF.
- **Intravitreal corticosteroid therapy**: For refractory cases.
- **Vitrectomy surgery**: Addresses vitreous haemorrhage or retinal traction.
