### Acute Iritis Overview
- Also called: Anterior uveitis
- Affects: Uvea (iris, ciliary body, choroid)
  - Anterior uveitis: Iris and ciliary body inflamed
  - Posterior uveitis: Choroid inflammation
  - Pan-uveitis: All parts inflamed

### Symptoms
- Painful red eye
- Blurred vision
- Photophobia
- Excessive lacrimation
- Reduced visual acuity

### Differential Diagnosis
- Acute angle-closure glaucoma
- Conjunctivitis

### Causes
- Autoimmune/inflammatory conditions:
  - Ankylosing spondylitis
  - Sarcoidosis
  - Inflammatory bowel disease
- Infectious agents:
  - HIV
  - Tuberculosis
  - Syphilis
  - Herpes
- Most often idiopathic
- Association with genotype HLA-B27

### Diagnosis
- Characterized by:
  - Symptoms developing in hours to days (usually unilateral)
  - Absence of discharge (contrasts with conjunctivitis)
  - Regular eye examination needed:
    - Visual acuity, visual fields, pupillary light response, fundi assessment
    - Slit lamp used to visualize corneal precipitates
- Referral to ophthalmology for formal diagnosis
- Talbot’s test: Increased pain during gaze convergence indicates iritis

### Investigations
- No specific tests for diagnosis, but:
  - Fundoscopy and slit-lamp examinations conducted
  - Laboratory tests may be indicated for underlying causes:
    - Inflammatory disease screens
    - Rheumatological assays
    - Chest x-rays (associated conditions like tuberculosis, sarcoidosis)
    - HLA-B27 testing if recurrent or bilateral cases

### Management (Prescribing)
- Predominantly medical:
  - Topical steroid drops (0.5-1% prednisolone) for inflammation and pain
  - Cyclopentolate 0.5% eye drops to dilate pupil
- Latanoprost eye drops: For raised intraocular pressure
- Treatment duration: Minimum of six weeks for complete resolution

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Regular outpatient reviews to monitor inflammation
- Watch for complications such as glaucoma and cataracts
- Educate patients on disease natural history, recurrence potential, and driving restrictions with visual impairment
