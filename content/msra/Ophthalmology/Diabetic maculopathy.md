## Diabetic Maculopathy

### Overview
- Also known as diabetic macular oedema.
- Complication of diabetic retinopathy.
- Can lead to loss of central vision if untreated.

### Diagnosis
- Associated with both non-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
- Classifications identifiable via slit-lamp examination:
  - **Focal**: Areas of leakage around microaneurysms.
  - **Diffuse**: More widespread edema.
  - **Ischaemic**: Reduced visual acuity with normal findings; detectable macular ischaemia.
  - **Clinically significant macular oedema**: Thickening and/or hard exudates in the macula.

### Investigations
- **Fundus fluorescein angiography**
- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)**

### Management
- Similar to diabetic retinopathy management.
- Prevention through controlling systemic risk factors (glycaemic, lipid, hypertensive) and annual screenings for diabetic retinopathy and maculopathy.
  
#### Treatment for Clinically Significant Macular Oedema
1. **Intravitreal VEGF Inhibitors**
   - e.g. ranibizumab, aflibercept (1st line treatment).
   - Potential complications: endophthalmitis, vitreous haemorrhage, retinal tears/detachment.
   
2. **Laser Photocoagulation**
   - Potential complications: subretinal fibrosis, scars extending into fovea, scotoma.
   
3. **Combined Therapy**
   - Laser + intravitreal VEGF or corticosteroid.
