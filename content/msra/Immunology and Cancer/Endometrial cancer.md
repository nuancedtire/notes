- **Overview:**
  - Endometrial cancer is the 5th most common cancer in women (after breast, lung, colon, skin).
  - 90% of cases are adenocarcinomas:
    - **Type I:** oestrogen-dependent (endometrioid carcinoma), favorable prognosis.
    - **Type II:** oestrogen-independent (non-endometrioid carcinoma), less common, more aggressive.

- **Diagnosis:**
  - Most affected: women over 50 (median age: 63).
  - New cases in the UK: ~8,600/year.
  - Common symptoms:
    - Postmenopausal bleeding
    - Irregular menstrual cycle:
      - Heavy bleeding
      - Bleeding between periods
      - Vaginal discharge
  - Symptoms of disseminated cancer:
    - Increased abdominal circumference (ascites/ovarian cysts)
    - Pain (due to organ impact)
    - Shortness of breath (lung metastases)
    - Fatigue

- **Risk Factors:**
  - Long unopposed oestrogen exposure
  - Menopause after age 52
  - High BMI
  - Nulliparity
  - Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC): 30-60% lifetime risk
  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
  - Diabetes
  - Tamoxifen treatment

- **Investigations:**
  - Gynecological exam (looking for blood/tissue)
  - Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)
  - Endometrial biopsy (via outpatient hysteroscopy)
  - Hysteroscopy (preferred for diagnostic accuracy)
  - Cancer antigen 125 (CA-125)
  - CT scan 
  - Chest X-ray
  - Full blood count (FBC) and liver function tests (LFTs)
  - Pregnancy test (for women of childbearing age)

- **Staging (FIGO):**
  - **Stage I:** Carcinoma confined to corpus uteri.
    - IA: Endometrium only.
    - IB: Myometrium involvement.
  - **Stage II:** Involvement of cervical stroma, still within uterus.
  - **Stage III:** Spread beyond uterus.
    - IIIA: Serosa/adnexa involvement.
    - IIIB: Para-metrial/vaginal metastases.
    - IIIC: Pelvic/para-aortic lymph nodes.
  - **Stage IV:** Invasion of bowel/bladder or distant metastases.
    - IVA: Bowel/bladder mucosa.
    - IVB: Distant metastases.
  - Most patients diagnosed at advanced stages (FIGO III-IV).

- **Management (Prescribing):**
  - Treatment based on FIGO stage; surgery is often necessary.
  - Fertility preservation: progestogen for stage IA.

- **Management (Non-prescribing):**
  - **Stage I:** Total abdominal hysterectomy + bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
  - **Stage II:** Radical hysterectomy + systemic pelvic lymph node clearance.
  - **Stages III/IV:** Debulking surgery + radiation/chemotherapy.
  - If surgery isn't an option: external beam/intracavity radiotherapy.
  - Some may need adjuvant radiotherapy; most treated with surgery alone.
