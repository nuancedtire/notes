## Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Overview 

- **Increasing Incidence**:
  - ~3:100,000 in high-income countries
  - Up to 78:100,000 in some Asian/African countries
  - Higher rates attributed to HCV & HBV infections leading to chronic liver disease.

- **Risk Factors for Chronic Liver Disease**:
  - Intravenous drug use (anabolic steroids)
  - Aflatoxins
  - Excessive alcohol intake
  - Obesity
  - Diabetes
  - Hypertension

- **HCC Prevalence**:
  - 90% of primary liver cancers.

## Diagnosis

### Signs & Symptoms of Chronic Liver Disease:
- Jaundice
- Ascites
- Encephalopathy
- Bleeding
- Splenomegaly

### Additional Signs & Symptoms of Liver Tumours:
- Fever
- Malaise
- Anorexia
- Weight loss
- Abdominal mass

### Screening:
- **Patients**: Liver cirrhosis, chronically infected with HCV or HBV 
- **Methods**: 
  - Abdominal ultrasound
  - Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) every 6 months.

### Diagnosis Confirmation:
- Histopathological analysis or imaging criteria (CT/MRI) in cirrhosis patients.

## Staging (TNM Classification)

- **T (Tumour)**:
  - TX: Cannot be assessed
  - T0: No evidence of primary tumour
  - T1: Solitary tumour â‰¤2 cm
  - T1b: Solitary tumour >2 cm
  - T2: Solitary tumour with vascular invasion or multiple tumours (none >5 cm)
  - T3: Multiple tumours, at least one >5 cm
  - T4: Tumours involving portal/hepatic vein or adjacent organ invasion.

- **N (Regional Lymph Nodes)**:
  - NX: Cannot be assessed
  - N0: No metastasis
  - N1: Metastasis present 

- **M (Distant Metastasis)**:
  - M0: None
  - M1: Present

## Investigations

- **Clinical Examination**: Risk factors, signs of chronic liver disease, weight loss.
- **Laboratory Tests**: 
  - HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HCV (aetiology)
  - Prothrombin, albumin, bilirubin, full blood count (liver function)
  - Serum AFP (tumour marker; elevated in 50-80% of cases)
- **Imaging**: MRI/CT for diagnosis and extent assessment.
- **Tumour Biopsy**: Confirmatory, not needed for cirrhosis with typical imaging.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **HBV Prevention**: 
  - Vaccination for all children (3 doses at 0, 1, 6 months).

- **Treatment for HCC**:
  - **Tumour <3 cm with preserved liver function**: Surgical resection, thermal ablation, liver transplant (70% 5-year survival).
  - **Advanced Stages**: Transarterial chemoembolization, stereotactic body radiotherapy, brachytherapy, selective internal radiotherapy, systemic chemotherapy (Sorafenib, Lenvatinib), and immunotherapy (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab).

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Address Treatable Causes**: 
  - Ensure appropriate treatment for chronic liver disease.
- **Lifestyle Advice**:
  - Limit or avoid alcohol.
  - Dietary and lifestyle changes for metabolic syndrome patients.
