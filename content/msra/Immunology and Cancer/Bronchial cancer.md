#### **Types of Lung Cancer Affecting Bronchi/Bronchioles:**

- **Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC):**
  - Strongly associated with smoking; risk factors include radon gas, asbestos.
  - Usually develops near main bronchi.
  - More aggressive; poorer prognosis than NSCLC; fast growth and metastasis; high recurrence rate.

- **Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC):**
  - **Adenocarcinoma:** starts in mucus-producing cells.
  - **Squamous Cell Carcinoma:** starts in flat cells; associated with smoking.
  - **Large Cell Carcinoma**
  - **Bronchial Carcinoid**

- **Common Metastasis Locations:** Liver, bone, brain.

#### **Staging (TNM System):**

- **Stage 1:**
  - 1A: Tumour <3cm, no lymph node invasion (T1a-c, N0, M0).
  - 1B: Tumour 3-4cm, no lymph node invasion (T2a, N0, M0).

- **Stage 2:**
  - 2A: Tumour 4-5cm, no lymph node invasion (T2b, N0, M0).
  - 2B: Up to 5cm with nearby lymph node invasion or 5-7cm, no invasion.

- **Stage 3:**
  - 3A: Tumour <7cm with central chest lymph nodes or spread to chest wall.
  - 3B: Tumour <5cm with distant lymph node invasion, any size with chest invasion.
  - 3C: Tumour >7cm with extensive spread and complications.

- **Stage 4:**
  - 4A: Cancer in both lungs or spread to pleura or lymph nodes outside the chest (M1a).
  - 4B: Extensive spread to multiple organs (M1c).

#### **Diagnosis:**

- **Symptoms:**
  - Persistent cough, haemoptysis, shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss, [[chest pain]], dysphagia.

- **Signs:**
  - Regular infections, clubbing, wheezing, hoarseness.

- **Paraneoplastic Syndrome Symptoms:**
  - Increased cortisol, ADH, autoantibodies, parathyroid hormone levels.

- **Carcinoid Syndrome Symptoms:**
  - Increased serotonin, diarrhoea, flushing, wheezing, palpitations, abdominal pain.

- **Investigations:**
  - Chest X-ray, CT scans, biopsy, sputum cytology, thoracentesis, 24-hour urine collection for carcinoid syndrome.

#### **Screening:**
- Annual low-dose CT for ages 55-74 with a high smoking history.

#### **Management (Prescribing):**

- **SCLC:**
  - Chemotherapy (cisplatin/carboplatin + etoposide); radiotherapy; prophylactic cranial irradiation.

- **NSCLC:**
  - Neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy; chemoradiation for unresectable cases; Durvalumab for unresectable stage 3a; Octreotide for carcinoid syndrome.

#### **Management (Non-Prescribing):**

- **SCLC:**
  - Rarely resectable; prioritises radiotherapy and smoking cessation.

- **NSCLC:**
  - Surgery first-line for resectable cases (stages 1-3).
