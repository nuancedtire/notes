## Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)

- **Definition**: Primary neoplasm from the renal cortex, most common type of primary renal cancer (80%).

### **Symptoms**
- **Classical Symptoms**:
  - Abdominal mass
  - Flank pain
  - Haematuria
  - Weight loss
- **Incidental Diagnosis**: Often found during tests for other reasons.
- **Advanced Disease at Diagnosis**: Approximately 25% have advanced disease (distant metastases/local spread).
- **Symptoms of Spread**: Involvement of inferior vena cava, hepatic, and bone symptoms.

### **Diagnosis**
- **Incidental Findings**: Increased use of abdominal CT and ultrasound.
- **Suggestive Symptoms**:
  - Flank Pain
  - Weight Loss
  - Abdominal Swelling/Masses
  - Haematuria
  - Changes in Renal Function
  - Other malignant disease symptoms.

### **Investigations**
- **Primary Imaging**: Abdominal CT scan to detect masses (not fully diagnostic).
- **Adjunctive Investigations**: Abdominal ultrasound (distinguishes mass types: tumor, simple cysts, complex cysts).
- **MRI**: Useful if CT is unsuitable, helps assess invasion into renal structures.
- **Definitive Diagnosis**: Biopsy of metastases or nephrectomy and tissue sampling for TNM staging and management guidance.

### **Management (Prescribing)**
- **Guided by TNM Staging**:
  - **Simple Disease**: Surgery is the only definitive treatment (curative if fully resected).
  - **Advanced Disease**: Complex management options include:
    - Immunotherapy
    - Chemotherapy
    - Biologic Agents
    - Radiotherapy
    - Metastatic Debulking Surgery
    - Surgery in specific cases.

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- **Active Surveillance**: Monitoring for disease progression in high-risk patients with uncomplicated disease; limited approved adjuvant therapies.
