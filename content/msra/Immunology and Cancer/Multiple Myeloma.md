Myeloma Overview
-----------------

- **Definition**: Haematological malignancy of plasma cells in bone marrow.
- **Terminology**: 
  - **Multiple Myeloma**: Disease at multiple sites; also called myeloma.
  - **Solitary Myeloma**: Myeloma localized to one site, termed solitary plasmacytoma.
  
### Epidemiology
- **Age**: Rare under 40; median presentation is over 60.
- **Gender**: More common in men.
- **Ethnicity**: More common in individuals of black-African descent; less common in those of Asian descent.

### Pathophysiology
- **Plasma Cells Function**: Primary antibody-producing cells.
- **Overproduction of Paraproteins**: Non-functional monoclonal antibodies or fragments (M proteins).
  - **Bence Jones Proteins**: Specific monoclonal fragments found in urine, indicative of renal dysfunction.

### Plasma Cell Dyscrasias
- Spectrum of disorders with pre-malignant or malignant plasma cells; progresses from pre-malignant forms to multiple myeloma.

### Diagnosis (CRAB Criteria)
- **C**: Hypercalcaemia
  - Increased osteoclast activity leads to bone resorption and elevated calcium.
- **R**: Renal Dysfunction
  - Caused by nephrocalcinosis or paraprotein deposition; poor prognosis.
- **A**: Anaemia
  - Reduced erythropoiesis from overcrowded bone marrow; findings include normocytic, normochromic anaemia.
- **B**: Bone Pain
  - Caused by myeloma cells activity; visualized as lytic lesions.

### Other Presenting Features
- Night sweats
- Weight loss
- Unexplained bleeding/bruising
- Recurrent infections
- Splenomegaly
- Signs of paraprotein deposition (e.g., macroglossia, renal failure signs, arrhythmias).

### Risk Factors
- Previous **MGUS** (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance).
- Abnormal free light-chain ratio in context of MGUS.

### Investigations
- **Suspect Myeloma If**:
  - Leukopenia or Anaemia on FBC
  - Rouleaux formation on blood film
  - Hypercalcaemia
  - Raised Plasma Viscosity or ESR
- **Urgent Tests for ≥ 60 years**: Serum protein electrophoresis and urine Bence-Jones test within 48 hours.
- **Confirm Diagnosis**: 
  - Whole-body imaging (MRI preferred) to identify myeloma lesions.
  - Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy showing ≥ 10% monoclonal plasma cell infiltration.

### Management (Prescribing)
- Treatment needed only for symptomatic disease; asymptomatic cases may be monitored.
- Treatment aims:
  - Induce remission
  - Prolong lifespan
  - Maintain quality of life
- Treatment options include:
  - Chemotherapy
  - Steroids
  - Thalidomide
- **Complications Management**:
  - Bisphosphonates/denosumab for bone disease.
  - Pain management per WHO ladder.
  - Adequate hydration to prevent renal progression.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Stem Cell Transplant**: If patient is fit; stem cells can be autologous or from donors.
