## Lung Cancer Overview

- **Types**: 
  - Small-Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC) - 15% of lung cancers, aggressive, associated with smoking.
  - Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).

### **SCLC Characteristics**
- **Aggressiveness**: Rapid growth, early extrathoracic metastases, paraneoplastic syndromes.
- **Diagnosis Timing**: Most patients present at advanced stages, making surgery often unfeasible.

### **Diagnosis**
- **Demographics**: Common in patients over 40, primarily smokers.
- **Incidence**: ~47,000 new cases annually in the UK.
- **Respiratory Symptoms**: Consider SCLC for smokers with new respiratory symptoms lasting >6 weeks.

#### **Common Symptoms**
- **Intrathoracic Symptoms**:
  - Cough
  - Dysphagia
  - Haemoptysis
  - Dyspnoea
  - Weight loss
  - [[Chest pain]]
  - Fatigue
  - Night sweats
  - Fever
  - Hoarseness
  - Finger clubbing

- **Extrathoracic Symptoms (30% at diagnosis)**:
  - Fatigue
  - Weight loss
  - Bone tenderness
  - Confusion
  - Hepatomegaly
  - Lymphadenopathy (supraclavicular or axillary)
  - Headache
  - Nausea/vomiting

- **Paraneoplastic Syndromes**: Affect ~10% of patients, causing extrapulmonary organ dysfunction.

### **Investigations**
- **Blood Tests**: Elevated LDH, hyponatremia, liver function tests.
- **Imaging**: 
  - Chest X-ray
  - Contrast-enhanced CT
  - PET-CT
- **Biopsies**: 
  - Bronchoscopy
  - Neck ultrasound
  - EBUS-TBNA
  - Surgical biopsy (if less invasive fails).

- **Distant Metastasis Evaluation**: Contrast-enhanced CT/MRI of brain, bone scans, liver ultrasound/biopsy when intensive treatment is planned.

### **Staging**
- **Two-Stage System**:
  - Limited Stage: Cancer confined to one hemithorax and regional lymph nodes.
  - Extensive Stage: Widely metastatic disease.

- **TNM Staging**: Rarely applied for SCLC; based on:
  - T: Primary tumor size/extent
  - N: Regional lymph node spread
  - M: Distant metastases.

### **Management (Prescribing)**
- **Limited-Stage Treatment**: 
  - Cisplatin-based chemotherapy (4-6 cycles).
  - Concurrent thoracic and prophylactic cranial irradiation.
  
- **Extensive-Stage Treatment**: 
  - Platinum-based chemotherapy (max 6 cycles).
  - Consider thoracic irradiation after chemotherapy.

- **Relapse**: Second-line chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, or topotecan.

- **Pain Management**: Strong opiates (e.g., morphine) prescribed as needed.

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- **Smoking Cessation**: Essential for all patients.
- **Surgery**: Rarely an option, only in very early stages.
- **Supportive Care**: 
  - External beam radiotherapy for bronchial obstruction.
  - Palliative measures based on disease stage and metastases location (e.g., pleural drainage, radiotherapy for specific symptoms, stents for vena cava obstruction).
