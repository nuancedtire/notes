Prostate Cancer  
- Malignant neoplasia of the prostate gland  
- Most common in men >50 years  
- 2nd leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the US  
- Early management can be curative; early stages present with genitourinary complaints  

### Diagnosis  
- Classical benign symptoms:  
  - Nocturia  
  - Hesitancy  
  - Increased frequency of urination  
- Advanced symptoms:  
  - Haematuria  
  - Dysuria  
  - Weight loss  
  - Bone pain  
  - Lethargy  

#### Risk Factors  
- Family history  
- Previous benign prostatic enlargement  
- High-fat diet  

#### Examination  
- Digital rectal examination can reveal:  
  - Irregular, enlarged prostate (malignant)  
  - Smooth enlargement (benign)  

### Investigations  
- PSA levels:  
  - Sensitive but not specific  
  - Elevated in various conditions (exercise, benign enlargement, prostatitis)  
- If PSA elevated:  
  - Multiparametric MRI for diagnosis and extent  
  - Transrectal ultrasound/MRI guided biopsy for histology  
  - Gleason score for prognostic groups  
- Bone imaging (x-ray or isotopic bone scan) for metastases in patients with bone pain  

### Management (prescribing)  
- Depends on prognostic scores: TNM staging, Gleason scoring, PSA levels  
- Management strategies:  
  - **Active Surveillance**  
    - 6-monthly PSA, annual biopsies, and PR examinations  
  - **Androgen-Deprivation Therapy**  
    - Surgical (bilateral orchidectomies)  
    - Chemical (LHRH antagonist/agonist, anti-androgen therapy)  
  - **Radiotherapy**  
  - **Surgical Resection of Prostate**  

### Management (non-prescribing)  
- Surgery: effective for localized prostate cancer  
  - Radical prostatectomy: removal of entire prostate  
  - Recommended for younger/healthier patients or older patients with >10 years life expectancy  
  - Side effects include erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence  

#### Patient Support  
- Address anxiety and worry about malignant disease  
- For active surveillance: Define symptom progression and establish safety netting
