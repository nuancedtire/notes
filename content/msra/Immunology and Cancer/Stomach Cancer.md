Stomach cancer (gastric cancer)  
- 3rd leading cause of cancer death globally  
- Common in Japan, China, parts of South America  
- Found anywhere in the stomach  
- Advanced stages at diagnosis, overall survival rate: **15%**  

### Diagnosis  
- Primarily affects men over age **55**  
- ~**6,600** new cases per year in the UK  
- Rarely causes early symptoms  

**Common Symptoms:**  
- Weight loss  
- Fatigue  
- Dysphagia  
- Poor appetite  
- Abdominal pain/discomfort  
- Anaemia  
- Heartburn/indigestion  
- Haematochezia  
- Nausea/vomiting  

- 70% present with uncomplicated dyspepsia in early stages  
- Antisecretory drugs (e.g., PPIs) may delay diagnosis

**Risk Factors:**  
- **Helicobacter pylori** infection (40% of cases)  
- Male gender  
- Advanced age  
- Poor socio-economic status  
- Familial risk  
- Smoking (20% of cases)  
- BMI > 30  
- Alcohol consumption (3+ units daily)  
- Work chemicals (e.g., rubber industry)  

### Investigations  
- **Full Blood Count (FBC)** – check for anaemia  
- **Endoscopic Gastroduodenoscopy (EGD)** – biopsies and evaluation (5+ biopsies)  
- **Staging Investigations:**  
  - CT Scan (thorax/abdomen)  
  - Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)  
  - Chest X-ray (CXR)  
  - MRI  
  - Bronchoscopy  
  - Laparoscopy  
  - HER2 status testing  

**Staging System – AJCC TNM**  
- T: Tumour size/extent  
- N: Regional lymph node involvement  
- M: Distant metastasis  

**TNM Classification:**  
- T0: No primary tumour  
- Tis: Carcinoma in situ  
- T1: Invasion of lamina propria/submucosa  
- T2: Invasion of muscularis/subserosa  
- T3: Penetration of visceral peritoneum  
- T4: Invasion of adjacent structures  
- N0: No lymph node spread  
- N1: 1-6 nodes  
- N2: 7-15 nodes  
- N3: >15 nodes  
- M0: No distant metastasis  
- M1: Distant metastasis  

**Overall Staging:**  
- Stage 0: TisN0M0  
- Stage IA: T1N0M0  
- Stage IB: T1N1M0 or T2N0M0  
- Stage IIA: T1N2M0 or T2N1M0 or T3N0M0  
- Stage IIB: T1N3M0 or T2N2M0 or T3N1M0 or T4N0M0  
- Stage IIIA: T2N3M0 or T3N2M0 or T4N1M0 or T4N2M0 or T4N0M0  
- Stage IIIB: T1N3M0 or T2N3M0 or T3N3M0 or T4N3M0 or T4N1M0 or T4N2M0  
- Stage IIIC: T3N3M0 or T4N3M0  
- Stage IV: Any T, any N, M1  

### Management (Prescribing)  
- **Surgery**: Primary cure; choice of treatment  
- **Chemotherapy**: Perioperative combination (standard care for localized cancer)  
  - **5-Fluorouracil (5-FU)**: most effective  
  - Other combos: cisplatin, epirubicin  
- **HER2-positive cancers**: Treat with Trastuzumab + chemotherapy  
- **Palliative Care**:  
  - Chemotherapy  
  - Corticosteroids  
  - Pain/nausea management  
  - Depression and constipation care  
  - Mouth care  

### Management (Non-Prescribing)  
- **Surgical Treatment**:  
  - Distal tumours: subtotal gastrectomy  
  - Proximal tumours: total gastrectomy  
  - D2 lymphadenectomy for curable cancer (min. 16 lymph nodes)  
  - Limited gastric resection for palliation  
- Investigate and support nutritional deficiencies  
- Palliative measures: endoscopy laser therapy, blood transfusions, coeliac plexus nerve blocks
