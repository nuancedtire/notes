## Acute Laryngitis Overview

- **Definition**: Inflammation of the larynx lasting < 7 days.
- **Etiology**: Primarily infectious (acute), with non-infectious causes leading to chronic laryngitis (> 3 weeks).

### Infectious Causes

- **Viral**: Rhinovirus (most common)
- **Bacterial**: 
  - Haemophilus influenzae
  - Beta-haemolytic streptococci
  - Historically Corynebacterium diphtheriae (decreased due to vaccination)
- **Fungal**: 
  - Candida
  - Cryptococcus (suspected in immunocompromised)

### Diagnosis

- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Based on history and examination; ranges from uncomplicated to severe with airway compromise.

#### Risk Factors

- Preceding upper respiratory tract infection
- Incomplete vaccination history
- Contact with infected individuals
- Travel to diphtheria endemic areas
- Immunocompromised state

#### Symptoms

- Hoarseness
- Aphonia (loss of voice)
- Sore throat
- Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
- Odynophagia (painful swallowing)
- Cough (may worsen with post-nasal drip)
- Fever
- Coryza
- Malaise (especially in diphtheria)
- Dyspnoea (if laryngeal oedema present)

#### Examination Findings

- Hyperaemic oropharynx
- Enlarged tonsils
- Cervical lymphadenopathy (indicates bacterial cause)
- Oropharyngeal white exudates (if diphtheria)
- Stridor (indicates airway compromise)
- Respiratory distress

### Investigations

- Generally not required for viral laryngitis.
- For suspected bacterial infection:
  - Swabs of oropharynx and nose for culture
  - Rapid antigen detection for Group A streptococcal infection
  - Diphtheria toxin detection (serum immunoprecipitation, PCR, or immunochromatography)

- **Laryngoscopy**: May be performed in secondary care to visualise the larynx.

### Management

#### Prescribing

- **Antibiotics**: Empirical treatment for suspected bacterial laryngitis based on local guidelines.
- **Diphtheria Antitoxin**: Administered to suspected diphtheria patients.
- **Corticosteroids**: Reserved for non-diphtheria patients with airway compromise.
- **Symptomatic Relief**: Analgesics, mucolytics, cough suppressants.

#### Non-Prescribing

- **Airway Assessment**: Essential; admit patients with evidence of airway compromise (e.g., inability to speak, stridor).
- **Diphtheria Patients**: Must be admitted and isolated.
- **Community Management**: 
  - Viral laryngitis: self-resolving; advise vocal rest and hydration.
  - Bacterial laryngitis: Managed with antibiotics as needed.
  - Chronic, diphtherial, or fungal laryngitis: Referral to secondary care indicated.
