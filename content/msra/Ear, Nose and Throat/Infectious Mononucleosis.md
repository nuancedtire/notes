Infectious mononucleosis, also known as glandular fever or kissing disease, is caused by Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV, Herpesvirus type 4). It features a triad of:
- Fever
- Lymphadenopathy
- Pharyngitis

**Non-EBV Causes**
When caused by organisms other than EBV, it's referred to as “mononucleosis” syndrome. Other infectious agents include:
- Herpes virus 6
- CMV
- HSV-1

**Transmission**
Viral particles are transmitted via:
- Bodily fluid secretions (kissing, blood transfusion, sexual intercourse).

### Diagnosis

- **Epidemiology**: Annual incidence is 50-100 cases per 100,000, peak age 15-19 years.
- **Incubation Period**: 30-50 days.
- **Classical Symptoms**: Fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis.
- **Other Symptoms**: Fatigue, splenomegaly, myalgia, bleeding, rashes.
- **Asymptomatic Cases**: Common in children.

**Physical Signs Include**:
- Hepatosplenomegaly
- Jaundice
- Maculopapular rash
- Palatal petechiae
- Bruising
- Periorbital edema

**Severe Cases**: Upper airway obstruction due to enlarged tonsils and lymph nodes.

**Complications**:
- Malignancies (e.g., nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma)
- Splenic rupture
- Interstitial nephritis
- Encephalitis

### Investigations

- **Blood Tests**:
  - **Monospot Test**: Determines presence of heterophile antibodies; false negatives may occur with CMV, lymphoma, rubella, HIV, or autoimmune disorders.
  - **EBV-Specific Antibodies Test**: High sensitivity/specificity to assess acute vs. past infection.
  - **Full Blood Count**: Increased WBC, possible anemia, thrombocytopenia in some cases.

- **Imaging**: Consider abdominal ultrasound or CT if splenic rupture is suspected.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **General Treatment**: Usually supportive (bed rest, analgesics, antipyretics, hydration) as most cases are self-limiting. No specific antivirals recommended; hospitalization typically unnecessary.
  
- **Upper Airway Obstruction**: Corticosteroids may help alongside airway protection (tracheostomy/intubation).

- **Thrombocytopenia**:
  - **With Active Bleeding**: IV immunoglobulin therapy.
  - **Without Bleeding**: Corticosteroids for thrombocytopenia if indicated.

- **Activity Restrictions**: Advise against contact sports or strenuous exercise for up to 8 weeks to avoid splenic rupture.
