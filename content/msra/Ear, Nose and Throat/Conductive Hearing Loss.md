## Hearing Loss Overview

Hearing loss is classified into two categories:
1. **Sensorineural Hearing Loss**
2. **Conductive Hearing Loss**
   - Caused by pathology of the outer or middle ear.

### Common Causes of Conductive Hearing Loss:
- **Cerumen Impaction**: Build-up of wax in the outer ear.
- **Otitis Media**: Infection of the middle ear; may cause tympanic membrane perforation. Most common in children.
- **Otosclerosis**: Abnormal bone growth at the stapes, fixing it in the oval window.

### Diagnosis:
- Patients with conductive hearing loss may report improved hearing in noisy environments.
- Symptoms include:
  - Tinnitus
  - Vertigo
  - Otalgia
  - Quiet speech (loud self-voice due to better bone conduction).
  - Children may appear unwell (fever, lethargy, irritability).

#### Clinical Tests:
1. **Whisper Test**:
   - Test one ear at a time by whispering a number/phrase.
   - Severity is assessed based on distance heard from good vs. affected ear.
   
2. **Rinne Test**:
   - Test bone conduction by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the mastoid process. 
   - Move it in front of the auditory canal to test air conduction.
   - Results:
     - **Normal/Sensorineural**: Air conduction > bone conduction.
     - **Conductive**: Bone conduction > air conduction.

3. **Weber Test**:
   - Place tuning fork on the forehead. 
   - Results:
     - Louder in affected ear: conductive hearing loss.
     - Louder in unaffected ear: sensorineural hearing loss.
     - No difference: normal or bilateral sensorineural hearing loss.

### Investigations:
- **Otoscopy**: Visual examination of the external ear and tympanic membrane.
  - **Findings**:
    - **Cerumen Impaction**: Visible wax.
    - **Otitis Media**: Red, bulging tympanic membrane; possible perforation or effusion.
    - **Otosclerosis**: Usually normal tympanic membrane; Schwartze sign may be present.

- **Audiometry**: Subjective or objective tests to differentiate hearing loss types.

### Management (Non-Prescribing):
- **Cerumen Impaction**: Soften with olive oil drops, then irrigate. Advise against cotton buds.
- **Otitis Media**: 
  - Most resolve in 1-4 days.
  - Use analgesia; antibiotics (e.g., amoxicillin) if bilateral or perforated.
  - Consider grommets for bilateral otitis media with effusion or severe hearing loss; refer to ENT.
- **Otosclerosis**: Refer to ENT for surgical options (stapedotomy or stapedectomy).

- **Hearing Aids**: Amplification for hearing; important for children to avoid speech developmental delays.
