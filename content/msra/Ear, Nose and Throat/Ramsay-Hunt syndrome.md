### Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome Overview
- Also known as: Herpes zoster oticus
- Cause: Reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the 7th cranial nerve ganglion
- Dormancy: Virus remains dormant but can reactivate 
- Common in: Elderly patients

### Differential Diagnosis
- **Bell's Palsy**: Sudden onset facial paralysis
- **Acoustic Neuroma**: Symptoms include tinnitus, hearing loss, and facial nerve weakness

### Triggers for Reactivation
- Stress
- Immunosuppression (e.g., AIDS)
- Malnutrition
- Elderly age

### Diagnosis
**Patient Symptoms:**
- Auricular pain
- Unilateral cranial nerve 7 palsy
- Vertigo
- Tinnitus
- Vesicular rash around the ear and mouth
- Sensorineural deafness (transient or permanent)

**Rash Characteristics:**
- Painful, erythematous, vesicular 
- Can spread to mouth, soft palate, or external ear canal
- Symptoms may not develop simultaneously

### Investigations
- **PCR Testing**: To show varicella-zoster virus in vesicular fluid
- **Recurrent Infections Investigation**: Identify other triggers related to risk factors

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Oral Antivirals**: Acyclovir or famciclovir
- **Corticosteroids**: Initiate within 3 days for improved outcomes
- Permanent hearing loss or paralysis can occur
- Facial nerve palsy recovery is less favorable compared to Bell's palsy

**Additional Medications:**
- Carbamazepine (for facial neuralgic pain)
- Antihistamines or anticholinergics (for vertigo)
