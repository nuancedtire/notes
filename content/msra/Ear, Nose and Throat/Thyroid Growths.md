### Thyroid Cancers

**Types of Thyroid Cancers**

1. **Differentiated Thyroid Cancers (90%)**
   - **Papillary Thyroid Cancer (80-85%)**
     - More common in women and younger individuals.
     - Usually slow-growing; may spread to lymph nodes in the neck.
     - Good overall cure rate.
   - **Follicular Thyroid Cancer (5-10%)**
     - More common in middle-aged individuals.
     - More likely to metastasize to distant sites; still good cure rate.

2. **Undifferentiated Thyroid Cancers (Rarer Types)**
   - **Medullary Thyroid Cancer (3-10%)**
     - Can be sporadic or hereditary (endocrine syndrome).
     - Arises from parafollicular cells, produces calcitonin (may cause diarrhea).
     - Poorer outlook compared to differentiated cancers.
   - **Anaplastic Thyroid Cancer (1-3%)**
     - Rapid growth; causes local invasion symptoms.
     - Poor outlook.
   - **Hürthle Cell Thyroid Cancer (4%)**
     - Abnormal Hürthle cells develop; sometimes grouped with follicular cancers.

### Thyroglossal Cysts

- **Definition**: Embryological remnant of the thyroid gland from incomplete thyroglossal duct closure; presents primarily in children/young adults.
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Typically located midline in the neck.
  - Elevates on swallowing or tongue protrusion.
- **Complications**:
  - Infection (treatable with antibiotics).
  - Cutaneous fistulas.
- **Management**: Surgical excision recommended for most cases.
