## Temporal Arteritis (Giant Cell Arteritis)

### Characteristics
- Serious headaches due to temporal artery vasculitis
- Primarily affects those over 55 years old
- Incidence: 5-18 in 100,000 (increases with age, more common in females)
- Immune-mediated arteritis involving extra cranial large arteries, particularly superficial temporal artery
- Ig from B cells attacks vessel proteins, leading to inflammation and vessel stenosis
- Formation of multifocal lesions with giant cells, accompanied by skip lesions
- Untreated cases can lead to permanent blindness due to ophthalmic artery inflammation and occlusion

### Diagnosis
**Common Symptoms:**
- Headache (non-specific, localized around the temporal artery)
- Systemic vasculitis symptoms:
  - Myalgia
  - Weight loss
  - Malaise
  - Fever
  - Night sweats
  - Arthralgia
  
**Associated Symptoms:**
- Tenderness and reduced/absent pulsation of the temporal artery
- Scalp tenderness and erythema
- Rapid onset (less than a month)
- Jaw claudication
- Possible ischaemic tongue

**Polymyalgia Rheumatica:**
- Associated condition with stiffness and pain in:
  - Neck
  - Shoulders
  - Upper arms
  - Hips

### Investigations
**First-line Investigations:**
- Full blood count
- Liver function tests
- CRP
- ESR
- Temporal artery ultrasound
- Temporal artery biopsy

- Elevated CRP and ESR indicate vasculitis (normal results suggest alternative diagnosis)
- Biopsy provides definitive diagnosis but negative results do not exclude temporal arteritis (segmental nature may miss affected area)

### Emergency Symptoms and Management
- **Transient Amaurosis Fugax:** Transient monocular visual loss due to anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy
  - Requires rapid treatment to prevent irreversible blindness
  - Any headache with visual problems in elderly women is suspected temporal arteritis until proven otherwise

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Immediate Treatment:** High-dose corticosteroids, gradually titrated down while monitoring CRP
  - Rapid steroid response is typical; lack of response necessitates reevaluation of diagnosis
- Long-term steroid treatment for several years is needed to confirm disease resolution
- Long-term steroid use may have significant side effects
- Urgent ophthalmology review is essential for significant visual symptoms
