Graves' disease is the most common form of hyperthyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions, classified as an autoimmune thyroid disease due to excessive thyroid hormone (T4 and T3) production from TSH receptor antibodies.

### Diagnosis
- **Prevalence**: Estimated at 0.2% to 1.3% in the UK, more common in females aged 30-50.
- **Association**: Linked to autoimmune conditions like Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Sjogren’s syndrome.

**Common Symptoms**:
- Tremor
- Irritability
- Sweating
- Heat intolerance
- Unplanned weight loss
- Diffuse goitre
- Palpitations
- Lethargy
- Menstrual disturbances (oligomenorrhoea)

**Physical Signs**:
- Heat intolerance
- Tremor
- Tachycardia/Arrhythmia
- Onycholysis 
- Acropachy 
- Goitre 
- Muscle weakness (typically proximal)
- Thyroid bruit 
- Pretibial myxoedema 

**Complications**:
- **Graves' Ophthalmopathy**: About 25% of patients may have dry eyes, photophobia, ophthalmoplegia, exophthalmos, diplopia, or blindness.
- **Thyroid Storm**: Life-threatening condition characterized by severe hyperthyroidism symptoms.
- **Osteoporosis**

### Investigations
- **Initial Tests**: Serum TSH, free T3, free T4 (primary hyperthyroidism: elevated T3/T4 & low TSH).
- **Graves' Disease Confirmation**: High serum TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) test; normal TRAb may lead to radioactive iodine uptake (I-123) testing.
- **Anti-TPO Antibodies**: Present in ~75% of patients.
- **Thyroid Ultrasound**: Only if nodular goitre or malignancy suspected.

### Management (Prescribing)
#### Symptomatic Management
- **First-line**: Beta-blockers (if contraindicated: calcium channel blockers like diltiazem or verapamil).
- **Tapering**: Gradually reduce medication once the patient is asymptomatic and euthyroid.

#### Antithyroid Medication
- **Guidance**: Requires specialist advice per NICE CKS.
- **Medications**: Carbimazole (first-line for non-pregnant patients), Propylthiouracil (for pregnant patients or those trying to conceive).
- **Duration**: 6 to 8 weeks to observe effects.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
#### Surgical Management
- **Thyroidectomy**: Total or near-total is preferred; pre-operative antithyroid medications aim to achieve euthyroidism.
- **Post-operative Care**: Initiate levothyroxine therapy; monitor T4 and TSH levels.
- **Surgical Risks**: Infection, bleeding, hypocalcaemia, vocal cord paralysis.

#### Radioactive Iodine Treatment
- **Indication**: First-line if medications or surgery fail.
- **Action**: Destroys thyroid tissue; may exacerbate Graves' ophthalmopathy—corticosteroids may be prescribed concurrently for up to 3 months.
- **Post-treatment**: Levothyroxine usually required afterward.
