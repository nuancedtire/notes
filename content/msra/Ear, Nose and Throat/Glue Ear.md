Glue ear (Otitis Media with effusion - OME) is a condition where the middle ear fills with fluid without acute inflammation, leading to temporary hearing loss. More common in children due to narrower Eustachian tubes, it can still affect adults and is the leading cause of hearing impairment in children.

### Diagnosis

#### Symptoms
- **Hearing Loss:** 
  - Dulled hearing (varying severity)
  - May worsen with thicker fluid or colds 
  - Risk of permanent damage if lasting over a few months
- **Accompanying Symptoms:**
  - Mild earache or tinnitus
  - Fluid increases risk of ear infection (more severe pain)
- **Adult Symptoms:**
  - Feeling of pressure
  - Tiredness
- **Observational Signs:**
  - Loud talking or difficulty hearing in children
  - Children may complain of ringing
  - Ear-pulling often indicates earache
- **Early Language Delay:** Chronic glue ear in young children increases the risk.

### Investigations
- **Otoscope Examination:**
  - Normal tympanic membrane appearance with OME 
  - Look for abnormal color, light reflex, opacification, air bubbles, retraction
- **Imaging:** 
  - Consider tympanometry (84-93% sensitive, 70-79% specific) and audiometry if not improving over 3 months.
- **Audiometry Types:**
  - Visual response for children 8 months-2.5 years
  - Conventional for children over 4 years
- **Regular Assessment:** Children with cleft palate or Down syndrome should be evaluated every 3-6 months for OME.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Medications:** No effective drugs for glue ear. Analgesia for ear pain; antibiotics if infection develops.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Observation:** Most cases resolve in 3 months. Wait 6-12 weeks while monitoring.
- **Autoinflation:** 
  - Balloon method for kids >3 years, helps fluid drainage.
  - Use Valsalva manoeuvre in older children.
  - Not advised if upper respiratory infection or pain occurs.
- **Hearing Aids:** For persistent bilateral OME with hearing loss if surgery isn't an option.

### Surgery
- **Myringotomy with Grommets:** 
  - For persistent bilateral OME with hearing loss >25-30 dBHL.
  - Consider adenoidectomy if appropriate.
  - Surgery may be prioritized for learning difficulties over hearing severity.
  - Grommets preferred over tympanostomy tubes due to complications.
- **Post-Surgery Care:** 
  - Protect ears when swimming/showering. 
  - Grommets typically fall out in 3-12 months; rechecking hearing is necessary.

### Speech Therapy
- Recommended for young children with chronic glue ear at risk for delayed speech/language.
