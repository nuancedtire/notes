### Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) Overview

- **Definition**: Disorder characterized by apnoea (>10 seconds without breathing) or hypopnoea (reduced breathing) due to upper airway collapse during sleep.
- **Episodes**: Can last 20 seconds to 3 minutes; occur 100-160 times per night.

### Symptoms

- Snoring, snorting, choking, night awakenings
- Non-restorative sleep, morning headache, daytime somnolence
- Mood changes: anxiety, irritability, depression
- Sexual dysfunction
- Long-term risks: hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), arrhythmias
- Cognitive effects: memory loss, decreased concentration, confusion

### Risk Factors

- Obesity (BMI >28 kg/mÂ²)
- Advanced age
- Male gender
- Craniofacial and upper airway abnormalities
- Mechanical obstruction (e.g., URTIs, allergies, enlarged tonsils/adenoids, nasal tumours)
- Family history of snoring or OSA
- Smoking

### Associated Medical Conditions

- Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
- Pregnancy
- End-stage kidney disease
- Congestive heart failure
- Chronic lung disease
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Stroke
- Acromegaly
- Hypothyroidism
- Polycystic ovary syndrome
- Floppy eyelid syndrome

### Diagnosis

- Based on clinical symptoms and respiratory events measured by nocturnal polysomnography.
- **Criteria**:
  - Asymptomatic: AHI of 15 or more
  - With symptoms: AHI of 5 or more
- Differential diagnoses: Insufficient sleep, sleep disorders, neurologic disorders, psychiatric disorders, medications.
- **Screening**: STOP-Bang questionnaire recommends considering its use preoperatively.
  - **STOP-Bang items**:
    - **S**noring
    - **T**iredness
    - **O**bserved apneas
    - Blood **P**ressure
    - **B**MI
    - **A**ge
    - **N**eck circumference
    - **G**ender
  - Score of 3 or higher indicates OSA.

### Investigations

- **Nocturnal Polysomnography (PSG)**:
  - Observes various parameters (brain waves, muscle activity, oxygen levels).
  - Can be done at home or in a lab; lab test more sensitive for complex cases.
  - **Repeat PSG** if initial result is negative and suspicion remains.
- Other diagnostics: TSH levels, blood pressure measurement, fasting blood sugar.

### Management

#### Non-prescribing

- Long-term, multidisciplinary care is essential.
- **Conservative Treatments**:
  - Patient education (motor vehicle accident risks)
  - Weight loss
  - Avoid supine sleeping, alcohol, sedatives, smoking
  - Treat nasal issues
  - **CPAP**: Primary treatment (95% effectiveness)
  - **BiPAP**: For severe OSA
  - **Dental appliances**: Alternative to CPAP
- **Surgical Options**:
  - Somnoplasty
  - Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP)
  - Tonsillectomy
  - Adenoidectomy (especially in children)

#### Prescribing

- Consider adjunctive pharmacological therapy for residual excessive sleepiness (controversial use).
