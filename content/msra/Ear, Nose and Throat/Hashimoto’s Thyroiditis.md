Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) is an autoimmune thyroid disorder characterized by the destruction of thyroid cells, leading to hypothyroidism. The primary antibody involved is anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO), followed by antithyroglobulin and TSH receptor-blocking antibodies. It is the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions.

### Diagnosis

- **Incidence**: 0.3 to 1.5 cases per 1000 persons annually.
- **Demographics**: Primarily affects middle-aged females (30-50 years), more common due to higher rates of autoimmune disorders in females.
- **Associated Conditions**: Other autoimmune conditions may include Sjogren’s syndrome, pernicious anemia, and celiac disease.

**Symptoms of Hypothyroidism**:
- Lethargy
- Cold intolerance
- Unintentional weight gain
- Bradycardia
- Constipation
- Dry skin
- Menstrual irregularities (menorrhagia)
- Decreased sweat production
- Diffuse goitre (enlargement of thyroid glands)

**Severe Hypothyroidism**: Myxoedema coma, a life-threatening emergency.

**Physical Findings**:
- Bradycardia
- Diastolic hypertension
- Hyporeflexia
- Macroglossia
- Non-pitting peripheral edema
- Hair loss (lateral third of the eyebrow)
- Cold dry skin
- Periorbital edema

**Hyperthyroidism Phase**: May occur initially, with symptoms including:
- Tachycardia/arrhythmia
- Restlessness
- Unintentional weight loss
- Palpitations
- Excessive sweating
- Heat intolerance
- Tremors
- Menstrual disturbances (typically oligomenorrhea)

### Investigations

- Total free T4 hormone
- Total free T3 hormone
- Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
- Thyroid autoantibodies (anti-TPO, anti-thyroglobulin)

**Typical Results**: Primary hypothyroidism profile with low T4 and T3, high TSH, and positive anti-TPO (anti-thyroid peroxidase). Note: Up to 15% may be antibody-negative.

**Further Evaluation**: Thyroid ultrasound may be necessary if malignancy or thyroid nodules need to be excluded, along with fine-needle aspiration and histological sampling.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Goal**: Achieve biochemically euthyroid state.
- **Treatment**: Long-term or lifelong levothyroxine administration (levothyroxine sodium).
  
**Side Effects of Levothyroxine** (usually from excessive hormone):
- Arrhythmia/tachycardia
- Diarrhea
- Flushing
- Headache
- Weight loss
- Menstrual disturbances (oligomenorrhea)
- Palpitations
- Tremors
- Vomiting

**Precaution**: Avoid taking levothyroxine with iron tablets to prevent reduced absorption.
