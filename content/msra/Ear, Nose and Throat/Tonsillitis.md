Tonsillitis Overview
=====================

- **Definition**: Acute inflammation of the palatine tonsils.
- **Common Age Group**: Children and young adults.
- **Causes**: 
  - Initially often viral.
  - Bacterial superinfection (50% of cases; Strep. Pyogenes is most common).

Complications
-------------
- Without proper management, can lead to:
  - Peritonsillar abscess
  - Pharyngeal abscess
  - Pneumonia
  - Glomerulonephritis
  - Rheumatic fever

Diagnosis
---------
**Common Symptoms**:
- Odynophagia
- Dysphagia
- Earache and headache (referred pain)
- Malaise
- Fever
- Nausea, vomiting, or febrile convulsions in some children.

**Signs**:
- Enlarged, hyperaemic tonsils (with/without exudate)
- Pyrexia
- Foetor (bad breath)
- Erythematous pharynx
- Enlarged cervical lymph nodes

Investigations
--------------
- Distinguish from glandular fever using:
  - FBC (Full Blood Count)
  - Blood film
  - Monospot test
- Acute tonsillitis shows raised white cell count and CRP.

Management
----------
### Prescribing
**Centor Criteria**: Use for antibiotic prescription (3 positive = 50% chance of Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus):
- Tonsillar exudate
- Fever
- Absence of cough
- Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy

**Other Indicators for Antibiotics**:
- History of rheumatic fever
- Marked systemic upset
- Immunosuppression

**Treatment**:
- 7-10 day course of:
  - Erythromycin (if penicillin-allergic)
  - Phenoxymethylpenicillin (to prevent rash in glandular fever)
- Paracetamol for analgesia.
- Encourage hydration.

### Non-Prescribing
**Hospital Admission Criteria**:
- Severe dehydration
- Systemically unwell
- Concerns about abscess
- Airway concerns

**Tonsillectomy Criteria**:
- Recurrent disabling infections:
  - At least 7 times in 1 year.
  - At least 5 times in 2 years.
  - At least 3 times in 3 years.
  - Disabling episodes affecting normal function.
  - Recurrent febrile convulsions due to tonsillitis.
  - Obstructive sleep apnoea, stridor, or dysphagia due to enlarged tonsils.
  - Peritonsillar abscess unresponsive to therapy.

**Post-operative Care**:
- Provide adequate analgesia and hydration.
- Monitor for bleeding (immediate or secondary to infection).
