## Meniere’s Disease Overview

- **Definition**: Disorder of the inner ear with excess endolymph in the membranous labyrinth.
- **Cause**: Not well understood; potential immune-mediated aetiology.

### Diagnosis

- **Age Group**: Typically affects adults aged 40-60.
- **Classical Triad**:
  - Tinnitus
  - Sensorineural hearing loss
  - Unprovoked vertigo
- **Other Symptoms**: Vomiting, nausea, aural fullness, rare drop attacks.
- **Attack Pattern**: Recurrent acute attacks lasting hours, often affecting one ear initially but may progress to the other.
- **Physical Exam Findings**:
  - Nystagmus towards the affected side.
  - Sensorineural hearing loss on the affected side.
  - Positive Unterberger test.
  - Negative Dix-Hallpike test.
  - Difficulty walking straight.

### Diagnosis Guidelines

1. **Gibson Point System**:
   - Maximum score: 10 points.
   - Categories: Vertigo, Hearing, Aural Fullness, Tinnitus.
   - Diagnosis if score ≥ 7.

| Category      | Description                                                  | Points |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Hearing       | Sensorineural difficulties                                   | 1      |
|               | Associated with aural fullness, vertigo, or tinnitus       | 1      |
|               | Fluctuating difficulties                                     | 1      |
| Aural Fullness| Lasts >10 minutes                                           | 1      |
|               | Associated with sensorineural difficulties                   | 1      |
| Tinnitus      | Lasts >10 minutes                                           | 1      |
|               | Associated with sensorineural difficulties                   | 1      |
| Vertigo       | Rotational, lasts >10 minutes                               | 1      |
|               | Associated with sensorineural difficulties                   | 1      |

### Investigations

- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Based on history and examination.
- **Recommended Investigations**:
  - Pure Tone Audiometry: Shows sensorineural hearing loss pattern.
  - MRI with Gadolinium Contrast: Rules out vestibular schwannoma and other lesions.
  - Electrocochleography: Assesses basilar membrane pressure; sensitive for active Meniere's disease.

### Management (Pharmacological)

- **Diuretics**: Hydrochlorothiazide or acetazolamide to reduce attack incidence (not routinely recommended in primary care).
- **Symptomatic Relief**:
  - Antiemetics: Prochlorperazine, promethazine.
  - Antihistamines: Cyclizine, meclizine, diphenhydramine, betahistine.
  - Benzodiazepines: Diazepam.

### Management (Non-Pharmacological)

- **Lifestyle Changes**: 
  - Reduced salt, caffeine, alcohol intake.
  - Smoking cessation and stress management.

- **Non-Pharmacological Options**:
  - **Meniett Device**: Micropressure delivery to ear canal.
  - **Endolymphatic Sac Decompression Surgery**: Relieves endolymphatic pressure.
  - **Intratympanic Corticosteroid Injection**: Addresses acute symptoms.
  - **Intratympanic Gentamicin Injection**: Reduces vertigo but may cause hearing loss.
  - **Vestibular Nerve Section**: Reduces vertigo while conserving hearing.
  - **Labyrinthectomy**: Inner ear removal; does not preserve auditory/vestibular function.

- **Rehabilitation**: Vestibular and balance rehabilitation post-surgery.
- **Supportive Aids**: Masking for tinnitus, hearing aids for hearing loss.
- **Efficacy**: Up to 80% symptom control with non-invasive management.
