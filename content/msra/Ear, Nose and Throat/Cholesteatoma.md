- **Distinguishing Conductive vs Sensorineural Hearing Loss:**

  - **Rinne Test:**
    - **Positive Result** (Air Conduction better than Bone Conduction):
      - Indicates either normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss.
    - **Negative Result** (Bone Conduction better than Air Conduction):
      - Indicates conductive hearing loss.

  - **Weber Test:**
    - **Localized Centrally**:
      - Indicates either normal hearing or hearing loss that is equal bilaterally (correlate with Rinne test findings and patient symptoms).
    - **Localized to One Side**:
      - Indicates either conductive hearing loss on that side or sensorineural hearing loss on the opposite side.
