- **Definition**: Trigeminal neuralgia characterized by severe facial pain in the trigeminal nerve distribution area.
- **Prevalence**: Affects 3 in 100,000 people, with onset typically in individuals over 60.

- **Causes**:
  - Often idiopathic.
  - Secondary in younger patients (e.g., multiple sclerosis, cerebellopontine angle tumors).
  - Compression of the trigeminal nerve by the superior cerebellar artery leading to irritation/demyelination.
  
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Hypertension.
  - More common in men.

### **Diagnosis**
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Unilateral shooting pain in the face (usually over the second and third trigeminal branches).
  - Rarely affects the eyes.
  - Bilateral pain suggests demyelinating pathology.
  - Paroxysmal pain with remissions.
  - Pain often triggered by sensory stimuli (e.g., shaving, teeth brushing).

- **Physical Examination**:
  - No other physical signs typically present.
  - Muscle wasting, sensory loss, or impaired reflexes may indicate secondary causes.

### **Investigations**
- Diagnosis criteria include:
  - More than 3 attacks confined to the trigeminal area.
  - Severe, shock-like pain in short episodes (seconds).
  - Triggered episodes.

- **Further Investigations** (especially in younger patients or with bilateral pain):
  - **MRI**: Look for white matter plaques in multiple sclerosis.
  - **Visual evoked potentials**: Assess axonal conduction velocity in multiple sclerosis.

### **Management (prescribing)**
- **First-line treatment**: 
  - Carbamazepine
- **Other options**:
  - Gabapentin
  - Lamotrigine

### **Management (non-prescribing)**
- Referral to neurology for:
  - Lack of response to first-line therapy.
  - Patients under 50 years.
  
- Invasive options if medical management fails:
  - Ablation of trigeminal ganglion.
  - Botulinum toxin injection for refractory cases.
