### Bell's Palsy Overview
- **Definition**: Acute, unilateral facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) palsy.
- **Onset**: Symptoms develop within 72 hours.
- **Etiology**: Unknown, often associated with viral infections.

### Diagnosis
- **Strongest Risk Factor**: Pregnancy (especially in the third trimester and up to one week post-partum).
- **Weaker Risk Factors**: Upper respiratory infections, diabetes, family history.

#### Clinical Features
- Rapid onset, unilateral symptoms:
  - Loss of nasolabial fold
  - Drooping of mouth corner and drooling
  - Unable to raise eyebrows or form forehead wrinkles (forehead affected in lower motor neuron lesions).
  - Inability to fully close eyelid (risk of keratoconjunctivitis sicca).
  - Inability to puff cheeks or smile (affected side droops).
  - Loss of taste anterior 2/3 of tongue.
  - Hyperacusis (sound sensitivity).
  - Ear or post-auricular pain.
  - Facial synkinesis may occur 3-6 months post-episode; if present acutely, consider alternative diagnoses (e.g., malignancy).

#### Grading
- **House-Brackmann Scale (HBS)**: Ranges from 1 (normal) to 6 (no movement).

### Investigations
- **Diagnosis**: Primarily clinical; imaging/tests only to rule out alternatives (CT/MRI for malignancy or serology for Lyme disease).
- **Severe Cases (HBS 5 or 6)**:
  - **Serial Electronegography (ENoG)**: At least 72 hours post-onset for nerve degeneration assessment.
  - **Needle EMG**: Confirms absence of voluntary motor unit potentials.

### Management

#### Prescribing
- Recovery seen in 70% of patients within 6 months.
- **Prednisolone**: Administer within 72 hours to improve recovery time and outcomes.
- **Antivirals (e.g., Valaciclovir)**: Recommended for severe paralysis.

#### Non-Prescribing
- **Eye Protection**: Essential for dry eye management.
  - Suggest glasses and artificial tears during the day.
  - Use lubricants and consider eyelid taping overnight.
  - Refer to ophthalmology if vision is affected or keratopathy is suspected.

#### Surgical Decompression Criteria
- Clinically undetectable unilateral facial movement.
- Onset of facial palsy within 14 days.
- ENoG shows >90% reduction in CMAP amplitude.
- Needle EMG indicates absence of voluntary motor unit potentials.
