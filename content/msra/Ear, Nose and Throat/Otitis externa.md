### Otitis Externa Overview

**Definition:**
- Inflammation of the skin of the external auditory meatus.

**Causes:**
- Multifactorial, including:
  - Trauma from ear digging/scratching
  - Swimming/water exposure
  - Occlusive ear devices (hearing aids, earphones)
  - Allergic contact dermatitis (shampoos, cosmetics)
  - Overuse of topical antibiotics/steroids
  - Eczema/psoriasis (predisposing factors)

**Common Microorganisms:**
- Pseudomonas Aeruginosa
- Staphylococcus Aureus
- Aspergillus niger
- Candida albicans (otomycosis/fungal)

### Symptoms
- Otalgia (ear pain)
- Pruritus (itching)
- Otorrhoea (discharge; green suggests P. Aeruginosa, creamy suggests fungal)
- Hearing loss

### Signs
- Tenderness of tragus/auricle upon movement
- Erythema and swelling of the external auditory canal
- Possible debris/discharge obscuring the tympanic membrane
- Cracked or crusted skin
- Intact tympanic membrane; may show signs of granulation tissue

### Severity
- **Mild:** Minor discomfort, some canal edema
- **Moderate:** Intermediate pain, partially occluded canal
- **Severe:** Complete obstruction, intense pain, periauricular erythema, adenopathy, fever

### Complications
- Perichondritis
- Facial cellulitis

## Diagnosis
- Clinical examination and history-based.
- Differential diagnosis includes:
  - Otomycosis
  - Contact dermatitis
  - Chronic suppurative otitis media
  - Ear canal carcinoma

### Malignant Otitis Externa
- Severe case spreading to skull base; risk factors include older age, diabetes, immunocompromised states.
- Symptoms: severe pain, otorrhoea, granulation tissue, cranial nerve palsies.

## Investigations
- Generally no investigations required.
- Ear swab may be needed for severe cases or non-responsiveness to treatment.

## Management (Prescribing)
- **Mild:** 
  - Non-antibiotic topical with acidifying agent (e.g., Acetic acid-hydrocortisone).
- **Moderate:**
  - Acidic topical with antibiotic, antiseptic, glucocorticoid (e.g., Sofradex).
  - If fungal, Canesten (clotrimazole) ear drops for 10 days.
- **Severe:**
  - Similar to moderate but may require wick for medication accessibility. 
  - Systemic treatments if deeper tissue involved.
  - Oral Ciprofloxacin for swelling/cellulitis.
  - Analgesics (NSAIDs, opioids).

## Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Aural toilet (microsuction or dry mopping) to remove debris.
- Patient education: 
  - Avoid water exposure during bathing; use earplugs.
  - Avoid digging in ears.
- Post-inflammation, inspect tympanic membrane for underlying issues.
- Refer malignant cases to otolaryngologist.
