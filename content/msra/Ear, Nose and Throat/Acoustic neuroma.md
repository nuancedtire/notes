## Acoustic Neuroma (Vestibular Schwannoma)

- **Definition**: Benign intracranial tumour from Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve (eighth cranial nerve).
- **Function of Schwann Cells**: Produce myelin sheath for peripheral nerves, improving conduction speed.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Benign but can cause hearing/balance issues.
  - Small chance of malignant transformation.
  - Usually unilateral and sporadic; bilateral associated with neurofibromatosis type 2 (hereditary condition).

## Diagnosis

- **Common Symptoms**:
  - Unilateral hearing loss.
  - Progression to tinnitus, vertigo, unsteadiness, facial numbness, and facial weakness.
  - Headaches less common, seen in advanced cases with larger tumours.
  - Symptoms of raised intracranial pressure may occur in advanced disease.

- **Imaging**:
  - **Cranial Imaging**: Recommended for suspicious symptoms.
  - **Gold-Standard**: Gadolinium-enhanced MRI for definitive diagnosis; detects small tumours.
  - **Preliminary Imaging**: Often CT and plain MRI prior to Gad imaging due to better availability.

## Investigations

- **Audiograms**: Identify type of hearing loss.
  - Typical finding: high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss with reduced speech discrimination.
  
- **Auditory Brainstem Response Tests**: Screen for disruption in vestibulocochlear nerve impulses, may indicate acoustic neuroma.
  
- **Imaging Sequence**:
  - Start with CT or MRI.
  - Gadolinium-enhanced MRI if lesions are detected.

## Management

### Prescribing

- No specific medications.
- Options:
  - Observation.
  - Surgery.
  - Radiotherapy.

### Non-Prescribing

- **Conservative Management**: 'Watchful waiting', regular monitoring with MRI.
  - Ideal for elderly or patients with comorbidities.
  - Supportive measures (e.g., hearing aids, occupational therapy for assistance).

- **Surgery**:
  - Curative but full resection often not possible.
  - Aim: tumor control and hearing preservation.
  - Traditional Approaches: retrosigmoid, middle fossa, or translabyrinthine craniotomy.
  - **Complications**: Damage to cranial nerves (facial paralysis, hearing loss) and CSF leaks.
  - Regular MRI monitoring for regrowth.

- **Radiotherapy**:
  - Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for targeted treatment.
  - Administered as a single fraction; does not cure but can arrest tumor growth or shrink size.
  - Requires ongoing MRI scans for monitoring.
