## Impacted Ear Wax (Cerumen Impaction)

- **Definition**: Accumulation of excessive ear wax (cerumen) in the external auditory canal, leading to conductive hearing difficulties. Cerumen protects and lubricates the ear canal.

### Diagnosis

- **Common in**: Elderly patients (due to ear hair, drier wax, cognitive impairment, hearing aids).
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Ear fullness
  - Hearing loss
  - Vertigo
  - Tinnitus
  - Repeated external ear infections

### Investigations

- **Methods**:
  - Otoscopy (visualization of the ear canal)
  - Audiogram (to rule out other pathologies)

### Management

#### Prescribing

- **First-line**: Cerumenolytic ear drops to soften ear wax for natural removal.
- **Recommended**: Olive oil or almond oil. 
- **Contraindications**: Prior tympanostomy.

#### Non-prescribing

- **Removal Methods**:
  1. **Ear Irrigation**: Low-pressure water stream (by primary care practitioners).
  2. **Manual Removal**: Performed by ENT specialists using microscopy.

- **Cerumen Solvents** (to aid in softening):
  - Hydrogen peroxide
  - Liquid docusate sodium
  - Olive oil
  - Carbamide peroxide
  - Glycerine
  - Acetic acid
  - Mineral oil
  - Triethanolamine
  
*Note*: Repeated use of cerumen solvents can irritate the external ear.

- **Caution**: 
  - Ear irrigation not recommended for patients with:
    - Ear-canal stenosis
    - History of ear surgery
    - Tympanic membrane perforation
    - Recurrent external otitis
  - Referral to ENT specialist is recommended for these patients.
