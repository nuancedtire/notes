- **Peripheral Hearing System Components:**
  - **Outer Ear:**
    - Pinna
    - Ear canal
    - Tympanic membrane
  - **Middle Ear:**
    - Air-filled space
    - Contains ossicles: malleus, incus, stapes
    - Malleus connects to tympanic membrane; stapes connects to inner ear
  - **Inner Ear:**
    - Cochlea (for hearing and balance)
    - Contains sensory cells
    - Connected to central hearing system via auditory nerve

- **Sound Wave Transmission:**
  - Sound waves travel as air vibrations.
  - Pinna collects and funnels vibrations into ear canal.
  - Vibrations cause tympanic membrane movement.
  - Ossicles transfer sound vibrations to cochlea.
  - Stimulated hair cells in cochlea determine pitch and frequency.
  - Nerve impulses generated travel along auditory nerve to brainstem.
  - Impulses reach auditory cortex for sound comprehension.

- **Types of Hearing Problems:**
  - **Conductive Hearing Loss:**
    - Issues in outer/middle ear.
    - Sound is not transferred efficiently to cochlea (cochlea functions normally).
    - Typically affects sound volume (e.g., difficulty hearing low volume).
    - Examples: wax blockage, perforated eardrum.
  
  - **Sensorineural Hearing Loss:**
    - Issues between cochlea and brain.
    - Sound is not processed normally.
    - Possible hair cell damage, auditory nerve damage, or auditory pathway defects.
    - Common causes: aging, excessive noise exposure.
  
  - **Mixed Hearing Loss:**
    - Combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.
