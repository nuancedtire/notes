Bacterial tonsillitis is inflammation of the tonsils caused by bacteria, commonly affecting children and young adults in winter. The primary bacterial cause is group A streptococci (GAS), with rarer causes including Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Recurrent or chronic tonsillitis may stem from polymicrobial infections.

### Diagnosis

**Clinical Features:**
- Sore throat
- Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
- Fever
- Red and swollen pharynx
- Tonsillar exudates
- Tender and swollen cervical lymph nodes
  
**Additional Features in Children:**
- Headache
- Nausea and vomiting
- Abdominal pain

**Modified Centor Score:**
Assess the likelihood of GAS tonsillitis and guide further actions.

| Criteria                                      | Points |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------|
| Absence of cough                              | +1     |
| Tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes   | +1     |
| Temp > 38°C                                  | +1     |
| Exudate on tonsils                           | +1     |
| Age – 3-14 yrs                               | +1     |
| Age – 15-44 yrs                              | 0      |
| Age - ≥45 yrs                                | -1     |

**Score Interpretation:**
- **≤ 1**: No testing/antibiotic treatment – likely viral.
- **2-3**: Rapid antigen testing and/or throat culture for GAS.
- **≥ 4**: Rapid antigen testing/throat culture and empirical antibiotics may be appropriate.

### Investigations

**Testing to Rule Out GAS:**
Based on the modified Centor score, investigations include:
- **Rapid antigen testing**: First-line.
- **Throat swabs for culture**: If rapid test negative, to detect GAS or other infections.
- **Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)**: Alternative, but not commonly used.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Antibiotics**: Required for confirmed GAS tonsillitis to prevent acute rheumatic fever. First-line is a 10-day course of oral penicillin V. Alternatives (macrolides, cephalosporins, clindamycin) for penicillin-allergic patients.
- **Analgesia**: Paracetamol or ibuprofen for pain relief in all pharyngitis cases.
