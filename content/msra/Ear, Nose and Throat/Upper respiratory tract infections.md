- **Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URTI)**: 
  - Common; typically 1 per year.
  - More prevalent in elderly and infants.
  - Common causes: H. influenza, rhinovirus, RSV (in children).

- **Course of Infection**: 
  - Usually self-limiting within 10 days.
  - Rare complications: 
    - S. Pyogenes can lead to rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis.
    - Influenza can worsen in those with pre-existing lung disease or co-morbidities.

## **Diagnosis**
Symptoms indicative of a URTI:
  - Rhinorrhoea
  - Sneezing
  - Otalgia
  - Enlarged tonsils (with or without exudate)
  - Cervical lymphadenopathy
  - Sore throat
  - Cough (purulent phlegm indicates bacterial infection)
  - Fever
  - Malaise
  - Odynophagia

### Acute URTIs:
- Diphtheria or acute epiglottitis may present with:
  - Dyspnoea
  - Drooling
  - Stridor

## **Investigations**
- History and examination usually sufficient for diagnosis.
- **Additional tests**:
  - Nasal/throat swabs for confirmation.
  - Monospot test, blood film, and RBC if glandular fever suspected.
  - Chest x-ray if pneumonia suspected.

## **Management (Prescribing)**
- Follow **Centor criteria** for antibiotic prescribing:
  - If 3 out of following are present, 50% chance of Group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus:
    - Tonsillar exudate
    - Fever
    - Absence of cough
    - Tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy

### Other indicators for antibiotics:
- History of rheumatic fever
- Marked systemic upset
- Immunosuppression
- Acute epiglottitis
- Bronchitis with chronic lung disease
- Children with bilateral otitis media
- Diphtheria

### Treatment:
- 7-10 days course of:
  - **Erythromycin** (if penicillin-allergic)
  - **Phenoxymethylpenicillin** (instead of amoxicillin to prevent rash in glandular fever)
- Paracetamol for analgesia 
- Encourage plenty of oral fluids.
