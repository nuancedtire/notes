## Primary Cancers of the Head and Neck

- **Common Type:** Squamous cell carcinoma
- **Common Sites:** Oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, salivary glands
- **Most Common Lesions:** Lateral border of the tongue, floor of the mouth

### Symptoms
- Painful ulcerating mass on the tongue
- Sore throat
- Referred otalgia
- Bleeding
- Difficulty swallowing
- Lump in the neck (metastases to level 2 cervical lymph nodes)

### Risk Factors
- Tobacco smoking
- Alcohol consumption
- Betel nut chewing
- Chronic irritation/inflammation (sharp teeth, dentures)
- Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection
- Premalignant lesions:
  - Oral leukoplakia (white patches)
  - Erythroplakia

### Second Primary Malignancy Risk
- Increased risk for cancers of the head, neck, lung, and esophagus, primarily related to alcohol and tobacco exposure.

## Diagnosis

- **Method:** Biopsy of lesion
- **Differentials for Mouth Swelling:**
  - **Congenital:** Hemangioma, cystic hygroma
  - **Acquired:** Ranula, mucous retention cyst, torus palatinus (osteoma of the hard palate)
  - **Neoplastic:**
    - **Benign:** Salivary tumors (e.g., pleomorphic adenoma)
    - **Malignant:** Squamous cell carcinoma, salivary tumors (e.g., adenoid cystic carcinoma), sarcoma, lymphoma
  - **Dental:** Abscess, cyst

## Investigations

- **Biopsy:** Under general anesthesia for depth assessment
- **Pan-endoscopy**: Evaluate upper aerodigestive tract for second primary malignancies
- **Imaging Options:** PET, CT, MRI for staging:
  - **Primary Tumor:** Deep perioral biopsy
  - **Regional Lymph Nodes/Distant Metastases:** CT, MRI, or PET

## Management 

### Non-prescribing Options
1. External beam/interstitial radiotherapy
2. Surgical en-bloc resection with reconstruction (myocutaneous free flaps from radial forearm or fibula)
3. Chemoradiotherapy
4. Minimally invasive transoral laser resection for large tumors

- **Early-stage Treatment:** Primary surgery preferred; radiation has higher morbidity
- **Larger Tumors:** Consider ipsilateral neck dissection or adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy
- **Locally Advanced Cancer:** Multimodal treatment; initial surgery and neck dissection followed by adjuvant radiation or chemoradiotherapy
- **Non-surgical Options:** Definitive radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy if surgery not available.
