## Oesophageal Cancer Overview

- **Ranking**: 8th most common cancer, 6th most common cause of death worldwide.
- **Types**: 
  - **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)** - more common.
  - **Adenocarcinoma (AC)** - rising incidence.

## Differences Between SCC and AC

| **Characteristic** | **SCC** | **AC** |
|---|---|---|
| **Risk Factors** | - Smoking <br> - Alcohol <br> - HPV infection <br> - Poor nutritional status | - Barrett’s oesophagus <br> - GERD <br> - Smoking <br> - High BMI |
| **Pathobiology** | - Located at mid-oesophagus | - Located near oesophagogastric junction <br> - Evidence of Barrett’s oesophagus <br> - Involvement of celiac and perihepatic lymph nodes |

## Clinical Manifestations

- Early stage: May be asymptomatic or mild symptoms (reflux, indigestion).
- Late stage: 
  - Progressive dysphagia (solid > liquids).
  - Weight loss, regurgitation, anaemia.
  - Odynophagia (late sign).
- Local complications: Hoarseness, respiratory issues from aspiration pneumonia or tracheo-oesophageal fistula.
- Systemic signs: Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, metastases to bone, liver, lung, brain.

## Diagnosis

- **Biopsy**: Endoscopic biopsy confirms diagnosis.
- **Mucosal Mass**: Large mass seen endoscopically can indicate cancer.
- **Tumour Location**: Oesophagogastric junction cancers considered oesophageal if epicentre ≤ 2cm into stomach.
- **Staging**: TNM system for locoregional and distant metastases, with separate groupings for SCC and AC.

## Investigations

- **Diagnosis Confirmation**:
  - **OGD** (oesophagogastroduodenoscopy) with biopsy or brush cytology.
  - **Barium swallow** - non-invasive, but cannot confirm histology.
  
- **Staging**:
  - **Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS)** for locoregional staging.
    - T staging - depth of wall invasion.
    - N staging - malignant nodes.
  - **CT Scan** for distant metastases.
    - Nodes >10mm = metastatic.
  - **PET/CT** for ruling out distant metastases.

- **Complication Assessment**:
  - **FBC**: Check for bleeding (low Hb) or aspiration pneumonia (high WCC).
  - **U/E/Cr**: Electrolyte disturbances due to vomiting.
  - **Liver Function Test**: Low albumin indicates nutritional deprivation.
  - **Laryngoscopy**: Vocal cord paralysis assessment.

- **Pre-operative Workup**:
  - Group and save, cross-match, PT/PTT.
  - CXR, ECG, lung function test, 2D echogram.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Surgical Options**:
  - Suitable for localized and lower T-staged lesions.
  - Tri-incisional approach: right thoracotomy/thorascopic, laparotomy/laparoscopy, left neck incision.
  - Endoscopic mucosal resection for early cancers.
  - Non-operative management for high comorbidity burden patients.

- **Chemoradiotherapy**:
  - Effective but higher local recurrence rate compared to surgery, preferred for cervical cancers.
  - Recommended concurrent use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
  - Indications: neoadjuvant therapy, definitive therapy for non-surgical candidates, selective postoperative adjuvant therapy.
  - Optimal protocols not definitively established.
