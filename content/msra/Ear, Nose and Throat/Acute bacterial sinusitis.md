## Acute Bacterial Sinusitis (Rhinosinusitis)

### Definition
- Inflammation of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses lasting less than 4 weeks.
- Bacterial infections constitute 0.5–2% of acute sinusitis episodes, often secondary to viral infections.

### Common Bacterial Causes
- **Streptococcus pneumoniae**
- **Haemophilus influenzae**
- **Moraxella catarrhalis**

### Predisposing Factors (especially in children)
- Viral upper respiratory infection
- Allergic rhinitis
- Anatomic obstruction
- Mucosal irritants
- Sudden atmospheric pressure changes

### Complications
- Inflammation extension into CNS, orbit, or surrounding tissues:
  - Preseptal and orbital cellulitis
  - Orbital subperiosteal abscess
  - Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis
  - Meningitis
  - Osteomyelitis of frontal bone
  - Epidural, subdural, or brain abscess

### Diagnosis
- Clinical assessment based on symptoms:
  - Purulent nasal drainage, nasal obstruction
  - Facial pain/pressure/fullness
  - Maxillary tooth discomfort
  - Systemic signs: fever, fatigue
  - Cough, sore throat, hyposmia, anosmia
  - Ear pressure/fullness, headache, halitosis
- Symptom persistence >10 days without improvement suggests bacterial etiology.

### Differential Diagnosis
- Viral upper respiratory infection
- Allergic/non-allergic rhinitis
- Nasal foreign body
- Enlarged/infected adenoids
- Mucosal cyst of maxillary antrum
- Pertussis (catarrhal stage)

### Investigations
- No confirmatory tests needed unless complications are present.
- If indicated, urgent evaluations include:
  - Contrast-enhanced CT scan of orbits, sinuses, and brain
  - MRI as an alternative
- Imaging if structural abnormalities are suspected.

### Management (Prescribing)
- Self-limiting nature; 70-80% improve within two weeks.
- 10-day trial of symptomatic management is recommended.
- Antibiotics for persistent, worsening symptoms or young patients.
- Individualize treatment for immunocompromised or those with comorbidities.
- **First line:** Phenoxymethylpenicillin
- **Amoxicillin-clavulanate:** If systemically unwell or high complication risk.
- **Doxycycline:** Alternative for penicillin allergies.
- Duration: 5-7 days; most respond within 7 days.
- Confirm diagnosis through imaging if initial treatment fails.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Supportive treatment options:
  - Intranasal corticosteroids
  - Antipyretics
  - Nasal saline irrigation
  - Topical decongestants
  - Mucolytics
