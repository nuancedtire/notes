Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting women of any age, characterized by endometrial tissue and glands found outside the uterine cavity, notably in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and pelvic peritoneum.

## Diagnosis
- **Confirmatory Method**: Direct visualization and histology via laparoscopy.

### Diagnostic Factors
- Dysmenorrhea
- Chronic/cyclic pelvic pain
- Dyspareunia
- Sub-fertility
- Uterosacral ligament nodularity
- Fixed, retroverted uterus
- [[msra/Psychiatry/Depression|Depression]]

### Risk Factors
- Family history of endometriosis
- Nulliparity
- Lower body mass [[index]]
- Smoking
- Previous caesarean section
- Mullerian anomalies

## Investigations
- **First-order Investigation**: Transvaginal ultrasound
- **Other Investigations**:
  - Rectal endoscopic ultrasound
  - 3D ultrasonography
  - MRI pelvis
  - Hysterosalpingography
  - Diagnostic laparoscopy

## Management (Prescribing and Non-Prescribing)
The relationship between endometriosis severity and [[Infertility]] is not fully established, but increased adhesions are believed to decrease natural conception chances.

### For Patients Struggling to Conceive
- **First-line**: Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (e.g., clomifene)
- **Second-line**: In-vitro fertilization

### For Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis
- Surgical intervention is usually required, especially if symptomatic. 
- Therapeutic laparoscopy should be offered to symptomatic patients regardless of deep disease presence.

### Symptomatic Patients Not Planning to Conceive
- **With Endometrioma or Suspected Deep Disease**: Surgery followed by post-surgical hormone therapy.
- **Without Endometrioma or Suspected Deep Disease**: 
  - First-line: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
  - First-line: Combined [[Oral Contraceptive Pill]] (COCP)
  - Second-line: GnRH agonist
  - Second-line: GnRH antagonist
  - Third-line: Androgen
  - Fourth-line: Hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and excision of visible peritoneal disease, followed by hormone-replacement therapy.
