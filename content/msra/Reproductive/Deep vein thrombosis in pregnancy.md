[[Deep vein thrombosis]] (DVT) is a type of venous thrombus that commonly occurs during pregnancy and in other prothrombotic states. If a DVT breaks off and travels as an embolus, it can lead to venous thromboembolism (VTE), which may lodge in the lungs as a pulmonary embolus (PE). VTE, if untreated, results in high morbidity and mortality; PE is the leading direct cause of maternal death in the UK. The RCOG has developed national guidelines for thromboprophylaxis in at-risk pregnant women and the management of VTE.

### Diagnosis

Pregnancy is associated with increased thrombotic risk, but not all women require thromboprophylaxis. Women at higher risk of VTE during pregnancy and puerperium include:

**Pre-existing Risk Factors**
- Previous VTE
- Thrombophilia (incl. family history)
- Prolonged admission
- Age >35 years
- BMI ≥30
- Parity ≥3
- Smoker
- Gross [[Varicose veins]]

**Obstetric Risk Factors**
- Caesarean section
- Multiple pregnancy
- Prolonged labour (> 24 hours)
- Stillbirth
- Preterm birth
- Major postpartum hemorrhage (>1L/transfusion)
- Current [[Pre-Eclampsia]]

**Transient Risk Factors**
- Surgical procedure
- Bone fracture
- Hyperemesis, dehydration
- Admission or immobility (≥3 days)
- Current systemic infection
- Assisted reproductive technology used
- Long-distance travel (>4 hours)

### Clinical Features

**DVT** (1 in 1,000 pregnancies):
- Pyrexia and leg pain
- Swelling
- Erythema
- Oedema (especially in the left leg)

Diagnosis: Doppler ultrasound or MR venograms.

**PE** (1 in 2,000 pregnancies):
- Dyspnoea
- Collapse
- [[Chest pain]]
- Haemoptysis
- Raised JVP
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnoea

Symptoms may also relate to DVT. Diagnosis: CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPA) or ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scans.

**Cerebral Venous Thrombosis** (1 in 10,000 pregnancies) may present with headache/[[Stroke]] during the puerperium. Diagnosis: MRI.

### Investigations

#### Suspected DVT:
- **D-dimer**: Not helpful due to physiological changes in pregnancy.
- **Doppler ultrasound** or **venogram**.

#### Suspected PE:
- **Chest X-ray**, **[[ECG]]**, and **arterial blood gas**.
- **Portable echo** if unstable.
- **CTPA** or **V/Q scan**:
  - CTPA may increase lifetime [[Breast cancer]] risk and has higher nondiagnostic rates.
  - V/Q scanning may increase childhood cancer risk; preferred in young women with family history of [[Breast cancer]].
- Lab diagnosis for **antiphospholipid syndrome**: 
  - Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, and/or anti-β2-glycoprotein I (measured twice >3 months apart).

### Management

- **First Line**: Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH, e.g. enoxaparin, dalteparin) for antenatal/postnatal thromboprophylaxis. Duration varies based on specific risk factors. Routine anti-Xa level monitoring is needed only if there is antithrombin deficiency. 

- **Antiphospholipid Syndrome**: Treated with LMWH and aspirin during pregnancy; considered high-risk, receiving serial ultrasound scans and elective induction.

- If DVT is confirmed via ultrasonography, no further investigation is needed; continue VTE treatment.

- **Unstable Patients** with massive PEs: Require thrombolysis/i.v. heparin/thrombectomy. 
- **Stable Patients**: Should be anticoagulated with LMWH.
