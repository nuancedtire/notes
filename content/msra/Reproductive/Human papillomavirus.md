- **HPV Subtypes**:
  - Over 100 subtypes classified into:
    - Mucosal or anogenital
    - Non-genital (cutaneous)
    - Epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EV)
  
- **Virus Characteristics**:
  - Family: Papilloviridae
  - Type: Non-enveloped
  - DNA: Circular, double stranded
  - Infection Pathway: Enters epithelium through disrupted skin/mucosa, infects basal stem cells

- **Risk Factors**:
  - History of sexual activity with multiple partners (risk even with first encounter)
  - Sharing sex toys

- **Risk Level of Subtypes**:
  - Low Risk: Subtypes 6 and 11 (low-grade precancerous lesions)
  - High Risk: Subtypes 16 and 18 (high-grade lesions can progress to malignancies)

- **Cancer Development**:
  - Requires triggers: smoking, immunosuppression, folate deficiency, UV light exposure, pregnancy

## Diagnosis
- **Physical Examination**:
  - Cutaneous warts: Examine hands and feet (between digits)
  - Anogenital warts: Inspect anogenital area; may require speculum exam of anus/vagina; consider oropharyngeal exam
  - Cervical dysplasia: Speculum exam of cervix

- **Cervical Screening**:
  - Offered to women aged 25-64, includes HPV testing
  - Abnormal Pap smear = referral for colposcopy

## Investigations
- Screening tests available for pre-cancer/cancer changes in asymptomatic women
- Treatment of precancerous changes can prevent cancer
- Early stage cancer detection improves curative treatment chances

## Management (Prescribing)
- Immunocompromised patients (e.g., HIV) should receive appropriate antiretroviral medication and adherence education

## Management (Non-Prescribing)
- HPV vaccination for ages 12-13: Targets subtypes 6, 11, 16, 18
- **Patient Education**:
  - Promote safe sex practices (e.g., condom use)
  - Encourage Pap smear screenings
  - Advise against multiple sexual partners

- Patients with dysplasia from Pap tests: refer for colposcopy
- High-grade dysplasia treatments: cryotherapy, LEEP, cold knife cone excision
- HPV-associated carcinoma management may include excision, chemotherapy, and/or radiotherapy
