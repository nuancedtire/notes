### Recurrent Candidiasis

- **Definition**: Four or more episodes in one year, with partial symptom resolution between episodes.
- **Indications**: Poor response to antifungal treatment may suggest an underlying disease, particularly immunocompromised states.
- **Screening Considerations**:
  - **Underlying Diseases**: Important to check for predisposing factors (e.g., antibiotic use, risky sexual behaviors, estrogen exposure).
  - **Diabetes**: Poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus correlated with recurrent [[Candidiasis]]; blood glucose measurement is a simple, initial screening test.
  - **HIV**: Consider HIV testing despite not fitting high-risk group demographics, as anyone can be infected.

### Genitourinary Disease

- **Presentation**: Symptoms may vary, including:
  - Local genital symptoms
  - Urinary and abdominal symptoms
  - Systemic upset
- **Affected Populations**: Both genders experience similar symptoms (skin changes, genital pain/swelling, dysuria, discharge), though presentation can differ anatomically.
- **Common Conditions**: Often sexually transmitted (e.g., gonorrhea, [[Chlamydia]]), may be asymptomatic, making diagnosis challenging; many cases identified via screening and contact tracing.
- **Prevalence**: Genitourinary diseases are common, especially in sexually active individuals, and often present in primary care or emergency settings.
- **Impact**: Conditions can significantly affect quality of life, leading to complications like [[Infertility]], sexual dysfunction, and social stigma; thus, early identification and treatment are crucial.
