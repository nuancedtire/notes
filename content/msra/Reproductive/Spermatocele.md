**Spermatoceles**
- **Definition**: Painless fluid-filled masses (spermatic cysts).
- **Location**: Near the top or behind the testicle, separate from it.
- **Contents**: Commonly hold sperm; smooth with cloudy fluid.

**Causes**
- Unknown; possibly due to:
  - Epididymal duct blockage and proximal dilation.
  - Inflammatory processes or idiopathic origins.
- **Risk Factors**: Previous vasectomy; more common in middle-aged men.

**Diagnosis**
- **Symptoms**: Heaviness or constant dull pain; some remain asymptomatic.
- **Examination**: Fluid-filled mass in the superior aspect of the testicle.
- **Transillumination**: Requires a pen torch; cyst illuminates, unlike solid masses.

**Investigations**
- **Ultrasound**: Common method; reveals 1-2cm hypoechoic lesion.

**Management**
- **Prescribing**: 
  - Treat if painful or size is irritating; oral pain relief.
  
- **Non-prescribing**:
  - Observation for non-painful cases.
  - Minimally invasive therapies:
    - **Aspiration**: Fluid withdrawal.
    - **Sclerotherapy**: Injecting irritants to scar and close the cyst; limited use due to risks.
  - **Surgery (Spermatocelectomy)**: Removal of the spermatocele; done as an outpatient.
    - Not definitive; recurrence in 10-25% of cases.
    - Risk of epididymis damage and infertility; caution in young men.
