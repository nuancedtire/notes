## Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)

### Overview
- Characterized by cysts in ovaries but not necessary for diagnosis.
- Related to dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.
- Major cause of subfertility, affecting up to 10% of women of childbearing age.
- Some overlap with metabolic syndrome.

### Classical Findings
- **High LH**: Excessive androgen production, converted to estrogen, causing high androgen and estrogen levels.
- **High estrogen**: Leads to no LH surge or FSH secretion, resulting in anovulation, amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea.
- **Hyperinsulinaemia/insulin resistance**: Contributes to increased androgen levels and ovarian dysfunction.

### Long-term Risks
- Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM)
- Obesity
- Dyslipidaemia
- Hypertension
- Vascular disease
- Endometrial cancer

### Diagnosis
**Rotterdam criteria (two required):**
- Infrequent or absent periods
- Hyperandrogenism (acne/hirsutism/alopecia)
- Ultrasound showing at least 12 cysts on one ovary

**Additional Clinical Features:**
- Menstrual cycle disturbance and fertility problems (75%)
- Obesity (50%)
  - Acanthosis nigricans (due to insulin resistance)
- Mood swings
- Depression

### Investigations
- Blood tests: LH:FSH ratio >3:1 within the first 5 days of the menstrual cycle.
- Elevated estrogen, testosterone, and androstenedione levels.
- Ultrasound: small follicles at the ovary's periphery.
- Test for impaired glucose tolerance.

### Management (Prescribing)
- Focuses on patient's primary concern: fertility, hirsutism, or menstruation.
  
**For Fertility:**
- First-line: Metformin.
- Clomifene for ovulation induction (increases gonadotroph secretion, inhibits FSH but raises multiple births risk).
- Gonadotropins if other treatments fail.

**For Hirsutism/Contraception:**
- Combined Oral Contraceptive Pill (COCP) to modulate menstrual cycle.
- Cyproterone acetate as an anti-androgen (risk of venous thromboembolism).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Weight loss and dietary changes can normalize ovulation and other symptoms.
- Ovarian drilling (puncture of 10-12 follicles) may temporarily improve fertility.
