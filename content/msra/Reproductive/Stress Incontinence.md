- **Definition**: Stress urinary incontinence is involuntary urine loss due to effort, exertion, sneezing, or coughing, caused by increased intra-abdominal pressure.

- **Causes**:
  - Bladder neck defects leading to sphincter deficiency
  - Urethral hypermobility (often due to weak pelvic floor muscles, post-childbirth or post-[[msra/Reproductive/Menopause|Menopause]])
  - Neuromuscular defects affecting sphincter function
  - Prostatectomy in men
  - Pelvic weakness from surgery or pregnancy in women

- **Consequences**: Urine leaks occur when intra-abdominal pressure surpasses urethral resistance. Most prevalent in women and during pregnancy.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Pregnancy/childbirth
  - Age/[[msra/Reproductive/Menopause|Menopause]]
  - [[Obesity]]
  - [[Constipation]]
  - Pelvic organ prolapse
  - Chronic [[Cough]]/smoking
  - Excessive weight lifting

## Diagnosis
- Symptoms include predictable, small urine leaks without urge prior to leakage, often during exertion (exercise/coughing).
- Full neurological, vaginal, and rectal examinations should be conducted to identify causes (e.g., prolapse).

## Investigations
- **Initial Tests**:
  - Urine dipsticks and cultures to exclude infections
  - Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) for kidney function assessment
  - Pad test for quantifying leakage

- **Additional Tests**:
  - Urodynamic studies to measure bladder and urethral closure pressures
  - Urinary stress tests (e.g., Valsalva manoeuvre)
  - Cystoscopy to rule out fistulae or tumours

## Management (Prescribing)
- If lifestyle and pelvic floor exercises fail, consider:
  - Alpha-adrenergic agonists
  - Topical oestrogen for postmenopausal women
  - Tricyclic antidepressants

## Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **First-line strategies**:
  - Lifestyle modifications: weight loss, reduced caffeine, [[Smoking cessation]]
  - Behavior therapy: pelvic floor exercises and vaginal weights

- **Surgical Options**:
  - Mid-urethral sling to enhance urethral resistance or support bladder neck
  - Surgical fixation of displaced urethra and bladder neck to surrounding tissues

- **Supportive measures**:
  - Absorbent pads
  - Catheterization
  - Vaginal pessaries
