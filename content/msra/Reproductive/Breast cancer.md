## Breast Cancer Overview

### Breast Cancer Types

#### Non-invasive
- **Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS)**
  - Detected via mammogram as calcification.
  - High chance of becoming invasive.

- **Lobular Carcinoma in Situ (LCIS)**
  - Slow progression; may lead to cancer in either breast.
  - More common in premenopausal women.

#### Invasive
- **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma** (most common)
  - Hard lump, skin tethering, visible on mammogram.

- **Invasive Lobular Carcinoma**
  - May have minimal symptoms, often hard to detect on mammogram.

- **Other types** include:
  - Mucinous cancer
  - Medullary cancer
  - Papillary cancer
  - Tubular cancer

### Risk Factors
- Age
- Prior radiotherapy (especially <35 years)
- Age at first birth
- Genetics (e.g., BRCA, p53 abnormalities)
- Hormone Replacement Therapy (≥5 years post-50)
- Menopausal age (later increases risk)
- Age at menarche (younger increases risk)
- Family history
- Obesity
- Alcohol and smoking

### Recurrence Predictors
- Tumor size
- Histological subtype and grade
- Patient age (younger is worse)
- Menopausal status (premenopausal is worse)
- Receptor subtype
- Lymph node involvement

### Staging (TNM System)
- **Stage 0**: Non-invasive, e.g., DCIS.
- **Stage 1**: 
  - 1A: Tumor ≤2cm, no lymph node involvement (T1N0M0).
  - 1B: Small number of cancer cells in lymph nodes (T1N1miM0).
  
- **Stage 2**: 
  - 2A: 1-3 axillary lymph nodes involved (T0N1M0) or tumor ≤2cm with axillary lymph involvement (T1N1M0).
  - 2B: Tumor 2-5cm with small lymph node involvement or 1-3 involved nodes (T2N1M0).

- **Stage 3**: 
  - 3A: 4-9 axillary nodes involved or tumor >5cm with node involvement.
  - 3B: Tumor of any size spread to chest wall/skin and lymph nodes.

- **Stage 4**: Metastatic (M1), typically spreads to bones, liver, lung, brain.

### Diagnosis
- Detected mainly through screening; mammograms not typically done before age 40.
- Patient pathways:
  - Urgent referral to breast center if symptomatic.
  - Standard screening followed by triple assessment.

#### Symptoms
- Painless mass, possible discharge, tethering, ulceration.
- Signs of metastasis: jaundice, bone pain, lymphedema, shortness of breath.
- Constitutional symptoms: weight loss, night sweats, loss of appetite.

### Investigations
- **Triple assessment**: palpation, radiology (mammography/US), fine-needle aspiration.
- Blood tests: CA-15-3 may indicate presence of cancer.
- Imaging: mammography for those >40, ultrasound for younger patients, CT scans if spread is suspected.

### Biopsy Findings
- Grade, Ki-67 proliferation [[index]], receptor status (oestrogen, progesterone, HER2).

### Management

#### Prescribing
- **Neoadjuvant chemotherapy**: downsizes tumors for surgery.
  
- **Radiotherapy**:
  - Criteria: breast-conserving therapy, large tumors, lymph node metastases.

- **Chemotherapy**: 
  - Pre-menopausal: hormone modulators, risks include hot flushes, weight gain.
  - Post-menopausal: aromatase inhibitors, generally better tolerated.

- **Adjuvant therapy**: trastuzumab for HER2 positive tumors; avoid concurrent use with anthracyclines.

#### Non-prescribing Surgical Options
1. **Surgical Mastectomy**: 
   - Complete breast removal; options for reconstruction.

2. **Oncoplastic Breast Reduction**: 
   - Significant tissue removal with cosmetic reshaping.

3. **Wide Local Excision**: 
   - Removal of tumor + surrounding tissue.

4. **Lymph Node Excision**: 
   - For staging and treatment. 

5. **Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy**: 
   - Identifies primary lymph node for malignancy assessment if initial biopsy is negative.

### Post-Surgery
- Referral to oncologist post-surgery for further management.
