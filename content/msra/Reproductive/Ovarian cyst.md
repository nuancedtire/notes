## Ovarian Cysts Overview

- **Definition**: Benign fluid-filled sacs in the ovary, common in women of all ages.
- **Size**: Ranges from <1 cm to >10 cm.

### Symptoms
- **Asymptomatic**: Found incidentally on pelvic imaging.
- **Pain/Pressure**: In lower abdomen/pelvis.
- **Abdominal Distension**: Bloating.
- **Ascites**: Fluid accumulation.
- **Acute Abdomen**: Complications like rupture or torsion (may include nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding).
- **Irregular Menstrual Cycles**: Not typically related to ovarian cysts.

### Signs
- **Adnexal Mass**: Common finding.
- **[[Hirsutism]]**: Particularly in PCOS.

### Causes
#### Premenopausal
- **Functional/Follicular Cysts**: Result from ovulation; generally resolve spontaneously.
- **Corpus Luteal Cysts**: Develop after ovulation.
- **Theca Lutein Cysts**: Formed with high hCG levels; associated with multiple gestations.
- **Dermoid Cysts**: Common in ages 20-40; may contain hair/teeth.
- **PCOS**: Multiple persistent cysts; linked to chronic anovulation.
- **Endometriotic Cysts**: Associated with [[msra/Reproductive/Endometriosis|Endometriosis]]; "chocolate cyst."
- **Pregnancy**: Cysts can develop to support early pregnancy.
- **Severe Pelvic Infections**: Result in pus-filled cysts.
- **Non-cancerous Growths**: Generally benign.
- **Cancer**: Less common in this age group.

#### Postmenopausal
- **Non-cancerous Growths**: Generally benign.
- **Cancer**: Higher risk in older women, particularly with a family history.

## Diagnosis
1. **General Evaluation**: Confirm presence and location of mass; assess symptoms.
2. **Focused Evaluation**: Requires immediate treatment if presenting with acute symptoms.
3. **Evaluation for Malignancy**: If initial evaluation raises suspicions.
   - **History**: Evaluate risk factors (e.g., BRCA mutations, [[Infertility]]).
   - **Physical Examination**: Check for signs of malignancy.

### Different Diagnoses Based on Presentation
#### Gynaecological Causes
- **Benign**: Functional cysts, corpus luteal cysts, PCOS, endometriomas.
- **Malignant**: Ovarian carcinomas, germ cell tumours.

#### Non-gynaecological Causes
- **Benign**: [[Constipation]], pelvic abscess.
- **Malignant**: Appendiceal neoplasms, bowel neoplasms.

#### Acute Abdomen
- Ruptured ovarian cyst, adnexal torsion, [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Appendicitis|appendicitis]].

## Investigations
- **Pelvic Ultrasound**: First-line diagnostic tool.
- **MRI/CT Scan**: Additional imaging as needed.
- **Urine Pregnancy Test**: To rule out pregnancy.
- **Tumour Markers**: CA-125 for [[msra/Reproductive/Ovarian cancer|Ovarian cancer]], others for germ cell tumours.
- **Surgery**: For histological evaluation or treatment, especially in postmenopausal women.

## Management
### Prescribing
- **Analgesics**: For pain relief in low-risk cysts.
- **Oral Contraceptives**: Decrease lifetime risk of epithelial cancers and help cyst resolution.

### Non-Prescribing
- **Ruptured Cysts**: 
  - Uncomplicated: Monitor, consider surgery if needed.
  - Complicated: Observation for stable patients; surgery for unstable patients.
  
- **Asymptomatic Cysts**: 
  - Conservative monitoring; repeat ultrasounds for assessment.
  - Surgery if large, symptomatic, or concerning for malignancy.

- **Cysts During Pregnancy**: Most benign; functional cysts often resolve by the end of the first trimester. Surgical options if indicated.
