Menopause is a natural event in women, occurring between ages 45-55, with an average age of 51. It results in the permanent cessation of menstruation and ovulatory function due to the depletion of oocytes.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical diagnosis**: Made retrospectively after 12 months of [[Amenorrhoea]] in an appropriate age woman.
- **Symptoms**: Vary considerably; can appear before, during, or years after menopause:
  - Menstrual irregularity
  - Vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats)
  - Vaginal symptoms (dyspareunia, discomfort, dryness)
  - Mood changes (irritability, mood swings, recurrence of [[msra/Psychiatry/Depression|Depression]])
  - Sleep disturbances
  - Loss of libido
  - Other (brittle nails, thick skin, hair loss, mild memory impairment, aches)

### Investigations
- Not required for women over 45 with symptoms.
- Serum FSH recommended for women under 40 or aged 40-45; raised levels indicate menopause.
- Urine pregnancy test for sexually active women with [[Amenorrhoea]].

### Management (prescribing)
- **Indication**: Pharmacological treatment if symptoms affect quality of life.
- **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)**:
  - Reduces risk of [[Osteoporosis]] and cardiovascular disease but may increase:
    - Thrombosis risk (especially in first year)
    - [[Breast cancer]] risk (minimally, with combined therapy)
  
- **Contraindications for HRT**:
  - Oestrogen-dependent malignancies
  - Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding
  - Pregnancy
  - Active liver disease
  - Active thromboembolic disorder or recent myocardial infarction

- **Types of HRT**:
  - **Combination HRT**: Oestrogen + progesterone; for women with a uterus.
    - **Continuous**: Daily intake; for those >1 year post-menopause.
    - **Sequential**: Progesterone added cyclically; for perimenopausal women.
  
  - **Oestrogen-only HRT**: For women without a uterus; taken daily.

- **Administration methods**: Oral, transdermal patches, sprays, gels. Preferred transdermal for higher thrombotic risk.

- **Alternative treatments if HRT is not suitable**:
  - **Vasomotor symptoms**: 
    - First-line: SSRIs/SNRIs
    - Second-line: Gabapentin
    - Third-line: Clonidine
  - **Vaginal dryness**: Vaginal oestrogens and moisturisers
  - **Reduced libido**: Combination oestrogen-androgen

### Management (non-prescribing)
- Conservative approaches for mild symptoms include:
  - Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, and stress
  - Wearing layered clothing 
  - Using fans

- **Exercise and Weight Management**: Important for cardiovascular health.

- **Screening recommendations**:
  - [[Cervical screening]]: Every 3 years (25-49), every 5 years until 65
  - [[Breast cancer]] screening: Every 3 years after 50
