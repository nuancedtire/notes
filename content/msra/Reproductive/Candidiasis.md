Candidiasis Overview
- Naturally occurs in small numbers in:
  - Oropharyngeal cavity
  - Skin
  - GI tract
  - Genitourinary tracts
- **Candida albicans**: Most common cause of candidiasis, a dimorphic fungus.
- Local infections: Oral thrush, vaginal infections, infections in skin folds (e.g., axilla).
- Systemic infections can occur in immunocompromised patients.

### Risk Factors for Immunosuppression
- HIV
- Diabetes
- Neonates
- Neutropenia

### Local Flora Imbalances
- Contributing factors:
  - Increased estrogen (e.g., pregnancy)
  - Antibiotics/steroids
  - Moisture (e.g., nappy rash, burns)

### Infection Progression
- Local infections from flora imbalances cause candida overgrowth.
- Systemic infections start locally, spreading to:
  - Bloodstream (candidaemia)
  - Tissues
  - Vital organs

## Diagnosis
- **Skin Infections**: 
  - Erythematous satellite lesions
  - Nappy dermatitis in infants (peaks at 3 months)

- **Oral Thrush (Pseudomembranous Candidiasis)**: 
  - White plaques that can be scraped off, bleeding underneath
  - Symptoms: loss of taste, pain while eating, cotton sensation in mouth

- **Candida Oesophagitis**: 
  - Common in AIDs or hematological malignancies
  - Symptoms: odynophagia, oral thrush signs

- **Vulvovaginitis (Vaginal Yeast Infections)**: 
  - White, odourless, crumbly discharge
  - Vulva itching
  - History of recent antibiotics; vaginal pH of 4-4.5

- **Systemic Infection Symptoms**:
  - Fever
  - Skin rash
  - Headache
  - Neurological deficits
  - Organ infiltration signs (e.g., meningitis, endocarditis)

## Investigations
- Clinical suspicion is primary for diagnosis.
- Additional tests:
  - Potassium hydroxide smear: budding hyphae or yeasts
  - Blood/tissue culture: shows candida antigens
  - Endoscopy for suspected oesophageal infections

## Management (Prescribing)
- **Skin Infections**: 
  - Topical antifungals (7-14 days): clotrimazole, ketoconazole
- **Vaginal Infections**: 
  - Topical antifungals same as skin; single dose of oral fluconazole is an option.
  
- **Oral Candidiasis**: 
  - Topical nystatin or oral fluconazole as first-line
  - Second-line: itraconazole or voriconazole.
  
- **Oesophageal Candidiasis**: 
  - Oral or IV fluconazole for 14-21 days.

- **Systemic Infections**: 
  - IV capsofungin or micafungin for at least 2 weeks post-symptom resolution
  - Alternatively, fluconazole if not critically ill.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Vulvovaginitis**: 
  - Avoid local irritants (harsh soaps)
  - Moisturize with mild emollients for vulva care.
