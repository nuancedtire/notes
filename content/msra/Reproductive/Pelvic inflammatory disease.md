### Overview
- Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an acute infection affecting the upper female genital tract.
- Common initiating pathogens:
  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae
  - Chlamydia trachomatis
  - Mycoplasma genitalium
- Other potential organisms: Escherichia coli, anaerobes, and streptococci.

### Risk Factors
- **Sexual Behaviour**
  - Young age
  - Sexually active females
  - Unprotected intercourse
  - Multiple sexual partners
  - Recent new partner
  - Past history of STIs
- **Uterine Instrumentation**
  - Termination of pregnancy
  - Insertion of IUD

### Pathophysiology
- Infection typically ascends from the lower reproductive tract, leading to:
  - Cervicitis
  - Endometritis
  - Salpingitis
  - Oophoritis
  - Parametritis
  - Tubo-ovarian abscesses
  - Peritonitis
  - Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome (perihepatitis)

### Contraception
- Most methods do not significantly alter PID risk.
- Condoms consistently provide protection.

### Complications
- Chronic pelvic pain
- Ectopic pregnancy
- Subfertility
- Hydrosalpinx
- Recurrent PID
- Ovarian cancer

### Clinical Presentation
- Asymptomatic
- Symptomatic (acute):
  - Lower abdominal pain (acute)
  - New, purulent vaginal discharge
  - Abnormal menstrual bleeding
  - Dyspareunia
  - Fever and chills
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Tender pelvic organs (hallmark feature)
  - Right hypochondrial tenderness (suggestive of perihepatitis)

### Diagnosis
- High suspicion in young or sexually active females with pelvic discomfort.
- Key examination findings:
  - Cervical motion, uterine, or adnexal tenderness
- Additional findings suggesting PID:
  - Fever (>38.3Â°C)
  - Mucopurulent vaginal discharge
  - Cervical friability
  - Abundant white blood cells in vaginal secretions
  - Positive tests for N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, or M. genitalium.

### Investigations
- Perform tests for infections/comorbidities:
  - Urine pregnancy test
  - Full blood count, CRP, ESR
  - Endocervical and high vaginal swabs
  - Urine cultures
  - Microscopy of vaginal discharge
  - Nucleic acid amplification tests for STIs
  - Serologic testing for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B
  - Pelvic ultrasound to assess complications.

### Management (Prescribing)
- Initiate antimicrobial therapy upon presumptive diagnosis due to high morbidity.
- Coverage for gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens is essential.
- Empiric therapy for anaerobes/M. genitalium only in select cases (recent instrumentation/severe PID).
- **Hospitalized Patients:**
  - IV second-generation cephalosporin (e.g., Cefoxitin) + oral doxycycline.
  - Alternatives: IV clindamycin + gentamicin.
  - Transition to oral therapy after clinical improvement for >24 hours.
- **Outpatient Management:**
  - IM ceftriaxone + oral doxycycline (14 days).
  - Add metronidazole based on criteria previously mentioned.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Indications for Hospitalization:**
  - Severe illness (high fever, vomiting, severe pain).
  - Suspected pelvic abscess.
  - Pregnancy.
  - Inability to tolerate/response to oral therapy.
  - Diagnostic uncertainty.
- Potential surgical intervention for abscess drainage or other complications.

### Post-Recovery Care
- Ensure medication adherence and lifestyle modifications.
- Avoid sexual activity until treatment completion and symptom resolution.
- Contact tracing of male partners recommended.
- Barrier contraception is advised; avoid IUDs due to higher infection/ectopic risk.

### Follow-Up
- Review for clinical improvement within 72 hours; reconsider hospitalization or further investigations if necessary.
