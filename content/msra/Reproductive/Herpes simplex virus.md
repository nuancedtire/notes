Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Overview
==============================

**Classification & Structure**
- Member of the Alphaherpesviridae subfamily.
- Composed of linear double-stranded DNA.

**Infection Cycle**
1. Primary infection in epithelial cells.
2. Latency in neuronal ganglia.
3. Periodic reactivation (mostly asymptomatic).

**Transmission**
- Predominantly via body fluids (e.g., sexual intercourse).

**Types**
- HSV-1 and HSV-2 can both cause genital herpes.

**Clinical Manifestations**
- Ocular, oral, and genital ulcers.
- Recurrent infections can lead to neurological, hepatic, respiratory, or ocular complications.
- Women: fever, neuralgia, genital pain/discharge, dysuria, ulcers.
- Men: urethritis, vesicles on penis.

**Asymptomatic Shedding**
- Possible without lesions; can lead to transmission.

Diagnosis
========

**Factors**
- Risk factors include:
  - Immunosuppressive medication
  - High-risk sexual behavior (multiple partners, no condom use)
  - HIV positive
  - Female gender/non-Caucasian race
  - Increased age
- Presence of symptoms: genital ulcers/vesicles, dysuria (women), lymphadenopathy, oral ulcers, fever.

Investigations
==============

1. **Viral Culture**
   - Detects virus presence, typically when lesions are present.

2. **HSV Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)**
   - Measures virus copies/ml; more sensitive than viral culture.

3. **Glycoprotein G-based Type-Specific Serology**
   - Determines positivity for HSV-1 or HSV-2.

Management (Prescribing)
=========================

- **First-line Treatment**
  - Oral acyclovir, valaciclovir, or famciclovir.

- **Symptomatic Treatment**
  - Can be used as an adjunct.

- **Oral Infections**
  - Topical antivirals as second-line treatment.

- **Immunocompromised Patients**
  - Foscarnet as third-line for oral infections.
  - Foscarnet as second-line for genital infections.

Management (Non-Prescribing)
=============================

- **Education**
  - Important for high-risk individuals to reduce infection risk.
  - Essential for positive HSV patients to understand symptoms.
