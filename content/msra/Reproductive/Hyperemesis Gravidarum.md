Hyperemesis gravidarum is defined as severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. It occurs in 1% of pregnancies, potentially caused by elevated b-hCG levels, most commonly between 7-12 weeks, and may last up to 20 weeks.

### Diagnosis

Diagnosis criteria include persistent nausea and vomiting with the following triad:

- **Dehydration**: Dry mucous membranes, postural dizziness, tachycardia, hypotension  
- **Electrolyte imbalance**  
- **>5% weight loss** from pre-pregnancy weight  

Ketosis is often present.

**Risk Factors**:

- Positive family history  
- Previous nausea/vomiting in pregnancy  
- Increased placental mass:
  - Multiple gestations  
  - Gestational trophoblastic disease  
  - Trisomy 21 or 18  
- Female fetus  

### Investigations

For first-time severe nausea and vomiting, the following investigations are needed:

- **Blood Tests**:
  - FBC: normal
  - Urea and electrolytes: electrolyte imbalance
  - Liver function tests: normal  
  - Thyroid function tests: may indicate hypo/[[msra/Endocrinology and Metabolic/Hyperthyroidism|Hyperthyroidism]]  

- **Urine Tests**:
  - Urinalysis: ketonuria and elevated specific gravity (helps rule out UTI)  

- **Ultrasound Scan**: To confirm viable intrauterine pregnancy (associated with multiple pregnancy and trophoblastic disease)  

No need to repeat TFTs or ultrasound in subsequent episodes if initial tests were normal.

### Management (Prescribing)

**Inpatient Treatment Includes**:

- **Rehydration**: 
  - IV Fluids, first-line Hartmann’s solution; replace calculated deficit, ongoing losses, and maintenance  
- **Anti-emetics**:
  - First-line:
    - Cyclizine 50 mg PO, IM, or IV 8-hourly  
    - Prochlorperazine 5–10 mg PO 6–8 hourly; 12.5 mg IM/IV 8-hourly; 25 mg PR daily  
    - Promethazine 12.5–25 mg PO, IM, IV, or PR every 4–8 hours  
    - Chlorpromazine 10–25 mg PO, IV, or IM every 4–6 hours; 50–100 mg PR every 6–8 hours  
  - Second-line:
    - Metoclopramide 5–10 mg every 8 hours PO, IV, or IM (max 5 days)  
    - Domperidone 10 mg every 8 hours PO; 30–60 mg PR  
    - Ondansetron 4–8 mg every 6–8 hours PO; 8 mg IV over 15 minutes every 12 hours  
  - Third-line: 
    - Corticosteroids: Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV twice daily, then prednisolone 40–50 mg PO as clinically improved  
- **Proton-Pump Inhibitors (PPI)**:
  - 20-40 mg IV omeprazole OD (alternative to anti-emetics or in combination)  

Thromboprophylaxis is important if admission extends beyond day care.

**Discharge Advice**:

- Prescribe oral anti-emetics (e.g., metoclopramide) for continued use as needed.  
- If >3 admissions occur, consult a consultant obstetrician regarding corticosteroids post-first trimester (associated with cleft palate).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

**Discharge Advice**:

- Eat small, regular meals  
- Opt for high-carbohydrate, low-fat foods  
- Avoid triggers (food/smells)  
- Ensure adequate rest  
- Ginger may be beneficial
