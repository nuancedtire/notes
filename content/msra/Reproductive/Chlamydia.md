_Chlamydia trachomatis_  
- Most common sexually transmitted bacteria  
- Highest incidence in 15-24 age group  

### Diagnosis  
- Can infect genital tract and conjunctiva (both sexes)  
- Can cause rectal and pharyngeal infection  

**Male Infection:**  
- Accounts for 35-50% of non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU).  
- Incubation: 1-3 weeks.  
- Symptoms: Dysuria, urethral discharge (in ~50% of cases).  

**Female Infection:**  
- Up to 80% are asymptomatic.  
- Symptoms:  
  - Altered [[msra/Reproductive/Vaginal discharge|Vaginal discharge]]  
  - Intermenstrual/postcoital bleeding (IMB/PCB)  
  - Superficial dyspareunia  
  - Low abdominal pain  
- Signs:  
  - Mucopurulent cervicitis (purulent discharge from cervix)  
  - Oedema  
  - Erythema  
  - Friability  
- Complications:  
  - [[msra/Reproductive/Pelvic inflammatory disease|Pelvic inflammatory disease]] (PID) in 10-20% of untreated cases  
  - PID can cause chronic pelvic pain, increase risk of [[msra/Reproductive/Ectopic Pregnancy|Ectopic Pregnancy]], and [[Infertility]].  

**Diagnosis Method:**  
- Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) on urine or vaginal swab samples.  

### Investigations  
- Light microscopy: May show neutrophils, but not _C. trachomatis_ on Gram staining.   
- Useful for ruling out gonococci in male urethral swabs.  
- NAAT.  

### Management (Prescribing)  
- **First-line antibiotics:**  
  - Doxycycline 100 mg BD for 7 days (not for pregnant patients)  
  - Azithromycin (safe in pregnancy)  

- **Second-line agents:**  
  - Erythromycin (safe in pregnancy)  
  - Ofloxacin (not for pregnant patients)  
  - Test of cure recommended 3-5 weeks after treatment with 2nd line agents or in pregnant women.  

### Management (Non-Prescribing)  
- Avoid sexual contact until treatment is completed by patient and partners.  
- Contact tracing and partner notification.
