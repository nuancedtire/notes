### Cervical Cancer Overview

- **Incidence**: 
  - 14th most common cancer in UK women.
  - ~75% diagnosed at stage I or II.

### Diagnosis

- **Age Factors**: 
  - Incidence peaks at ages 30-34 after rising from 20-24, then declines.
  
- **Clinical Features**: 
  - Blood-stained [[msra/Reproductive/Vaginal discharge|Vaginal discharge]], abnormal bleeding (postcoital, intermenstrual, postmenopausal).
  - On pelvic exam: inflamed cervix, bleeding on contact, possible mass.

- **Risk Factors**: 
  - HPV infection (serotypes 16, 18, 33); immunocompromised state (e.g., HIV), smoking, early sexual activity, multiple partners, no condom use.
  - UK vaccination for HPV 16, 18 (and 6, 11 for genital warts) for ages 12-13.

### Investigations

- **Colposcopy**:
  - Urgent referral if cervical cancer suspected.
  - Indicators: white staining with acetic acid, abnormal vascularity.
  - **Biopsy** for histological diagnosis; pre-invasive disease termed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
  - Most common invasive cancers: [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] (80%), adenocarcinoma.

### Screening

- **Eligibility**: 
  - Offered to those aged 25-64 with a cervix in England.
  - Ages 24-49: every 3 years; ages 50-64: every 5 years.

- **Process**: 
  - First line: high-risk HPV screening.
    - HPV negative: routine screening.
    - HPV positive: cytology performed (microscope evaluation for abnormal cells).
    
- **Cytology Results**:
  - Negative: Repeat HPV screening after 12 months.
    - If negative: Return to routine screening.
    - If positive: Repeat after another 12 months; if still positive, refer to colposcopy.
  - Positive cytology leads to colposcopy for CIN or cervical cancer diagnosis and treatment.

### Management

- **CIN**: 
  - Surveillance/excision to prevent progression to invasive cancer.
  - Follow-up: colposcopy 6 months post-treatment. If HPV negative, repeat cytology in 3 years.

- **Cervical Cancer Management**: 
  - **Stage IA1**: cone biopsy or LLETZ.
  - **Stages IA2-IIA**: 
    - Tumours ≤ 4 cm: radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy.
    - Tumours > 4 cm: chemoradiotherapy.
    - Fertility-sparing option: radical trachelectomy.
  - **Stage IIB-IVA**: chemoradiotherapy.
  - **Stage IVB**: combination chemotherapy.
