## Syphilis Overview

- **Cause**: Treponema Pallidum (spirochete).
- **Transmission**: 
  - Through cuts/breaks in mucosa during sexual contact.
  - Contaminated [[Skin lesions]] or needles.
  - Congenital transmission: early signs include hepatosplenomegaly, mucous membrane ulceration, and rhinitis.

## Diagnosis (Stages of Infection)

1. **Primary Stage**:
   - 1-3 weeks post-infection.
   - Presence of chancre (painless ulcer at contact site, often on cervix in women).
   - Localized non-tender lymphadenopathy.
   - Can progress to secondary syphilis in 6-10 weeks if untreated.

2. **Secondary Stage**:
   - Systemic symptoms: fever, malaise, generalized lymphadenopathy.
   - Non-itchy maculopapular/pustular rash (trunk, palms, soles, not face).
   - Painless condylomata (genital warty lesions).

3. **Tertiary Syphilis**:
   - Granulomatous lesions (gummas) in bones, skin, heart, liver, CNS.
   - Argyll-Robertson pupil.
   - Symptoms: Tabes dorsalis, general paralysis of the insane.

4. **Latent Syphilis**:
   - Disease is mostly clear but small number of spirochetes remain.
   - Immune response can trigger tertiary syphilis.

## Investigations

- **Antibody Testing**: Serum analysis for antibodies, but cannot distinguish between current and past infections.
- **Dark-Field Microscopy**: Swab of lesion; if negative, take 3 samples on different days for confirmation.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **First-line Treatment**: IM single dose 1.8g benzylpenicillin.
- **Alternative (Allergy)**: Doxycycline.
- **Jarisch-Herxheimer Reaction**: May occur post-treatment (fever, rash, tachycardia); manage with prednisolone.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- Screen sexual contacts for syphilis and provide treatment if follow-ups may be problematic.
