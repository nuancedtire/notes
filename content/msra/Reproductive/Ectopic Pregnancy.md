Ectopic pregnancies are characterized by an embryo implanting outside the endometrium, occurring in approximately 1-2% of pregnancies. Most are non-viable and present risks of maternal morbidity and mortality due to possible rupture.

### Diagnosis
- Consider ectopic in women of reproductive age with abdominal pain/vaginal bleeding until a negative pregnancy test rules out pregnancy.
- Common symptoms include:
  - Amenorrhoea (6-8 weeks)
  - Pain (mild, unilateral, lower abdomen)
  - Vaginal bleeding (small, brown)
  - Diarrhoea/vomiting
  - Dizziness/light-headedness
  - Shoulder-tip pain (due to haemoperitoneum)
  - Haemodynamic instability (if ruptured)
  - Pelvic exam: Cervical excitation; avoid checking for adnexal mass due to rupture risk.

#### Risk Factors
Present in 25-50% of women:
- Prior ectopic pregnancy (recurrence 10-20%)
- Assisted reproductive technology
- Pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis
- Pelvic/tubal surgery
- Smoking

- Diagnosis is confirmed via ultrasound identifying adnexal mass or through surgery. Most common location is the fallopian tube; non-tubal locations include cervix, caesarean scar, abdominal cavity, ovary. Heterotopic pregnancies (ectopic + intrauterine) are rare.

### Investigations
- **Urine Pregnancy Test**
- **Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUS)** if positive pregnancy test
- **β-hCG levels**: >1,500 IU/ml suggests ectopic in absence of intrauterine pregnancy. Serial measurements for unknown location pregnancies.

### Management
Collaborate with a consultant gynaecologist considering patient circumstances. Management options include:

1. **Conservative/Expectant**
   - Ectopic may pass or reabsorb.
   - Serial hCG: Repeat on days 2, 4, 7; if levels don’t drop ≥15%, consider medical/surgical options.

2. **Medical**
   - Methotrexate IM to halt tissue growth.
   - Monitoring: Serial hCG levels, FBC, LFT.
   - Alcohol abstinence for 2 weeks and contraception for 3 months (methotrexate is teratogenic).

3. **Surgical**
   - **Stable:** Laparoscopic salpingectomy; salpingostomy if other tube is damaged.
   - **Unstable:** ABC assessment and emergency surgery (laparoscopic or laparotomy).

#### Future Pregnancies
- 70% of women without subfertility history achieve successful pregnancies post-ectopic, irrespective of management type. Lower rates in subfertile patients requiring surgical management.
- Rhesus-negative women need anti-D prophylaxis only post-surgical management.
