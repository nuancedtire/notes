- **Breast Fibroadenoma**
  - Most common benign breast growth.
  - Occurs in women of reproductive age.
  - Consists of stromal and epithelial tissue from duct lobules, often linked to oestrogen surge (e.g., pre-menstruation).
  - Very unlikely to become malignant; 30% may shrink over 2 years.

## **Diagnosis**
- Examination:
  - Highly mobile, rubbery, well-defined lesion (often <5cm).
  - Commonly found in the upper outer quadrant of the breast.
  - Can be multiple; family history is significant.

## **Investigations**
- **Triple Assessment Technique:**
  - **Examination:**
    - Inspect breasts with patient seated/standing, raise arms.
    - Palpate with arms behind the head when lying down, using circular motion over breast tissue and axilla.
  
  - **Imaging:**
    - **Mammography (>40 y/o):** Shows popcorn-like calcifications, well-defined mass.
    - **Ultrasound (<35 y/o):** Shows well-defined mass.
  
  - **Fine-needle aspiration:** Shows fibrous/glandular tissue, indicated if imaging findings are atypical.

## **Management (Prescribing)**
- Minimal malignant risk; mainly requires monitoring.
- Impalpable fibroadenomas with benign imaging/biopsy managed with imaging surveillance (consider 6-12 month intervals).

## **Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- Indications for excision:
  - Fibroadenoma >3cm in diameter.
  - Patient preference.
  - New fibroadenoma in patients >40; excision biopsy considered due to increased cancer risk with age.
- Fibroadenomas that enlarge or show atypical imaging characteristics should receive repeat biopsy or excisional biopsy.
- Options for removal: Lumpectomy or excisional biopsy.
