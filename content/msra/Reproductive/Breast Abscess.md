- **Definition**: A breast abscess is an encapsulated collection of pus in the breast.

- **Types of Breast Abscesses**:
  - **Lactation Abscess**:
    - Found in breastfeeding women.
    - Typically located peripherally.
  - **Non-lactational Abscess**:
    - Often an extension of periductal mastitis.
    - Located under the areola.
    - May be associated with nipple inversion in immunocompromised women (e.g. diabetes).

- **Incidence**: About 3% of mastitis infections develop into a breast abscess.

- **Common Causative Organisms**:
  - Staphylococcus aureus
  - Escherichia coli
  - Bacteroides
  - Streptococci (alpha, beta, non-haemolytic)

## Diagnosis
- **Signs/Symptoms**:
  - Fever/malaise/nausea (indicative of infective mastitis).
  - Painful, swollen, fluctuating lump with redness, heat, and swelling.
  - Recent history of mastitis.
  - Purulent nipple discharge.

## Investigations
- **Urgent Referral**: Patients with suspected abscess should be urgently referred from primary care to secondary care for diagnosis and management via ultrasound.
  
- **Ultrasound Features**:
  - Hypoechoic collection
  - Absence of vascularity within the abscess
  - Acoustic enhancement (fluid content)
  - Echogenic/[[Vascular]] rim
  
- **Mammography**: Rarely used, mainly to exclude malignancy in:
  - Lactation abscesses in patients over 30.
  - Non-lactation abscesses with prolonged clinical course.
  - May show skin thickening and asymmetric mass/density.

## Management (Prescribing)
- **Post-drainage Antibiotics**:
  - **Non-lactating Abscess**: First-line amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.
  - **Penicillin Allergy**: Erythromycin and metronidazole combination as an alternative.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Urgent Assessment**: Patients need urgent evaluation by general surgeons.
- **Drainage**: Confirmation via ultrasound and drainage through:
  - Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration
  - Surgical drainage
  - Culturing of fluid for appropriate antibiotics.
  
- **Breastfeeding**: Women should continue breastfeeding from the affected breast or express milk until they can resume normal feeding.
