## Painful Periods (Dysmenorrhoea)

### Classification
| [[Dysmenorrhoea]] | Primary | Secondary |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| **Definition** | Recurrent, crampy, midline lower abdominal pain during menses without demonstrable disease | Painful menses due to an underlying disease |
| **Cause(s)** | Prostaglandins from the endometrium causing uterine contractions, ischemia, and pain | Disease causing pain |
| **Clinical Features** | - Begins during adolescence (4-5 years after first period)<br>- Crampy suprapubic pain starting with menses, lasting 12-72 hours<br>- May include nausea, diarrhea, fatigue, headache, malaise<br>- Improves with age | - Begins later in life<br>- Worsens over time<br>- Improves with treatment/resolution of underlying cause |

### Diagnosis
- Based on medical history and physical examination.
- Internal pelvic examination deferred for young, non-sexually active adolescents with mild cramps.
- Rule out other disorders for primary dysmenorrhea diagnosis:
  - Symptoms: recurrent, crampy, midline pelvic pain correlating with menses.
  - No evidence of other disorders.
- Secondary dysmenorrhea involves identifying underlying causes (e.g., [[msra/Reproductive/Pelvic inflammatory disease|Pelvic inflammatory disease]], [[msra/Reproductive/Endometriosis|Endometriosis]]).

### Investigations
- Pelvic ultrasound (preferably vaginal)
- Vaginal swabs (microbiological testing for [[msra/Reproductive/Pelvic inflammatory disease|Pelvic inflammatory disease]])
- Urine pregnancy test (checking for [[msra/Reproductive/Ectopic Pregnancy|Ectopic Pregnancy]])
- Urinalysis (checking for urinary tract infection)

### Management (Prescribing)
**Goal:** Sufficient pain relief for usual activities.

#### Non-Pharmacological Interventions
- Exercise
- Heat application

#### Pharmacological Therapies
- **NSAIDs:**  
  - First-line (Ibuprofen, Mefenamic acid, Naproxen)  
  - If ineffective, consider:  
    - Different NSAID  
    - Hormonal contraceptives  
    - Combination of both
- **Hormonal Contraceptives:**  
  - As effective as NSAIDs if [[Contraception]] is desired  
  - No preferred formulation; if ineffective, consider alternatives.

#### Supportive Therapies
Evidence is weak; may be used in moderation.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- For those not responding to NSAIDs/hormonal [[Contraception]]:
  - Second-tier options: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists/antagonists.
  - If unsuccessful, consider laparoscopy.
  
### Persistent Symptoms
- Likely indicative of gynecologic disease such as [[msra/Reproductive/Endometriosis|Endometriosis]]; diagnostic laparoscopy advised.
- For heavy menstrual bleeding with persistent dysmenorrhea, endometrial ablation may be an option; hysterectomy for definitive treatment post-childbearing.
