A hydrocele is a fluid collection in the tunica vaginalis surrounding the testes and is a common cause of painless scrotal swellings.

### Diagnosis

#### Types of Hydrocele
- **Communicating**  
  - More common in children  
  - Caused by fluid from the abdominal cavity entering the space (patent processus vaginalis)  
  - Rare in adults; may occur due to:  
    - Ascites  
    - Peritoneal dialysis  
    - Fluid overload ([[Nephrotic syndrome]], [[Heart failure]])  
- **Non-communicating**  
  - More common in adults  
  - Arises from increased secretion of fluid from the tunica vaginalis  
  - Often idiopathic, but may result from:  
    - Trauma (minor trauma, [[Testicular Torsion]], [[Varicocele]] operation)  
    - Infection ([[Epididymitis]])  
    - Testicular tumor  

#### Clinical Features
- **History**  
  - Painless scrotal swelling (may be painful if infected or due to another cause)  
- **Examination**  
  - Soft scrotal swelling  
  - Palpable testes (may be difficult if hydrocele is large)  
  - Positive transillumination test (fluid will illuminate with light)  

### Investigations
- Generally, no investigations needed if diagnosis is clear from history and examination.  
- Ultrasound is indicated if:  
  - Diagnosis is uncertain (differentials include inguinal hernia, [[Testicular Cancer]], [[Epididymitis]], epididymo-orchitis, [[Epididymal cyst]], [[Testicular Torsion]])  
  - Testes cannot be palpated  
  - Symptoms suggestive of underlying pathology (fever, GI symptoms, shadow on transillumination, tenderness)  

### Management

#### Non-pharmacological
- In adults, conservative management is advised after ruling out underlying causes:  
  - Reassurance  
  - Scrotal support  
- Surgical intervention may be necessary if:  
  - Hydrocele is large/uncomfortable  
  - Hydrocele becomes infected  
- Alternatives for patients not eligible for surgery:  
  - Aspiration followed by sclerotherapy  

**Note:** Management for hydroceles in children is not addressed.
