### Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)

- **Definition**: Infection of the female upper genital tract (uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries).
- **Common Cause**: Sexually transmitted infections, mainly chlamydia.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Lower abdominal/pelvic pain (usually bilateral)
  - Fever (acute phase)
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Excessive vaginal discharge
  - Possible peritonitis
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Intrauterine devices (IUDs) increase risk
  - Not recommended for women with a history of PID.
  - Ectopic pregnancy risk must be assessed in similar presentations (pregnancy test essential).
- **Chronic PID**: 
  - Results from untreated acute PID.
  - Symptoms: Chronic pelvic pain, menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia.
  - Diagnosis: Laparoscopy.
- **Treatment**: 
  - Both forms treated with antibiotics and analgesics; chronic response is poorer.
- **Complications**:
  - Acute: Abscesses, peritonitis, septicemia.
  - Long-term: Ectopic pregnancy risk, infertility.
  
### Differential Diagnosis:
- Open-minded approach required for abdominal pain in women of child-bearing age.
- Always consider gynecological and genitourinary causes.

### Ovarian Cysts

- **Overview**: Common, generally asymptomatic, may resolve without treatment.
- **Symptoms**: Chronic pelvic pain, menstrual irregularities.
- **Acute Complications**:
  - Torsion: Ovary rotation causing ischemia.
  - Rupture: Potential for major hemorrhage.
- **Associated Conditions**: More common in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome or endometriosis.
- **Diagnosis**: Primarily through ultrasound scan.
- **Management**:
  - **Emergency Cases**: Analgesia, stabilization, potential surgery.
  - **Non-Emergency**: Analgesia and monitoring; elective surgery for persistent severe cases.
- **Malignancy Risk**: Primarily benign but possibility of cancer; higher in post-menopausal women.
