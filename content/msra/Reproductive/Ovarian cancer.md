## Ovarian Cancer Overview

- **Commonality and Mortality**: Second most common gynecologic malignancy; high mortality rate.
- **Average Diagnosis Age**: 63 years (younger in hereditary cases).
- **Lifetime Risk**: ~1.3% in the general population.

## Types of Primary Ovarian Cancer

- **Epithelial Tumors (95%)**: Primarily referred to as ovarian cancer.
  - Serous carcinoma
    - High grade (70%)
    - Low grade (<5%)
  - Endometrioid carcinoma (10%)
  - Clear cell carcinoma (10%)
  - Mucinous carcinoma (3%)
- **Germ Cell Tumors**
  - Malignant teratoma
  - Dysgerminoma
  - Choriocarcinoma
  - Endodermal sinus tumor (yolk sac tumor)
  - Embryonal carcinoma
- **Sex Cord-Stromal Tumors**
  - Granulosa cell tumors

- **Secondary Metastases**: Involve both ovaries; common sites include breast, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, fallopian tubes, and peritoneum.

## Risk and Protective Factors 

| **Risk Factors** | **Protective Factors** |  
|------------------|-----------------------|  
| Increasing age    | Previous pregnancy     |  
| Early menarche    | History of breastfeeding|  
| Late menopause     | Oral contraceptive use |  
| Infertility       | Tubal ligation        |  
| Nulliparity       | Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy |  
| Endometriosis     | Hysterectomy          |  
| Hereditary syndromes (BRCA, Lynch) |  |  

## Clinical Presentation

- **Subacute (more common)**:
  - Pelvic/abdominal pain
  - Bloating, early satiety, abdominal distension
  - Incidental pelvic/adnexal mass
  - Vaginal discharge (clear or blood-tinged)
  - Menstrual disturbances
  - Weight loss, appetite loss

- **Acute (advanced stage)**:
  - Acute abdomen (torsion, rupture, bleeding)
  - Dyspnea (pleural effusion)
  - Bowel obstruction

## Differentials for Adnexal Mass

### Gynaecological

- **Ovarian**: 
  - Benign: Functional cyst, corpus luteal cyst, theca lutein cyst, polycystic ovaries, endometrioma, cystadenoma, benign germ cell tumors, benign sex cord-stromal tumors.
  - Malignant: Epithelial carcinoma, borderline neoplasm, malignant germ cell tumors, malignant stromal tumors.

- **Tubal**: 
  - Benign: Ectopic pregnancy, hydrosalpinx.
  - Malignant: Epithelial carcinoma, serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasia.

- **Extra-ovarian/Tubal**: 
  - Benign: Paraovarian/paratubal cyst, uterine leiomyoma, tubo-ovarian abscess.
  - Malignant: Metastatic endometrial carcinoma.

### Non-Gynaecological 

- **Benign**: Constipation, appendiceal abscess, diverticular abscess, pelvic abscess, pelvic kidney.
- **Malignant**: Appendiceal neoplasm, bowel neoplasm, metastasis (breast, colon, lymphoma).

## Modes of Spread

- Trans-coelomic
- Direct invasion
- Lymphatic
- Hematogenous 

## Diagnosis

- **Histopathological Diagnosis**: Confirmed post-surgery (ovary/fallopian tube removal or peritoneal biopsy).
- **Surgical Procedure**: Total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (THBSO) and lymph node dissection for staging.
- **Staging** (FIGO/TNM classification):
  - Stage 1: Limited to ovaries
  - Stage 2: Pelvic extension
  - Stage 3: Abdominal localized metastases
  - Stage 4: Distant metastases

## Investigations

- **Routine Preoperative Workup**:
  - Full blood count, renal/liver function tests.
  - PT/PTT, group and cross match.
  - Electrocardiogram, chest X-ray.

- **Tumor Markers**:
  - CA-125 (useful for response monitoring).
  - Alpha-fetoprotein, hCG, lactate dehydrogenase for other cancer types.

- **Radiological Investigations**:
  - Ultrasound pelvis (first-line).
  - MRI pelvis (for unclear ultrasound findings).
  - Chest X-ray, CT abdomen-pelvis (for metastases detection).

## Management

### Prescribing

- **Chemotherapy**: For most patients needing adjuvant treatment (especially stage IC, II, III, IV, high-grade tumors).
- **Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy**: For those unlikely to achieve optimal cytoreduction or unsuitable for surgery.

### Non-Prescribing

- **Surgery**: Total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for low-stage; more advanced cases may require cytoreductive surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy.

## Prognostic Factors for Improved Outcomes

- Younger age
- Low volume of residual disease
- Good performance status
- Serous histology

- **Relapse**: Common in advanced cases, additional treatment depends on relapse timing.

## Genetic Counseling

All patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer should be referred for genetic counseling and testing, regardless of family history.

## Screening

No recommended strategy for average-risk women due to low prevalence and ineffective tests.
