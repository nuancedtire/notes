## Mammary Paget’s Disease Overview

- Rare skin cancer (intraepithelial adenocarcinoma) of the nipple and adjacent areolar skin.
- Often associated with [[Breast cancer]] (invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in situ).

### Diagnosis

- Typically presents in women over 50 years old.
- Symptoms may include:
  - Itchy, eczematous lesion on the nipple (may extend to areolar skin)
  - Redness
  - Swelling
  - Scale formation
  - Nipple discharge (oozing or bloody)
  - Ulceration
  - Nipple inversion
  - Palpable breast lump
- Most cases are unilateral but rare bilateral cases exist.

### Investigations

- Diagnosis via history and examination; confirmed by skin biopsy showing Paget cells.
- Skin biopsy can also reveal underlying breast carcinoma.
- Underlying [[Breast cancer]] may need further investigation using mammography or breast MRI.

### Management

#### Pharmacological

- No specific pharmacological treatment for mammary [[Paget’s disease]].
- Medical treatment may be necessary for underlying [[Breast cancer]].

#### Non-prescribing

- Primary management is surgical:
  - **First-line:** Mastectomy (with or without axillary lymph node dissection) regardless of clinical signs of underlying malignancy.
  - **Alternative options:**
    - Breast-conserving surgery with wide local excision and lymph node biopsy +/- radiotherapy.
    - Conservative options include:
      - Partial nipple excision
      - Wedge excision
      - Cone excision
      - Radiotherapy
    - Note: High recurrence rates with conservative treatments.
