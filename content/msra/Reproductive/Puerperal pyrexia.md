Puerperal pyrexia (fever) is defined as fever (>= 38.0°C) in a woman within six weeks of giving birth.

### Common Sources of Fever
- Pelvic organs
- Urinary tract
- Respiratory tract
- Breasts
- Surgical wound (if any)
- Legs

### Causes and Presenting Features
(Or refer to relevant table)

### Risk Factors
- Lower segment caesarean section (LSCS)
- Prolonged rupture of membranes
- Anaemia
- Genital tract trauma
- Instrumentation
- Ascending infection from bacterial colonisation

### Evaluation
#### History
- Date/time of membrane rupture
- Length of labour
- Any instrumentation used
- Sutures required
- Completeness of placenta removal
- Any bleeding during/after delivery

#### Examination
- Vitals: temperature, blood pressure
- Uterus: size, tenderness
- Perineal wounds and lochia assessment
- Breast examination
- Chest examination for infection
- Abdominal examination
- Calf swelling assessment

### Complications of Infection
#### Local
- Abscess formation (pelvic, breast)
- Adhesions, peritonitis, haemorrhage, [[Infertility]]
- Pyelonephritis, renal scarring

#### Systemic
- Septicaemia, septic shock
- Disseminated intravascular coagulation

### Diagnosis
- Temperature >= 38.0°C within six weeks postpartum.

### Investigations
- High vaginal swab
- Urine cultures and microscopy
- Additional swabs as necessary
- Full blood count (FBC)
- Blood cultures
- Ultrasound for retained products of conception
- Chest x-ray, sputum culture if needed

### Management (Prescribing)
- Administer intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics within one hour of severe [[Sepsis]] suspicion.
- Options include piperacillin/tazobactam or carbapenem + clindamycin (vancomycin if [[MRSA]] suspected).
- Note breastfeeding status.
- Analgesia is important; avoid NSAIDs for GAS infections.
- For severe infections unresponsive to treatment, consider intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).
- Long-term fever may require heparin therapy.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- General measures:
  - Rest, adequate hydration
  - Ice packs application
  - Prophylaxis for close contacts if GAS or meningococcus suspected
- Surgical intervention may be necessary for abscesses.
- Prevention strategies:
  - Hygiene attention during/after delivery
  - Prophylactic antibiotics during LSCS or prolonged labour
  - Minimize catheterisation
  - Prompt cleaning and suturing of perineal wounds
  - Record blood losses and placenta completeness
  - Early mobilisation to prevent venous thrombosis
  - Support for successful breastfeeding skills to reduce mastitis risk.
