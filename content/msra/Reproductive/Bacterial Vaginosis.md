[[cks/Bacterial vaginosis|Bacterial vaginosis]] (BV) Overview:
- **Not an STI** but primarily affects sexually active females.
- **Most common vaginal infection** in women.
- Caused by overgrowth of **anaerobic bacteria** (e.g., Gardnerella vaginalis) leading to depletion of **aerobic lactobacilli** and increased vaginal pH.

### Risk Factors:
- IUDs
- Douching
- Pregnancy

### Complications in Pregnancy:
- Increased risks of:
  - Premature deliveries
  - Low birth weight
  - Chorioamnionitis

### Diagnosis:
- **Asymptomatic in 50%** of cases.
- Common symptom: **fishy/offensive smelling [[msra/Reproductive/Vaginal discharge|Vaginal discharge]]**.
- Other symptoms:
  - Burning sensation during urination
  - Mild itching (usually without vaginal erythema)

### Investigations:
**Amsel’s Criteria** (3 out of 4 needed for diagnosis):
1. Thin, white/grey discharge
2. Positive whiff test (potassium hydroxide + discharge = fishy odor)
3. Vaginal pH >4.5
4. Clue cells on microscopy (stippled vaginal epithelial cells)

### Management (Prescribing):
- **Treatment Options**:
  - Oral metronidazole (5-7 days) – effective in 70-80% of cases.
  - Topical metronidazole or clindamycin can be alternative options.
- **Relapse Rate**: ~50% within 3 months of treatment.
- **Pregnancy Consideration**: Topical clindamycin is not recommended during the first trimester.
