Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, primarily caused by [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|gallstones]] obstructing the gallbladder neck or cystic duct, preventing bile drainage. Rarely, it may result from tumors or parasitic infections. Increased bile secretion in response to the blockage leads to inflammation and distension, compromising vascular supply and causing symptoms like right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain and fever. Infection can follow, particularly in the elderly or those with diabetes, with common pathogens including **Escherichia coli**, **Klebsiella**, **Pseudomonas**, **Enterococcus**, and **Bacteroides fragilis**.

### Diagnosis

**Risk Factors for Cholecystitis:**
- Increasing age
- Females
- Pregnancy
- Obesity/high fat diet
- Diabetes

**Clinical Features:**
- RUQ pain (may radiate to right shoulder)
- Fever
- Nausea
- Anorexia
- Potential jaundice (up to 10% of cases) and infrequent vomiting 

**Examination Findings:**
- **Murphy’s Sign:** Pain upon deep breath in during RUQ pressure
- Localized guarding and tenderness in RUQ
- Palpable RUQ mass in 30% of cases

### Investigations

1. **Basic Observations:** RR, HR, BP, temperature, oxygen saturation 
2. **Blood Tests:**
   - FBC: May show leukocytosis
   - CRP: May be elevated
   - LFTs: Possible elevation of bilirubin, ALT, ALP, GGT
   - Amylase/lipase: To exclude pancreatitis
3. **Imaging:**
   - **Abdominal USS:** Gallbladder wall thickening, distended gallbladder, [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|gallstones]]
   - **CT Abdomen:** For suspected sepsis or perforation

### Complications

1. **Sepsis:** Potential from bacterial infection or gallbladder tissue death. Suspected if patient is acutely unwell. Treatment involves IV antibiotics and monitoring via the Sepsis Six bundle.
   
2. **Mirizzi’s Syndrome:** Compression of the common hepatic duct by impacted gallstone. Causes obstructive jaundice; diagnosed via USS/MRCP. Cholecystectomy indicated.

3. **Gallbladder Perforation:** High mortality risk. Treated initially with IV fluids, IV antibiotics, and percutaneous cholecystostomy. Cholecystectomy can be delayed until the patient is stable.

4. **Gallbladder Empyema:** Distention by pus presents like acute cholecystitis. Detected via CT/MRI, managed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy or percutaneous cholecystostomy if surgery isn't feasible.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Pain Management:** Start with paracetamol and NSAIDs; escalate to opioids if necessary.
- **Nausea Management:** Administer anti-emetics like cyclizine.
- **Fluid Management:** IV fluids for those nil-by-mouth to prevent dehydration.
- **Antibiotics:** Administer IV if infection is suspected.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Dietary Management:** Patient to remain nil-by-mouth.
- **Definitive Treatment:** Laparoscopic cholecystectomy recommended within a week; can also occur 6 weeks post-symptom resolution to reduce complications.
- **Alternative for Unfit Patients:** Percutaneous cholecystostomy for draining the gallbladder in surgical unfit patients.
