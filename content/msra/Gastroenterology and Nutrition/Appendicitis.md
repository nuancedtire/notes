Appendicitis is inflammation of the vermiform appendix, a leading cause of acute abdomen and emergency abdominal surgery worldwide. Untreated, it can lead to ischaemia, perforation, and complications like abscess or peritonitis.

### Diagnosis

- **Incidence:** Common in 2nd and 3rd decades of life, approximately 223/100,000.
- **Common Symptoms:** 
  - Right anterior iliac fossa abdominal pain
  - Anorexia
  - Nausea and vomiting
- **Atypical Presentation:** 
  - Indigestion
  - Flatulence
  - Bowel irregularity
  - Diarrhoea
  - Generalised malaise

- **Early Signs:** 
  - Subtle symptoms
  - Low-grade fever
  - Equivocal abdominal examination

- **Progression Signs:** 
  - Localised tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ)
  - High-grade fever

- **Physical Examination Findings:**
  - **McBurney's Point:** Tenderness 1/3 distance from ASIS to umbilicus
  - **Rovsing's Sign:** Pain in RLQ with palpation of the left lower quadrant
  - **Psoas Sign:** RLQ pain with passive right hip extension
  - **Obturator Sign:** RLQ pain elicited by right hip flexion and internal rotation

- **Alvarado Score:**
  - Migratory RLQ pain (1 point)
  - Anorexia (1 point)
  - Nausea/vomiting (1 point)
  - RLQ tenderness (2 points)
  - Rebound tenderness in RLQ (1 point)
  - Fever >37.5Â°C (1 point)
  - Leucocytosis (WBC >10 x 10^9/L) (2 points)
  
  A score of 0-3 indicates low likelihood of appendicitis.

### Investigations

- **Lab Tests:** Elevated WBC count and CRP (may be mild early on).
- **Pregnancy Test:** For women of childbearing age.
- **Imaging:** 
  - Preferred: CT (highest diagnostic accuracy in adults)
  - Alternatives: Ultrasound (US) or MRI for radiosensitivity concerns (children/pregnant women)
  - Plain X-ray: Usually not helpful.

### Management

#### Emergencies:
- **Perforated Appendix:**
  - **Unstable:** Immediate appendicectomy and IV antibiotics.
  - **Stable (abscess):** IV antibiotics, percutaneous drainage, or appendicectomy at a later date.

#### Prescribing:
- **Antibiotics:** Broad spectrum for gram-negative rods and anaerobes, guided by local guidelines.

#### Non-Prescribing:
- Evidence suggests antibiotics alone may suffice for uncomplicated appendicitis, but appendicectomy remains the gold standard. 
- **Surgical Approach:** Appendicectomy can be open or laparoscopic, with laparoscopic being preferred in most western hospitals.
