## Pancreatic Cancer Overview

- **Types**: 
  - Carcinoma of the head, body, tail of the pancreas
  - Neuroendocrine tumors
- **Prognosis**: Poor due to early metastasis to liver, peritoneum, lungs.

## Diagnosis

- **Incidence**: 9 per 100,000 annually; common in 7th & 8th decades; no gender difference.
- **Types**: 
  - 95% adenocarcinomas, 3% neuroendocrine tumors.
  - Infiltrating ductal adenocarcinoma (90% of cases).
- **Survival**: <5% at 5 years.

### History

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Smoking, obesity, red meat intake, diabetes, alcohol.
  - Family history (BRCA1, BRCA2, FAP, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, MEN1).
  - Chronic pancreatitis (5-15x risk).
  - Hereditary pancreatitis (50-70x risk).

### Symptoms

- **Common**:
  - Abdominal pain (epigastric, may radiate to back).
  - Jaundice (especially with head of pancreas carcinoma); dark urine, pale stools, pruritus.
  - Anorexia; acute weight loss.
  - Ascites.
  - Nausea, vomiting, malaise.

- **Other Potential Symptoms**:
  - Paraneoplastic syndromes (thromboembolic disease).
  - Neuroendocrine symptoms:
    - Insulinoma: Hypoglycemia, confusion.
    - Gastrinoma: Peptic ulceration.
    - Glucagonoma: Necrolytic migratory erythema.
    - Somatostatinoma: Diabetes, anemia, postprandial fullness.

- **Physical Signs**:
  - Courvoisier’s sign (palpable gallbladder + painless jaundice).
  - Virchow’s node (enlarged supraclavicular lymph node).

## Investigations

### Blood Tests

- **LFTs**: 
  - Hyperbilirubinaemia (head of pancreas, liver metastasis).
  - Raised ALP, GGT (obstructive picture).
  - Anemia of chronic disease, thrombocytosis.
  - CA19-9 marker (limited diagnostic value).

### Imaging

- **Ultrasound**: Shows dilated bile ducts, lymph nodes, liver metastasis; sensitive (76-85%).
- **CT Scan**: Preferred for unexplained symptoms, staging.

### Staging

- **TNM Classification**:
  - **T**: Ranges from TIS to T4.
  - **N**: Ranges from N0 to N1.
  - **M**: Ranges from M0 to M1.
  
- Tumor biopsy essential for neuroendocrine tumors.

### Grading

- Exocrine pancreatic cancers: G1 (most normal) to G4 (most aggressive).

## Management

### Prescribing

- Chemotherapy and radiotherapy by specialists; palliation as needed.

### Non-Prescribing

- **Referral**: Urgent two-week wait to pancreatic cancer center or gastroenterology.
  
- **Surgery**: 
  - Possible in 10-20% of cases.
  - Options include:
    - Whipple’s (pancreaticoduodenectomy).
    - Modified Whipple’s (with pylorus preservation).
    - Distal pancreatectomy (for body/tail tumors).
  
- **Adjuvant Treatment**: Chemotherapy improves 5-year survival.

### Unresectable Disease

- Surgical bypass or biliary stenting to relieve obstructive jaundice symptoms.
