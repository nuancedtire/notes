**Diverticular Disease Overview**
- **Diverticulosis**: Formation of colonic diverticula.
- **Diverticulitis**: Inflammation of diverticula.

**Colonic Diverticula**
- Out-pouchings of colonic mucosa and sub-mucosa, typically found in the sigmoid colon (85% of cases), but can also appear in the ascending colon (more common in Asian patients).

**Diverticulitis Complications**
1. **Perforation**:
   - Pericolic abscess (infection leaks into pericolic tissues).
   - Generalized peritonitis (infection leaks into peritoneum).
2. **Fistula Formation**: Damage to nearby structures.
3. **Fibrosis and Bowel Obstruction**: Localized damage to bowel wall.
4. **Hemorrhage**: Erosion of blood vessel in colon wall.

### Diagnosis
- Often asymptomatic; present in approx. 50% of patients >50.
- Symptoms can be mild (altered bowel habit, constipation, abdominal bloating) or severe (left lower quadrant colicky pain, relieved by defecation).

**Risk Factors**
- Low dietary fiber intake.
- Age > 50.
- Smoking.
- BMI > 30.

**Signs in Acute Diverticulitis**
- Fever.
- Left lower quadrant tenderness or guarding.
- Left lower quadrant mass from pericolic abscess.
- Pelvic tenderness on rectal examination.

### Investigations
- First-line: Full Blood Count with White Cell differential (raised neutrophil count).
- Non-specific inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) will be raised.
- Imaging: Abdominal CT preferred; alternatives include ultrasound or barium contrast enema.

### Management of Emergencies
- Surgical intervention required for:
  - **Perforation**: Severe pain, peritonism, unwell patient.
  - **Fistula**: Symptoms vary by affected structure.
  - **Obstruction**: Constipation, abdominal distension, vomiting.
  - **Hemorrhage**: PR bleeding, hypovolaemia signs, iron deficiency anaemia signs for chronic cases.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Asymptomatic Diverticulosis**: No treatment required.
- **Symptomatic Diverticulosis**: Increase dietary fiber and hydration.
- **Diverticulitis** (with infection): 
  - Analgesia (avoid constipating medications).
  - Broad-spectrum oral antibiotics for Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. 
  - If no improvement after 72 hours, consider hospitalisation and IV antibiotics.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Diverticulitis with Complications**:
  - Surgical management with antibiotics and analgesia.
  - Indications for surgery: Perforation, pericolic abscess >3cm, fistula formation, obstruction.
- **Acute PR Bleeding**: Managed with endoscopic haemostasis; angiographic embolization if needed; surgery if bleeding persists.
