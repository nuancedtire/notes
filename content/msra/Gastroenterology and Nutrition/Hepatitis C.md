- **Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Overview**
  - Single-stranded RNA virus (Flaviviridae family).
  - Can cause acute (self-limiting) and chronic hepatitis.
  - Chronic infection can lead to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation.
  - Main transmission: blood and bodily fluids; no vaccine available.
  - 85-90% of asymptomatic patients develop chronic liver disease; 48-75% of symptomatic patients may develop it.

- **Extrahepatic Manifestations**
  - Includes: arthritis, cryoglobulinaemia, porphyria cutanea tarda.
  - Higher incidence of diabetes, associations with lichen planus, sicca syndrome, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

- **Pathophysiology**
  - Th2 cytokines promote fibrosis; Th1 cytokines are antifibrotic.
  - Dominant Th2 response can lead to rapid fibrosis.

### **Diagnosis**
- **Acute Infection**
  - Most asymptomatic; ~10% experience mild flu-like illness.
  - Often diagnosed years later during routine checks.

- **Chronic Infection**
  - Usually asymptomatic; discovered via routine biochemical tests.
  
- **Testing Criteria**
  1. High-risk asymptomatic individuals.
  2. Individuals with indicative clinical features (e.g., malaise, fatigue, jaundice).
  3. Abnormal liver function tests (ALT >10x normal).

### **Investigations**
- Check HCV RNA and antibodies.
- Arrange baseline investigations:
  - HCV RNA test and genotyping.
  - Full blood count.
  - Liver function tests (ALT, GGT).
  - Clotting screen, HbA1c level, thyroid function tests, ferritin level.
  - Hepatitis B and HIV tests.

### **Management (Prescribing)**
- **Antiviral Therapy**
  - All chronic HCV patients eligible, managed by specialists.
  - Treatment duration and type depend on genotype, viral load, liver disease severity, comorbidities.
  - Common regimens: pegylated interferon + ribavirin; triple therapy for genotype 1.
  - Cure rate >99% with sustained viral response.

- **Liver Transplantation**
  - Recommended for end-stage liver disease.

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- **Acute Infection**
  - Monitor for 2-3 weeks; treatment if HCV RNA level doesn’t decline.
- **Referral and Support**
  - Same-day assessment for suspected acute infection; urgent referral for chronic infection.
  - Provide support resources: British Liver Trust, Hepatitis C Trust.
- **Lifestyle Advice**
  - Reduce alcohol intake, quit smoking, maintain healthy weight/diet.
- **Reporting**
  - Notify local Health Protection Team of suspected acute viral hepatitis.
