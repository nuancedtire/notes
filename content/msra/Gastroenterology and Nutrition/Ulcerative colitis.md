## Ulcerative Colitis Overview

- **Age Peaks:** 15-25 years and 55-65 years
- **Nature:** Autoimmune condition
- **Associated Conditions:** Other autoimmune diseases (e.g., thyroid disease, Addison’s disease), HLA-B27 positivity
- **Colonoscopy Findings:** Continuous inflammation starting from the rectum with no skip lesions
- **Smoking:** Protective effect against UC; higher prevalence in ex- or never-smokers
- **Association:** Linked to primary sclerosing cholangitis (presents with jaundice and bile duct beading on MRCP)

## Diagnosis

### History 
- Lower left quadrant pain (crampy)
- Diarrhea
- Rectal bleeding/blood in stool
- Tenesmus (incomplete bowel evacuation)

### Investigations

#### Colonoscopy
- Inflammation starts in the rectum and ascends the colon, visible as diffuse erythema with friable & bleeding submucosa
- Inflammation confined to submucosa (no strictures, fistulas, or fissures)
- Appearance of “pseudopolyps”: normal mucosa islands amidst ulcerated submucosa

#### Histology
- Neutrophils invasion -> crypt abscesses
- Goblet cell destruction -> mucin depletion
- Krarely found granulomas (unlike in Crohn’s disease)
- Barium enema (not routine): shows loss of haustra, ‘drainpipe’ colon in long-standing disease

## Emergencies

### Toxic Megacolon
- **Definition:** Colonic dilation > 6cm (seen on AXR and preferred CT scan)
- **Management:**
  - IV corticosteroids with supportive care (often in ITU)
  - Avoid anti-motility drugs
  - Consider surgery (abdominal colectomy/pan-proctocolectomy) if no improvement after 72 hours
  - Daily AXRs to monitor resolution of megacolon

## Management (Prescribing)

### Severity Classification (Truelove and Witts' Severity Index)
- **Mild:** < 4 stools/day, minimal blood
- **Moderate:** 4-6 stools/day, varying blood, stable patient
- **Severe:** > 6 bloody stools/day, systemic upset (fever, neutrophilia, high CRP, anemia, tachycardia)

### Mild-Moderate Disease
1. Rectal aminosalicylate (e.g., mesalazine)
2. If persistent after 4 weeks, add oral aminosalicylate
3. After another 4 weeks, if persistent, add oral corticosteroids
   - Corticosteroids: Not for maintenance; aminosalicylates can be used long term

### Severe Disease
1. Admit and administer IV steroids
2. If no improvement after 72 hours, add DMARD (e.g., azathioprine or ciclosporin)
3. Consider surgery if no improvement after another 4 days
4. Following severe relapse or 2 exacerbations in 1 year, prescribe oral azathioprine (monitor TMPT levels, consider mercaptopurine if low)
