## Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)

### Overview
- Most common liver infection globally.
- Symptoms range from none to severe complications (e.g., cirrhosis).
- Double-stranded DNA virus transmitted through:
  - Percutaneous
  - Permucosal
  - Sexual routes.
- Severity influenced by age at infection; perinatal/early childhood is most dangerous.

### Diagnosis
- Many patients (70%) are asymptomatic.
- Key risk factors:
  - Perinatal exposure
  - Sexual transmission (multiple partners, MSM)
  - Intravenous drug use
  - Endemic regions (Asia, Africa)
  - Incarceration
  - Family history of HBV infection
  - Family history of chronic liver disease/HCC

#### Key Symptoms of Acute Infection
- Serum sickness-like syndrome:
  - Fever
  - Chills
  - Malaise
  - Arthralgia
  - Rash (maculopapular or urticarial)

Other symptoms may include:
- Jaundice
- Nausea/Vomiting
- Right upper quadrant pain

#### Chronic Infection Presentation
- Generally asymptomatic unless complications arise:
  - Cirrhosis
  - Hepatocellular carcinoma
  - Liver failure

#### Examination Findings
- Acute symptomatic HBV:
  - Tender hepatomegaly
  - Jaundice
- Chronic infection:
  - May show normal findings or signs of cirrhosis (e.g., palmar erythema, spider angioma, ascites, jaundice, asterixis).

### Investigations
#### First-Line Investigations
- **LFTs:** Elevated ALT/AST, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin; low albumin.
- **FBC:** Microcytic anemia/thrombocytopenia in cirrhosis.
- **U&Es:** Hyponatraemia, raised urea.
- **Coagulation profile:** Normal/elevated.
- **Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg):** Detected ~4 weeks post-exposure; persistent after 6 months indicates chronic infection.
- **Antibody to HBsAg:** Indicates infection resolution/immunity.
- **Antibody to hepatitis B core antigen:** Useful for screening contacts.
- **Hepatitis B e antigen:** Indicates risk of chronic infection.
- **HBV DNA:** Assesses candidacy for antiviral therapy.

#### Additional Investigations
- **Abdominal USS:** Assess for liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, HCC.
- **CT/MRI abdomen:** Diagnose HCC.
- **Liver biopsy:** Grades/stages chronic infection.
- **Transient elastography:** Non-invasive assessment of liver stiffness.
- **Alpha-fetoprotein:** Screen for HCC.
- **Testing for co-infections:** HIV, hepatitis C/D.

### Management
#### Acute Infection
- Severe cases or acute liver failure: Antiviral therapy (entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil/alafenamide) until HBsAg clearance.

#### Chronic Infection
- All require antiviral therapy regardless of cirrhosis (entecavir, tenofovir disoproxil/alafenamide, peginterferon alfa-2a).

#### Non-Prescribing Management
- >95% acute cases managed with supportive care; assess for liver transplant if severe progression occurs.
- Chronic cases should similarly be assessed for transplant needs.
