- **Common Presentation**: Acute diarrhoeal and vomiting illnesses due to gastroenteritis are frequent in children, often occurring in outbreaks within nurseries or schools.

- **Clinical Features**: Characteristics of the illness and participant demographics can help identify the infectious agent (viral or bacterial).

- **Common Infectious Agents**:
  - **Viruses**:
    - **Rotavirus**: Most common in children under 2; included in routine vaccination.
    - **Norovirus**: Affects all ages, leading to outbreaks in institutions. Vomiting is predominant over diarrhoea.
  - **Bacteria**:
    - **Dysentery**: Typically caused by bacteria (e.g., Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella) leading to bloody stools.
    - **Cholera**: Notable for producing watery "rice-water" stools without dysentery symptoms.
    - Bacterial infections are generally more severe and can lead to systemic illness.

- **Treatment**: Most gastroenteritis cases are mild and self-limiting. Management is supportive, focusing on dehydration prevention. Severe cases may require hospital admission.

- **Global Health Impact**:
  - In developing countries, gastroenteritis is a leading cause of child mortality.
  - Bacterial infections are more prevalent and severe in developing regions, contributing to higher risks of life-threatening dehydration due to limited healthcare availability.
