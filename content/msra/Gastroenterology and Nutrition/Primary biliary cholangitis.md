## Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC)

- **Definition**: Chronic, progressive cholestatic disease causing inflammation and destruction of intralobular bile ducts due to autoimmune reaction against cholangiocytes.

- **Aetiology**: Unknown; thought to involve genetic and environmental factors. High concordance in homozygous twins indicates strong genetic influence.

- **Symptoms**:
  - Early stages: typically asymptomatic.
  - Advanced stages: tiredness, itch, jaundice, jaundiced sclera, malabsorption, steatorrhea, vitamin D deficiency.

- **Associated Conditions**: 
  - 70-80% have other autoimmune diseases (e.g., Sjogren syndrome).
  - Gender ratio: M:F = 1:10.
  - Peak incidence: 5th to 7th decade of life.

## Diagnosis Criteria

1. **Laboratory Findings**:
   - Cholestasis (increased ALP, GGT, bilirubin).
   - Anti-mitochondrial antibody positivity (AMA+).
   - Exclusion of other cholestatic causes.

2. **Investigations**:
   - Initial blood tests for bilirubin, ALP, GGT.
   - Serological tests for AMA positivity, immunoglobulin levels (IgM>IgG).
   - Imaging: 
     - Ultrasound (US) – to rule out [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|gallstones]].
     - Cholangio-MRI – to rule out primary sclerosing cholangitis.

3. **Biopsy**: Not required for diagnosis in AMA+ cases but is the gold standard for disease staging.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **First-line Treatment**: Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Effectiveness in mortality reduction remains controversial; stabilizes liver function and slows progression of liver lesions.

- **Symptomatic Treatment**:
  - Pruritus: Cholestyramine (bile salt sequestration) and rifampicin (unknown mechanism).
  - Osteoporosis Prevention: Vitamin D and calcium supplementation.
  - Tiredness: Modafinil.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Liver Transplantation**: Only definitive treatment. Relapse occurs in 25% post-transplant. Indicated for complicated cirrhosis.

- **Common Complications of Cirrhosis**:
  - Ascites.
  - Gastroesophageal varices.
  - Hepatic encephalopathy.
  - Hyperdynamic circulation.
  - Coagulopathy.
  - Anasarca.

- **Life-Threatening Complications**:
  - Portal hypertension.
  - Ascites leading to spontaneous peritonitis.
  - Variceal bleeding with coagulopathy.
  - Hyperammonemia-induced encephalopathy.
  - Infection risk from anasarca.

## MELD Score for Transplantation

- **Purpose**: Prioritize candidates based on instability. Calculates risk using:
  - Dialysis status.
  - Creatinine levels.
  - Bilirubin levels.
  - INR.
  - Sodium levels.

- **Indications for Liver Transplantation in PBC**:
  - Complicated cirrhosis.
  - MELD score > 15.
  - Bilirubin consistently > 3 mg/dL.
  - Refractory itch to medical treatment.
