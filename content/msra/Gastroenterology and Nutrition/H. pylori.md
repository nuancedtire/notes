## Overview of H. pylori

### Characteristics
- Spiral-shaped, microaerophilic, gram-negative bacterium
- Most common chronic bacterial infection; ~50% of the global population
- Often asymptomatic; associated with:
  - Peptic ulcers
  - Chronic gastritis
  - Gastric adenocarcinoma
  - MALT lymphoma

### Diagnosis
- **Common Symptoms of Peptic Ulcers:**
  - Epigastric pain/discomfort, especially post-meal
  - Bloating
  - Nausea/vomiting
  - Early satiety
  - Lack of appetite
  - Fatigue (in cases of bleeding)
  - Dark stools (in cases of bleeding)

- **Red Flag Symptoms:**
  - Weight loss
  - Lymphadenopathy (left supraclavicular, periumbilical, left axillary)

### Investigations
- Diagnosing recommended for symptomatic patients with ulcers; consider for high-risk groups.
  
  **Common Tests:**
  - **Urea Breath Test:** Detects breakdown products in breath after ingesting a solution.
  - **Stool Antigen Test:** Detects H. pylori proteins in stool.
  - **Blood Tests:** Antibody detection; limited use due to accuracy concerns.

- Retesting after treatment is common to confirm infection resolution.

  - Smoking cessation
  - Reducing excessive alcohol intake

- **Surgical Interventions:**
