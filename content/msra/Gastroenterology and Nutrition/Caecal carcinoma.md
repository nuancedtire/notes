Colorectal carcinoma is:

- **Ranking**: 3rd most common cancer; 2nd leading cause of death in the UK (16,000 deaths/year).
- **Caecal Carcinoma**: Accounts for 14% of presentations; most common in patients >60 years.

### Risk Factors
- Neoplastic polyps
- Ulcerative colitis and Crohnâ€™s disease
- Genetic predisposition (FAP, HNPCC)
- Low-fibre diet; high red/processed meat intake
- Alcohol consumption
- Smoking
- Previous colorectal cancer

### Diagnosis

- **Symptoms**: Often asymptomatic; when present: 
  - Weight loss
  - Vague abdominal pain
  - Malaise
  - Iron deficiency anemia (faecal occult blood loss)
  - Palpable right iliac fossa mass
  - Less common: acute [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Appendicitis|appendicitis]], distal ileal obstruction, perforation, hemorrhage, or fistula.

- **Recurrence and Metastasis**: 
  - Local recurrence is common; distal spread via lymphatics, blood, or transcoelomically.
  
- **Staging (TNM System)**:
  - **Primary Tumor (T)**:
    - Tis: carcinoma in situ
    - T1: invades submucosa
    - T2: invades muscularis propria
    - T3: invades subserosa/perirectal tissue
    - T4: invades other organs
  - **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**:
    - N0: no regional nodes involved
    - N1: metastasis to 1-3 nodes
    - N2: metastasis to >3 nodes
  - **Distant Metastasis (M)**:
    - M0: no distant metastasis
    - M1: distant metastasis

- **Stages**:
  - Stage 1: confined to bowel wall
  - Stage 2: grows through outer layer
  - Stage 3: spreads to nearby lymph nodes
  - Stage 4: spreads to other parts of the body

### Investigations

1. **Screening for Asymptomatic Population**:
   - **NHS Bowel Cancer Screening**:
     - Faecal Occult Blood (FOB) test: every 2 years (ages 60-75)
     - Colonoscopy for positive FOB
     - One-off flexible sigmoidoscopy at age 55.

2. **Symptomatic Patients without Rectal Bleeding**:
   - FOB
   - Full Blood Count (FBC) for microcytic anemia
   - Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy following positive FOB/microcytic anemia.

3. **Symptomatic Patients with Rectal Bleeding**:
   - Colonoscopy with biopsy
   - Imaging (CT/X-ray/MRI/PET) for distant metastasis
   - Liver Function Tests (LFTs); tumor markers (CEA, CA-19.9).

### Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies

- **Urgent Referral**:
  - Positive FOB, >40yrs with abdominal pain and weight loss
  - >50yrs with rectal bleeding of unknown source
  - >60yrs with iron-deficient anemia or change in bowel habit

- **Consider Urgent Referral**:
  - Rectal/abdominal mass, anal ulceration
  - <50yrs with rectal bleeding plus lower GI symptoms/weight loss/anemia

- **FOB Testing**:
  - >50yrs with abdominal pain/weight loss
  - <60yrs with change in bowel habit/anemia
  - >60yrs with anemia

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Chemotherapy**: 
  - Adjuvant chemotherapy for stage 3 disease; consider for stage 2 and palliative care for metastatic disease.
  - Standard regimen: FOLFOX (fluorouracil, folinic acid, oxaliplatin).
  - Biological therapies (bevacizumab, cetuximab, panitumumab) may enhance response/survival.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Surgery**: 
  - Radical right hemicolectomy with lymphadenectomy and anastomosis is preferred.
  - Laparoscopic surgery is equally safe compared to open surgery (no difference in survival/disease recurrence).
  - Liver resection for single-lobe metastases without extrahepatic spread.
