Acute mesenteric ischaemia is a sudden blood supply disruption to the bowel due to embolism, thrombosis, or low-flow state, leading to bowel ischaemia. High mortality rate if untreated.

### Common Causes

| Type                  | Percentages | Risk Factors                                                  |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Arterial embolism** | **50%**     | Cardiac causes (AF, post-MI mural thrombosis, prosthetic heart valve)<br>Abdominal/thoracic aneurysm |
| **Arterial thrombosis**| **25%**    | [[Atherosclerosis]]                                             |
| **Non-occlusive disease**| **20%**  | Low flow states (recent cardiac surgery, cardiac failure, renal failure)<br>Hypovolaemic shock<br>Cardiogenic shock |
| **Venous thrombosis** | **< 10%**   | Younger patients (hypercoagulable states)<br>Malignancy<br>Inflammatory conditions (pancreatitis, diverticulitis)<br>Trauma |

### Diagnosis

- **Symptoms:** Acute onset severe abdominal pain disproportionate to findings, diffuse and constant, with nausea/vomiting in ~75% cases.

### Investigations

#### Blood Tests
- **ABG:** Raised lactate, metabolic acidosis
- **FBC:** Raised Hb (plasma loss), raised WCC
- **U&Es:** Monitor kidney function (urea, creatinine, eGFR) for IV contrast use
- **LFTs:** Raised AST, ALT (poor prognosis)
- **Clotting:** Especially if on anticoagulants
- **Amylase:** Ruling out pancreatitis (may also be raised)
- **G&S:** Crossmatch 4 units for potential urgent transfusion

#### Imaging
- **CT Angiography:** Gold standard
- **AXR:** May show small bowel obstruction, ileus, thickened bowel wall (later stages)
- **Erect CXR:** If bowel perforation suspected

**Note:** Early diagnosis is challenging; CT angiography and exploratory laparotomy have high sensitivity.

### Emergency Management

Acute mesenteric ischaemia is a surgical emergency. Main complications include:
- Septic peritonitis
- Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), potentially leading to multi-organ failure.

#### Resuscitation:
- IV fluids
- Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics
- Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)

#### Surgical Intervention:
- Urgent laparotomy to remove necrotic bowel

**Mortality Rate:** Approximately 50-80% despite diagnosis and treatment. Survivors may develop short gut syndrome.

### Management Overview

#### Acute Management (Prescribing)
- IV fluids resuscitation
- Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics
- LMWH

#### Long-term Management
- Possible lifelong anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy.

#### Non-Prescribing Management
- Urgent exploratory laparotomy for necrotic bowel removal
- Revascularisation may be attempted for viable bowel but is complex and often requires a second laparotomy.
