Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms and complications from gastric content reflux into the oesophagus. Key symptoms include heartburn and acid regurgitation, often post-meal. Serious complications: stricture, Barrettâ€™s oesophagus, oesophageal carcinoma.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical diagnosis:** Physical exams typically unremarkable.
- **Common symptoms:**
  - **Heartburn:** Burning sensation in the chest after eating, worsened by lying down or bending.
  - **Acid regurgitation:** Sour/bitter taste after meals.
  
- **Risk factors:**
  - Family history
  - Obesity
  - Older age
  - Hiatus hernia

- **Other factors:**
  - Dysphagia: Investigate further if progressive.
  - Bloating/Early satiety: Rule out cancer or stricture.
  - Globus sensation: Feeling of a lump in the throat.
  - Enamel erosion: Possible cause from acid reflux.
  - Halitosis: More common in GORD patients.
  - Dyspepsia: More prevalent in those with GORD symptoms.

### Investigations
1. **1st Line:** 
   - Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) trial (8 weeks).
   
2. **If no improvement or complicated disease suspected:**
   - Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD): Check for oesophagitis/Barrett's.
   - Oesophageal capsule endoscopy: Less invasive than upper endoscopy.
   - Oesophageal manometry: Evaluate contraction and sphincter function, suggest disorders.
   - Ambulatory pH monitoring: Assess abnormal acid exposure.
   - Combined impedance-pH testing: Quantify acid exposure and reflux events.
   - Barium swallow: For patients with dysphagia or endoscopy contraindications.

### Management

#### Prescribing
- **Initial Treatment:** 
  - PPI 8-week course: (Omeprazole, Esomeprazole, Rabeprazole, Pantoprazole, Lansoprazole, Dexlansoprazole).
  
- **Ongoing Treatment (PPI-responsive):** 
  - Continued PPI (same options).

- **Ongoing Treatment (Incomplete response):** 
  - Continued PPI with adjunct H2 antagonist: (Ranitidine, Famotidine, Nizatidine, Cimetidine).

#### Non-Prescribing
- **Lifestyle Changes:**
  - Weight loss (if overweight).
  - Elevate head of bed.
  - Avoid late-night eating (if nocturnal symptoms).

- **Surgical Options:**
  - Fundoplication (open/laparoscopic) for those responsive to PPIs but unwilling to continue. Not for unresponsive patients.
