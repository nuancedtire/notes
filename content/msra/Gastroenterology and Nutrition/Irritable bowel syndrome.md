Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic condition characterized by:

- Abdominal pain or discomfort
- Change in bowel habit
- Abdominal distention

**Prevalence**: Affects ~15% of adults; few seek medical aid.

### Diagnosis

- **Focus**: History; no specific diagnostic tests.
- **Type**: "Rule out" diagnosis (exclude other causes).
- **Examination**: Usually unremarkable; possible lower quadrant tenderness.

**Common Symptoms**:
- Recurrent abdominal pain/discomfort
- Bowel habit changes related to pain
- Abdominal bloating

**Key Factors**:
- Age <50 years
- Female sex
- History of physical/sexual abuse
- Previous enteric infection
- Stress (home/work)

**Manning Criteria** (3+ symptoms needed, no red flags):
- Pain with more frequent bowel movements
- Looser stools linked to pain
- Pain relieved by stool passage
- Noticeable bloating
- Incomplete evacuation sensation >25% of the time
- Diarrhoea with mucus >25% of the time

**Red Flags** (indicate possible malignancy):
- Age >50 years
- Weight loss
- Blood in stools
- Anaemia
- Fever

### Investigations

Primarily to rule out other causes; normal results expected if IBS is the true diagnosis:

- **FBC**: Check for anaemia
- **Serum CRP**: Differentiate IBS from inflammatory bowel disease
- **Faecal calprotectin**: Differentiate IBS from inflammatory bowel disease
- **Stool studies**: For diarrhoea; check for parasites
- **Coeliac screening**: For diarrhoea/weight loss
- **Plain abdominal x-ray**: Useful for bloating
- **Flexible sigmoidoscopy**: For patients <50 years
- **Colonoscopy**: For patients >50 years

### Management (prescribing)

Aim: Reduce symptom severity to improve quality of life. Medications may vary based on symptoms.

- **Constipation**:
  - 1st line: Laxatives (ispaghula, lactulose, polyethylene glycol)
  - Consider: Lubiprostone, linaclotide, plecanatide if laxatives not tolerated.
  
- **Diarrhoea**:
  - 1st line: Antidiarrhoeals (loperamide, colestyramine)
  - 2nd line: Alosetron, eluxadoline
  
- **Pain/Bloating**:
  - 1st line: Antispasmodics (dicycloverine, hyoscyamine, peppermint oil)
  - 2nd line: Tricyclic antidepressants (desipramine, amitriptyline, doxepin)

### Management (non-prescribing)

Start with conservative strategies focusing on lifestyle and dietary changes:

- **Lifestyle adjustments**: Aim to reduce stress.
- **Dietary modifications**: Low-FODMAP diet has supporting evidence for symptom relief.
