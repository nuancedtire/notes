### Overview of Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)
- Immune-mediated chronic cholestatic disease.
- Primarily affects intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts.
- Pathology includes: inflammation of dominant bile ducts, strictures formation, cholestasis, hepatic fibrosis, and hepatic failure.
  
### **Diagnosis**
- **Incidence:** 1 in 100,000 people/year; mainly affects middle-aged males. 
- **Life Expectancy:** Median of 12 years.
- **Association:** Strongly linked with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), especially Ulcerative Colitis.
- **Symptoms:** Often asymptomatic at diagnosis; progression includes:
  - Right upper quadrant pain
  - Jaundice
  - Pruritus
  - Weight loss
  - Fatigue
- **Physical findings:** Hepatomegaly, jaundice, weight loss, scratch marks.

#### **Complications**
1. Recurrent ascending cholangitis
2. Gallbladder polyps
3. Cholangiocarcinoma (6-13% prevalence)
4. End-stage liver disease
5. Metabolic bone disease
6. Malnutrition

- **Severity Assessment:** Child-Pugh Score.

### **Investigations**
- **Gold Standard:** Cholangiography (MRCP preferred).
- ERCP: Consider if stent insertion/brush cytology needed.
- Cholangiography shows "beaded appearance" due to strictures.
- Other tests:
  - Liver function tests: cholestatic pattern with raised ALP and GGT.
  - Raised bilirubin indicates poorer prognosis.
  - Liver biopsy: not common, but useful for histological staging.
- **Antibody Associations:** Highly associated with p-ANCA.

### **Management of Emergencies**
- **Bacterial Cholangitis:** Rapid progression to sepsis.
- **Presentation:** Worsening jaundice, pruritus, fever, right upper quadrant pain.
- **Urgent Care:**
  - Antibiotics (local guidance).
  - Biliary decompression via ERCP and balloon dilation for severe cases.

### **Management (Prescribing)**
- **First-line Treatments:**
  - Lifestyle changes (limit alcohol).
  - Symptom management:
    - Pruritus: Cholestyramine.
    - Osteopaenia: Calcium & Vitamin D.
    - Osteoporosis: Bisphosphonates; HRT for postmenopausal women.
    - Cholangitis: Antibiotics (local guidance).
    - Malnutrition: Fat-soluble vitamin replacement (A, D, E, K).
- **Other Treatments:**
  - Corticosteroids/immunosuppressants only under specialists for overlapping autoimmune features.
  - Ursodeoxycholic acid: Not routinely recommended; improves liver function tests.

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- **Liver Transplant:** Only treatment with therapeutic benefit; 10-year survival rate ~70%.
- **Indications for Transplant:**
  - Severe pruritus,
  - Recurrent cholangitis,
  - End-stage liver disease (ESLD).
- **Non-responsive Symptomatic Patients:** Biliary decompression via ERCP (preferably balloon dilation).

### **Differentiating PBC and PSC**  

| Feature                       | PBC                                  | PSC                                    |

| **Epidemiology**              | Predominantly affects middle-aged females | Predominantly affects middle-aged males |
| **Structures Involved**       | Mainly interlobular bile ducts       | Dominant extrahepatic/intrahepatic bile ducts |
| **Diagnosis**                 | Positive anti-mitochondrial antibody | MRCP & often positive p-ANCA         |
| **Pathologies**               | Autoimmune                           | Unknown aetiologies                   |
| **Pharmacological Management** | For symptomatic treatment only       | For symptomatic treatment only         |
