### Crohn’s Disease Overview

- **Definition**: Chronic condition with transmural inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract (mouth to perianal area).
- **Features**: Skip lesions (healthy bowel segments between diseased parts) and risk of complications like intestinal obstruction and bowel perforation.

### Diagnosis

- **Methods**:
  - History and exam findings
  - Colonoscopy with ileoscopy and tissue biopsy
  
- **Common Symptoms**:
  - Abdominal pain (cramping/constant)
  - Diarrhoea
  - Gastrointestinal bleeding
  - Weight loss
  - Fatigue
  - Fever
  
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Family history of IBD
  - Ages: 15-40 years or 60-80 years
  - White ethnicity
  - Ashkenazi Jewish descent (2-4x increased risk)

- **Examination Findings**:
  - **Abdominal**: Right lower quadrant tenderness, palpable mass
  - **Oral**: Ulcers
  - **Perineal**: Skin tags, fistulae, abscesses, sinus tracts
  - **Digital rectal**: Occult blood
  - **Skin**: Erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum

### Investigations

- **1st Line Tests**:
  - FBC: anaemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis suggest CD
  - Iron studies: iron deficiency indicates potential bleeding
  - Vitamin B12 and folate: low levels suggest malabsorption
  - Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP): hypoalbuminaemia, hypocholesterolaemia, hypocalcaemia indicate chronic CD
  - CRP/ESR: correlate with inflammation activity
  - Stool testing: absence of infection suggests CD
  - Imaging: abdominal x-ray, CT and MRI to locate disease and identify skip lesions
  - Colonoscopy: definitive for CD; look for aphthous ulcers, hyperaemia, oedema, cobblestoning
  - Tissue biopsy: transmural involvement with non-caseating granulomas

### Emergencies Related to Crohn’s Disease

#### Intestinal Obstruction
- **Aetiology**: Chronic inflammation leading to strictures.
- **Diagnosis**: Symptoms (pain, nausea, vomiting), abdominal exam findings (tenderness, abnormal bowel sounds), imaging (x-ray).
- **Management**: 
  - Partial: nasogastric decompression, corticosteroid therapy.
  - Complete: surgical intervention.

#### Bowel Perforation
- **Aetiology**: Fragile inflamed or obstructed bowel.
- **Diagnosis**: Symptoms (sharp pain, malaise), clinical signs (sepsis, peritonism), imaging (x-ray for free air).
- **Management**: 
  - Start Sepsis 6 treatment.
  - Individualised management; likely requires surgery.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Prescription Management**: Handled by specialists. Tailored to individual patients.
- **Goals**: Achieve and maintain remission; manage symptoms (diarrhoea, pain, malabsorption).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Surgery**: 50% of patients may require surgical intervention for complications or persistent symptoms.
- **Lifestyle Factor**: Smoking cessation is crucial for reducing recurrence.
