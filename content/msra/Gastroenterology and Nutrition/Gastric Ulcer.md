# Gastric Ulcer

A gastric ulcer is a breach in the mucosal lining of the stomach that exceeds 5mm in diameter and penetrates to the submucosal layer. Ulcers are caused by an imbalance between damaging factors (gastric acid, pepsin, _Helicobacter pylori_ infection, NSAID use) and protective mechanisms (prostaglandins, mucus, mucosal blood flow).

**Complications:**

* Common: Gastrointestinal bleeding
* Severe, but less common: Perforation

#### Diagnosis

* Made through history, examination findings, and endoscopy confirmation.

**Common Symptoms:**

* Dyspepsia
* Chronic/recurrent upper abdominal pain
* Pain related to eating/lying flat

**Key Risk Factors:**

* _Helicobacter pylori_ infection
* NSAID use
* Smoking
* Increasing age
* Personal/family history of gastric ulcers

**Examination Findings:**

* Epigastric tenderness

#### Investigations

1st line tests:

* _**H. pylori**_** Tests:** Urea breath test or stool antigen test for patients <55 years. Positive indicates presence.
* **Upper GI Endoscopy:** Most specific/sensitive; detects ulcers and causes (e.g., H. pylori).
* **FBC:** For clinical anaemia or gastrointestinal bleeding; microcytic anaemia suggests gastric ulcers.

#### Management (Prescribing)

**Goals:** Treat complications (e.g., hemorrhage), eliminate underlying causes, relieve symptoms, and heal ulcers.

**Before medication:** Discontinue NSAIDs (including aspirin) if possible.

If _H. pylori_ is present:

* **Triple Therapy (first-line):**
  * Proton pump inhibitor: omeprazole/lansoprazole/rabeprazole/esomeprazole
  * Antibiotic 1: clarithromycin
  * Antibiotic 2: amoxicillin/metronidazole (if penicillin allergic)

For patients with previous macrolide exposure and penicillin allergy:

* **Quadruple Therapy (first-line):**
  * Proton pump inhibitor
  * Bismuth subsalicylate
  * Metronidazole
  * Tetracycline

If _H. pylori_ is absent:

* **1st line:** Proton pump inhibitor
* **2nd line:** H2 antagonist (ranitidine/famotidine/nizatidine)

For patients needing NSAIDs, misoprostol can treat NSAID-induced ulcers.

#### Management (Non-Prescribing)

For actively bleeding ulcers, endoscopy can be employed as both diagnostic and therapeutic using:

* Adrenaline injection
* Cautery
* Clip application

Surgery/embolisation considered if endoscopic intervention fails.

**Lifestyle Modifications:**

* Smoking cessation
* Reduced excessive alcohol intake
