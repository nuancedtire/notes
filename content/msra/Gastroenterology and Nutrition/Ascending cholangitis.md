**Ascending Cholangitis Overview**

- **Condition**: Inflammation of biliary tract
- **Cause**: Stasis and bacterial infection (enteric origin)
- **Culture**: Positive in >90% of acute cases (mix of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria)

**Risk Factors**
- Permanent biliary stent: Slightly Increased Risk
- Intrinsic bile duct obstruction:
  - Common: Biliary stones
  - Less Common: Benign and malignant strictures
- Extrinsic obstruction:
  - Malignancies
  - Acute pancreatitis
  - Mirizzi syndrome
- Parasitic infections: Liver flukes, Ascaris lumbricoides
- Iatrogenic: ERCP (up to 1.7%)

**Diagnosis**

- **Charcot’s Triad**: Fever, jaundice, abdominal pain (50-75% of patients)
  - Fever + abdominal pain alone in 80% 
- Possible symptoms: Hypotension, change in mental status
- Diagnostic methods:
  - Direct ERCP for confirmation and treatment if indicated
  - Transabdominal ultrasound, CT, MRCP, or EUS if ERCP is not appropriate

**Diagnostic Criteria**
1. Fever **OR**
2. Laboratory evidence of systemic inflammation (elevated WBC, CRP)
3. **AND** both:
   - Cholestasis: Bilirubin ≥ 2 mg/dL or abnormal LFTs (≥ 1.5 ULN)
   - Imaging suggestive of biliary dilation or etiology (stone, stent, stenosis)

**Severity Classification**
- **Severe**: Dysfunction in ≥1 systemic area (cardiovascular, neurological, etc.)
- **Moderate**: Presence of 2 of the following:
  - Abnormal WBC count
  - Fever > 39 °C
  - Age ≥ 75
  - Bilirubin ≥ 5 mg/dL
  - Hypoalbuminemia

**Investigations**

- **Blood Tests**:
  - Full Blood Count (FBC): Elevated WBC (neutrophil predominance)
  - Liver Function Tests: Cholestatic pattern (elevated ALP, GGT, conjugated bilirubin)
  - Blood cultures
  - Bile/Stent cultures (if stent removed)

- **Imaging**:
  - Abdominal US: Check for duct dilation/stones
  - Abdominal CT: If US normal
  - MRCP: If both US and CT normal
  - ERCP: For suspicion of biliary obstruction (can be therapeutic)
  - EUS: Alternative to ERCP for high risk patients

**Management (Prescribing)**

- **Supportive care**: IV hydration, electrolyte correction, analgesia
- **Antibiotic therapy**:
  - Empirical based on protocol (community-acquired vs healthcare-associated)
  - Specific therapy upon culture results
  - Duration: 4-5 days post infection control
  - 70-80% response rate to antibiotics

**Management (Non-Prescribing)**

- Monitoring: For septic shock/organ dysfunction
- **Drainage**:
  - Mild to moderate cholangitis: Drain within 24 hours
  - Severe or non-responsive cases: Drain within 48 hours
  - **ERCP**: Preferred for stone extraction/stenting
  - If ERCP not feasible: EUS guidance or percutaneous/surgical options
- Recommendation: Delayed elective cholecystectomy for gallstone-related cases (high recurrence risk)
