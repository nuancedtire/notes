## Gallstone Disease Overview

- **Prevalence:** 15% of the UK population.
- **Types:**
  - Cholesterol gallstones (most common in developed countries, formed from cholesterol crystallisation).
  - Pigment stones (develop in chronic conditions like haemolytic anaemia, cystic fibrosis, cirrhosis, ileal disease).

### Diagnosis

#### Risk Factors (5Fs)
- **Fat:** Obesity, rapid weight loss.
- **Female:** Increased oestrogen (pregnancy/hormonal therapy).
- **Fertile:** Multiparity.
- **Forty:** Age over 40.
- **Family History.**

#### Symptomatology
- **Asymptomatic:** Often found incidentally.
- **Symptomatic (biliary tract):**
  - Biliary colic
  - Acute [[cholecystitis]]
  - Ascending cholangitis

### Complications

#### Biliary Colic
- **Characteristics:**
  - Pain: RUQ or epigastrium, dull, sudden onset, radiates to back/shoulder, lasts >30 mins, <5 hours, precipitated by fatty food.
  - Associated: Nausea, vomiting.

#### Acute [[Cholecystitis]]
- **Symptoms:**
  - Severe persistent pain, fever.
- **Signs:**
  - RUQ tenderness, muscle guarding, rigidity, positive Murphyâ€™s sign, rigors.

#### Ascending Cholangitis
- **Presentation:**
  - Charcotâ€™s triad: RUQ pain, fever, jaundice.
  - Reynoldsâ€™ pentad: Hypotension, confusion.

#### Additional Complications
- Acute pancreatitis
- Gallstone ileus
- Gallbladder empyema
- Increased gallbladder cancer risk
- Mirizzi syndrome

### Investigations

#### Bedside Tests
- Normal observations in biliary colic.
- Tachycardia and fever in [[cholecystitis]]/cholangitis; hypotension in cholangitis.
- Urinalysis (including pregnancy test if applicable).

#### Blood Tests
- **FBC:** Elevated WBC in cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis.
- **CRP:** Elevated in cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis.
- **LFTs:** Elevated ALP, ALT, bilirubin in cholangitis.
- **Lipase/Amylase:** Elevated in acute pancreatitis.

#### Imaging
- **Abdominal ultrasound:** Identify gallstones, assess gallbladder wall, bile duct dilatation.
- **Abdominal CT:** Bile duct dilatation/cholangitis, pancreatic enlargement in pancreatitis.

#### Special Tests
- **For inconclusive ultrasound:** MRCP, EUS.

### Emergency Management

- **Ascending Cholangitis:**
  - Implement Sepsis 6 protocol within 1 hour.
  - Biliary decompression via ERCP within 24-48 hours; may include lithotripsy, balloon dilation, stenting, or laparoscopic exploration if necessary.

### Management Strategies

#### Pharmacological
- Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics for acute cholecystitis and ascending cholangitis.

#### Non-pharmacological
- **Asymptomatic gallstones:** Generally not treated, unless high cancer risk or complications.
- **Cholecystectomy:** 
  - Indicated for biliary colic, acute cholecystitis, ascending cholangitis (within 1 week post-recovery).
  - Preferably laparoscopic due to shorter recovery.
