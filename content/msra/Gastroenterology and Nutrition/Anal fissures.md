## Anal Fissures Overview

- **Definition**: Tears in the skin of the distal anal canal.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Pain on defecation
  - Tearing/burning sensation during bowel movements
  - “Passing glass” sensation
  - Fresh blood observed on stool or when wiping

- **Risk Factors**:
  - STDs (e.g., syphilis, herpes)
  - Crohn's disease
  - Anal cancer
  - Psoriasis
  - Hard stool
  - Chronic constipation
  - Opiate analgesic use
  - Pregnancy

- **Impact**: Significant effect on quality of life; many individuals experience multiple episodes.

### Diagnosis

- **Method**: Primarily clinical based on patient history; usually no further investigations required.
- **Digital Rectal Exam (DRE)**: May help identify the fissure but can cause pain, so patients may decline. It should not be solely relied upon for diagnosis.

### Investigations

- **First-line**: None typically required as the diagnosis is clinical.
- **Second-line** (for chronic fissures):
  - **Anal Manometry**: Measures resting anal sphincter pressure (low in chronic fissures).
  - **Anal Ultrasound**: Detects sphincter defects.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Pain Management**:
  - Recommended: Paracetamol and ibuprofen.
  - Avoid: Opiate analgesia (can worsen constipation).
- **Topical Treatments**:
  - Lidocaine for severe pain.
  - Topical glyceryl trinitrate or diltiazem (avoid in pregnancy/lactation).
- **Stool Softeners/Laxatives**: May be prescribed for easier defecation.
- **Surgical Options for Resistant Fissures**:
  - Botulinum toxin injection (effective post-childbirth).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Lifestyle Modifications**:
  - Increase dietary fiber (whole grains, fruits, vegetables).
  - Maintain adequate fluid intake.
  - Recommend Sitz baths for pain relief.
  
- **Surgical Options**:
  - **Surgical Sphincterotomy**: Cuts/stretching of the internal sphincter; requires prior investigations.
  - **Anal Advancement Flap**: Alternative procedure, less commonly performed.
