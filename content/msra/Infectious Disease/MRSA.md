- **Definition**
  - MRSA: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus
  - Resistant to all beta-lactam antibiotics
  - More difficult to treat than other Staphylococcus aureus infections

- **Types of MRSA Infections**
  - **Healthcare-associated**: Occurs 2 days post-hospitalization or within a year of healthcare receipt.
  - **Community-associated**: Occurs outside of healthcare settings, often affecting skin and soft tissue.

- **Risk Factors for MRSA Infection**
  - HIV infection
  - Long-term care facility residency
  - Hemodialysis
  - High antibiotic use
  - Self-injection drug use

### Diagnosis
- Symptoms vary by infection site (e.g., lungs, heart, joints, blood).
- Common skin symptoms: pain, swelling, redness, warmth (cellulitis/abscess).
- Bacteremia: MRSA found in the blood.

### Investigations
- Detection through culture of body fluids (blood, urine, sputum).
- Cultures show Gram-positive round-shaped bacteria.
- PCR (Polymerase chain reaction): Gold standard for MRSA identification.

### Emergency Management
- **Sepsis**: Can result from MRSA bacteremia, diagnosed with blood culture.
- Management includes:
  - Immediate antimicrobial agents
  - Intravenous fluids
  - Supplemental oxygen
  - Treat underlying causes (e.g., abscess drainage)

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Cellulitis Treatment**:
  - Oral antibiotics: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, tetracyclines, oxazolidinones.
  - Parenteral antibiotics if:
    - Extensive infection
    - Signs of systemic toxicity
    - Persistence/progression of symptoms after 2-3 days of oral antibiotics
    - Immunosuppressed patients
    - Infection near indwelling devices (e.g., vancomycin, daptomycin).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Abscess Treatment**: Incision and drainage.
