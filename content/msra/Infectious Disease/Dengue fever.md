## Dengue Fever Overview

- **Cause**: RNA virus (Flaviviridae family)
- **Transmission**: By Aedes mosquito
- **Serotypes**: Four types; co-infection with multiple serotypes in ~50% of cases
- **Affected Population**: Adults more common for classical disease; severe forms (dengue haemorrhagic fever) more common in children
- **Geographic Prevalence**: Endemic in 100+ countries, mainly tropical regions

## Diagnosis

### Risk Factors
- Recent travel (<2 weeks) to endemic areas
- Vulnerable groups: Pregnant individuals, extremes of age

### Clinical Findings (WHO Classification)

1. **Dengue Fever**:
   - Fever
   - Plus any 2 of:
     - Clinical: Nausea, rash, myalgia/arthralgia
     - Investigative: Leukopenia, positive tourniquet test

2. **Dengue Fever with Background/Warning Signs**:
   - Meets dengue fever criteria
   - Plus any of:
     - Background: Comorbidities, pregnancy, vulnerable age, isolated
     - Clinical: Abdominal pain, vomiting, fluid overload, hepatomegaly, mucosal bleed, lethargy, restlessness
     - Investigative: Raised haematocrit with thrombocytopenia

3. **Severe Dengue Fever**:
   - Meets dengue fever criteria
   - Plus severe:
     - Organ impairment
     - Haemorrhagic phenomena
     - Plasma leakage (dengue shock syndrome ± fluid overload/acute respiratory distress)

## Investigations

### Diagnostic Tests
- **Gold-standard**: RT-PCR
- **In resource-limited settings**: IgM and IgG ELISA
  - Single sample: Positive IgM and IgG suggests dengue
  - Paired samples: Seroconversion indicates confirmation

### Further Blood Tests
- **Full blood count**: Leukopenia, raised haematocrit with thrombocytopenia
- **Liver function tests**: Raised enzymes, hypoalbuminaemia
- **Serology**: Non-structural protein 1 identification via ELISA

### Imaging for Complications
- **Chest X-ray**: Pleural effusion, pulmonary oedema
- **Abdominal Ultrasound**: Ascites

## Emergency Management

### Severe Forms
- **Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever**:
  - Duration: 7-10 days
  - Clinical: Fever, bleeding signs, hepatomegaly, circulatory failure
  - Treatment: Plasma replacement

- **Dengue Shock Syndrome**:
  - Duration: 1-2 days
  - Criteria: Weak pulse + narrow pulse pressure or hypotension + cold/clammy skin
  - Treatment: Volume replacement therapy

## Management (Prescribing)

### Dengue Fever
- Conservative: Rest, oral fluids, analgesia
- Discharge: Stable haematocrit, safety net for warning signs

### Dengue with Relevant Background
- Conservative: Oral fluids, then IV fluids if needed
- Medical: IV fluids (0.9% saline/Ringer’s Lactate), titrate based on clinical response

### Severe Dengue Fever
- **Compensated Shock**:
  - IV fluid resuscitation with crystalloids
  - Titrate based on haematocrit changes

- **Hypotensive Shock**:
  - IV fluid resuscitation with crystalloids/colloids
  - Adjust based on haematocrit and clinical response

- **Haemorrhagic Complications**: Fresh packed red cells or whole blood

### Fluid Management
- Careful fluid replacement to prevent overload

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- Notify Public Health England due to it being a viral haemorrhagic fever
- Monitoring of:
  - Warning signs
  - Observations (temperature, urine output, perfusion)
  - Blood tests (haematocrit, white cell/platelet counts, organ function tests)
