Meningitis Overview
====================
- Inflammation of the meninges (membranes over the brain and spinal cord)
- Classified by pathogen: bacterial, viral, tuberculous, fungal
- Viral meningitis: most common and least severe; resolves with conservative management; no specific treatment

Common Viruses Causing Meningitis
- Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
- Herpes simplex virus (HSV)
- Varicella zoster virus (VZV)
- Human enteroviruses
- Mumps virus

**Key Point:** Distinguish viral meningitis from bacterial meningitis (life-threatening, requires urgent treatment).

Diagnosis
---------
**Symptoms:**
- Headache (most common)
- Photophobia
- Neck stiffness
- Fever
- Nausea and vomiting
- Purpuric rash
- Kernig’s sign (positive if leg can't straighten when supine)
- Brudzinski’s sign (positive if hips/knees flex involuntarily when neck flexed)

**Important Consideration:** 
- A non-blanching rash suggests bacterial meningitis; empirical antibiotics necessary.

**Differential Diagnoses for Headache:**
- Intracranial hemorrhage (e.g., subarachnoid)
- Malignancy (brain tumors)
- Eclampsia/Preeclampsia (in pregnancy)
- Migraine (not life-threatening)

Investigations
--------------
- Blood cultures (3 sets from different sites)
- Lumbar puncture (CSF sample)
- Blood tests: full blood count, inflammatory markers, urea and electrolytes

**Brain Imaging:** CT or MRI for structural changes or neurological pathology.

**CSF Analysis from Lumbar Puncture:**
- Opening pressure
- Appearance
- White blood cell count (WCC)
- Predominant white cell type
- C-reactive protein (CRP)
- Protein
- Glucose
- Lactate

**Typical CSF Findings:**

| Test                  | Viral               | Bacterial                | Fungal/Tuberculous     |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Opening pressure       | Normal/slightly raised | Raised                   | Normal/raised           |
| Appearance             | Clear               | Cloudy/turbid/purulent   | Fibrin web              |
| WCC                    | Normal/slightly raised | Raised                   | Normal/slightly raised  |
| Predominant white cell | Lymphocytes         | Polymorphs              | Lymphocytes             |
| Protein                | Normal/slightly raised | Raised                   | Normal                  |
| Glucose                | Normal              | Decreased                | Normal/slightly decreased|

Management
-----------
- Start empirical antibiotics for suspected meningism.
- Prefer lumbar puncture before antibiotics; if not possible, administer antibiotics first.
- If investigations indicate viral cause, stop antibiotics.
- Herpes simplex meningitis: treat with acyclovir under specialist advice.
- Most cases: manage conservatively (bedrest, analgesia – paracetamol/ibuprofen).
- Clinically stable patients can be discharged home.
