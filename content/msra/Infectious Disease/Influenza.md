### Influenza Overview
- **Definition**: Highly infectious respiratory infection caused by Orthomyxoviridae viruses.
- **Transmission**: 
  - Droplet (respiratory secretions)
  - Contact with contaminated environments
  - Aerosol generating procedures (AGP) in healthcare settings.
- **Comparison with Common Cold**: 
  - Common cold is milder and caused by different viruses (e.g., RSV, rhinoviruses).
  - Influenza symptoms are more severe and have a shorter duration.

### Seasonal Patterns
- Peaks in winter (e.g., UK).
- Influenza can rapidly evolve (e.g., antigenic shift), complicating tracking and prevention.

### Types of Influenza
- **Types**: A, B, C, D
- **Human Impact**: Types A and B affect humans; Types C and D affect animals.
- **Pandemics**: Only Influenza A has caused pandemics (e.g., 1918 Spanish flu).

### Zoonotic Strains
- Rare strains can transmit from animals to humans (e.g., A(H5N1) from birds, A(H1N1) from pigs).

### Diagnosis
- **Incubation Period**: 1-3 days.
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Fever, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, fatigue, sore throat, dry cough.
  - Possible gastrointestinal (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting) or ocular symptoms (e.g., conjunctivitis).
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Aged >65 years
  - Children <2 years
  - Pregnant women
  - Chronic diseases (lungs, kidneys, liver, heart)
  - Immunocompromised individuals
  - Residents of long-term care facilities.

### Differential Diagnosis
- Other respiratory infections (e.g., COVID-19, bacterial pneumonia, RSV, parainfluenza).

### Investigations
- Clinical diagnosis sufficient during outbreaks.
- In complicated cases, consider:
  - Viral cultures
  - Immunofluorescent antibody staining
  - Serology
  - Enzyme immunoassay (EIA).
- Chest X-ray required for hospitalized patients; may show infiltrates in severe cases.
- Samples can be collected from sputum, nasopharynx, throat, and bronchial washings.

### Management of Emergencies
- **Red Flags**: 
  - Pneumonia
  - Hypoxia
  - Neurological signs
  - Exacerbation of comorbidities.
- **Treatment**: 
  - Oxygen therapy for hypoxia.
  - Hospital escalation if ward-level care is insufficient.

### General Management
- Most infections resolve without hospitalization.
- Supportive care: hydration, bedrest, analgesics (paracetamol, ibuprofen).
- Complicated cases require antiviral treatment (oseltamivir or zanamivir) within 48 hours.
- Antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections.

### Prevention
- **Vaccination**: Recommended annually for high-risk groups and healthcare workers.
- **Vaccine Types**: 
  - Inactivated (suitable for immunocompromised).
  - Live attenuated (nasal spray for children aged 2-17).
- Seasonal vaccines based on prevalent strains; monitored by WHO.

### Infection Control in Healthcare
- Measures include handwashing, personal protective equipment, cleaning, and patient cohorting.
