Lyme disease is a vector-borne disease caused by the bacteria _Borrelia burgdorferi_, transmitted by ticks. Transmission requires the tick to be attached for at least 36 hours. It has three stages: 

1. **Early Localised Infection**
   - Characterized by erythema migrans (a red rash) at the tick bite site, appearing about a week after the bite.

2. **Early Disseminated Infection**
   - Infection spreads through the lymphatic system or bloodstream.

3. **Late Disseminated Infection**
   - Occurs months later and can lead to chronic symptoms affecting multiple body parts.

### Diagnosis
- Common symptoms (80% of cases):
  - Red rash (erythema migrans)
  - Fever
  - Headache
  - Muscle and joint pain
  - Tiredness and malaise

- Chronic symptoms may include:
  - Joint swelling and pain
  - Neuralgia or peripheral neuropathy
  - Cardiac issues (e.g., carditis)
  - Encephalomyelitis

Diagnosis relies on symptoms and antibody testing if the rash is absent.

### Investigations
- Antibody detection:
  - IgM antibodies: 2-4 weeks post-infection
  - IgG antibodies: 4-6 weeks post-infection (peaks at 6-8 weeks)

- **Tests Considered:**
  - CSF and lymphocyte testing for neuroborreliosis; increased protein, normal glucose.
  - MRI for white matter lesions, enlarged ventricles, cortical atrophy.
  - Nerve conduction testing for peripheral nervous system involvement.
  - ECG/echocardiogram if myocardial dysfunction is suspected.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Early Localised Infection:**
  - 10-14 days of oral antibiotics (Doxycycline, Amoxicillin, Cefuroxime).
  - Cefuroxime/Amoxicillin for pregnant/breastfeeding women.
  
- **Advanced Cases:**
  - IV antibiotics for central nervous system involvement.
  - Pacemaker for one-third of Lyme carditis patients.
  - NSAIDs for pain and arthritis.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Chronic symptoms treated conservatively with physiotherapy and exercise to regain mobility.
- Cognitive recovery may take months to years.
- **Prevention:**
  - Avoid areas where deer ticks live; use insect repellent and protective clothing.
