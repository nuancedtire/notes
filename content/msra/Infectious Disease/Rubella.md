## Rubella Overview

- **Definition**: Infection caused by the togavirus family, also known as German measles.
- **Transmission**: Spread via respiratory secretions and airborne droplets.
- **Notifiable Disease**: Must be reported to Public Health in the UK.
- **Symptoms**: Most experience mild illness; recovery usually within a week. Special care required during pregnancy due to congenital rubella syndrome risk.

## Epidemiology

- **Current Status**: Rare in the UK due to MMR vaccine (given in two doses during the first and third year of life).
- **Endemic Regions**: Still common in developing countries.
- **Vaccine Considerations**: MMR is a live vaccine; not suitable for immunocompromised individuals.

## Historical Context

- **Autism Allegation**: A 1998 study suggested a link between MMR vaccine and autism; this was later discredited.
- **Public Impact**: Resulted in decreased vaccination rates for children during late 1990s and early 2000s.

## Diagnosis

- **Symptoms**:
  - Prodrome: Coryza and fever.
  - Rash: Maculopapular, starting behind the ears, spreading downwards (2-3 days after fever onset).
  - Other Signs: Lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis, petechiae of the palate (Forchheimer’s sign), arthritis/arthralgia in adults.
  
- **Infectivity**: 
  - Incubation: 14-21 days post-exposure.
  - Infective Period: 1 week before rash onset to 4 days after.

- **Complications**: Rare; include encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, Guillain-Barré syndrome. 

## Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS)

- **Risk**: 
  - Affects pregnant women exposed within 20 weeks of gestation.
  - Can lead to miscarriage or serious baby complications.

- **Complications**:
  - **Transient**: Hepatitis, rash, thrombocytopenia, anemia, lymphadenopathy.
  - **Permanent**: Cataracts, sensorineural deafness, patent ductus arteriosus, other diseases.
  - **Developmental**: Thyroid disease, progressive hearing/visual loss, insulin-dependent diabetes.

## Investigations

- **Primary Method**: Clinical diagnosis; confirmation via:
  - Blood tests for rubella-specific serum antibodies (IgM, IgG).
  - Viral PCR tests.

## Management

- **General Care**: Conservative; advised to rest, hydrate, and take paracetamol/ibuprofen as needed.
- **School/Work Exclusion**: Not allowed for 5 days after rash onset; avoid close contact with pregnant women.
- **Vaccination**: Non-immune pregnant mothers to receive the vaccine post-delivery; those in contact with suspected cases should consult specialists.
