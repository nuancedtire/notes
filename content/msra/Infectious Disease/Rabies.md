Rabies is a viral disease affecting humans and animals, primarily transmitted through dog bites. It has a high fatality rate (99-100%) once symptoms appear, usually developing 1-3 months post-infection but can occur more rapidly. Key prevention methods include vaccination and animal control.

### Diagnosis
**Forms of Rabies:**
1. **Furious Rabies**: 
   - Symptoms:
     - Hyperactivity
     - Hydrophobia (fear of water)
     - Aerophobia (fear of air)
     - Paranoia and terror
     - Hallucinations
     - Death due to cardio-respiratory arrest

2. **Paralytic Rabies**: 
   - Symptoms:
     - Paralysis
     - Delirium
     - Coma, potentially leading to death

**Clinical Challenges**: Diagnosis can be difficult without rabies-specific signs like hydrophobia. Symptoms may resemble encephalitis.

### Investigations
- **Fluorescent Antibody Test (FAT)**: Reference method for diagnosis, using immunohistochemistry to bind rabies-specific antibodies for visualization under fluorescent microscopy.

### Management (Prescribing)
**Post-Exposure Prophylaxis**: Immediate treatment post-bite to prevent virus CNS entry includes:
1. Wound washing (min. 15 minutes)
2. Immediate rabies vaccination
3. Rabies immunoglobulin if indicated

**WHO Contact Categories**:

| Category of Contact                      | Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Measures        |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 1 – Touching, but no exposure           | Washing only                             |
| 2 – Nibbling of uncovered skin          | Washing with immediate vaccination       |
| 3 – Transdermal bite                    | Washing, immediate vaccination and rabies immunoglobulin |

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
**Prevention**:
- Vaccination of dogs against rabies
- Supervise pets
- Avoid handling stray dogs
- Contact animal control if an animal displays unusual behavior
