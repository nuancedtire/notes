### Bilharzia (Schistosomiasis)

**Overview**
- Parasitic disease caused by *Schistosoma* trematodes (blood flukes).
- Transmitted by aquatic snails, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa.
- Infection generally occurs in childhood but may present later due to chronic disease.

### Diagnosis
**Risk Factors**
- **Occupational**: Fishing, irrigation, canal cleaning.
- **Non-occupational**: Swimming, washing.
- Travel to endemic regions (e.g., Africa, Middle East) increases risk.

**Stages of Disease**
1. **Initial Stage (Cercarial Dermatitis)**
   - Timeframe: Days-weeks
   - Features: Pruritus at entry sites ("swimmerâ€™s itch").

2. **Acute Stage**
   - Timeframe: Weeks-months
   - Features: Fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, facial edema, urticaria.

3. **Chronic Stage**
   - Timeframe: Up to 20 years
   - Features:
     - **Intestinal Schistosomiasis**: Abdominal pain, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly.
     - **Urogenital Schistosomiasis**: Hematuria, dysuria, genital lesions.

**Species Associated with Forms**
- *Intestinal Form*: 
  - *S. mansoni*: Africa, Middle East, South America, Caribbean.
  - *S. intercalatum/S. guineensis*: Central/west Africa.
  - *S. japonicum/S. mekongi*: Southeast/east Asia.
- *Urogenital Form*: 
  - *S. haematobium*: Africa, Middle East.

### Investigations
**Diagnostic Tests**
- **Stool/Urine Sample for Microscopy**: Visualizes/quantifies eggs, species identification.
  - Repeat tests for low-level disease; biopsy if needed.
  - In resource-limited settings: Urinary circulating anodic antigen test.

- **Urinalysis**: Checks for hematuria, leucocytes/nitrites.

**Blood Tests**
- Full blood count: Eosinophilia (acute), anemia.
- ELISA for antibodies.

**Imaging**
- Abdominal ultrasound.
- CT/MRI of abdomen.

### Emergencies Related to Schistosomiasis
- **Urinary System**: Bladder cancer (painless hematuria).
- **Gynaecological System**: Ectopic pregnancy (pain/bleeding).
- **Portal System**: Oesophageal varices (bleeding).
- **Intestinal System**: Bowel obstruction (pain/distension).
- **Central Nervous System**: Spinal cord compression (neurological symptoms).

### Management
**Pharmacological Management**
- First-line treatment: Praziquantel, 20 mg/kg.
  - *S. japonicum/S. mekongi*: 3 times daily for one day.
  - *S. mansoni/S. intercalatum/S. haematobium*: Twice daily for one day.
- Second round if symptomatic one month post-treatment.
- Adjunctive corticosteroids for symptomatic relief.

**Non-pharmacological Management**
- Interventional management for complications (e.g., bladder cancer treatment options like transurethral resection, radical cystectomy).
