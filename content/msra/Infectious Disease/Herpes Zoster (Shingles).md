Herpes zoster (shingles) is a painful blistering rash caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV). VZV remains latent in dorsal root ganglions following a chickenpox infection, commonly seen in childhood. Reactivation occurs later in life, leading to a dermatomal rash.

### Key Points

- **Cranial Nerve Involvement**: Can lead to complications like hearing loss (herpes zoster oticus) and vision loss (herpes zoster ophthalmicus).
- **Non-rash Variant**: Rare form is called herpes zoster sine herpete.
- **Risk Groups**: Older individuals, immunocompromised persons, and pregnant women are at higher risk for severe disease.

### Diagnosis

- Primarily clinical, based on rash presentation; may require PCR testing or MRI for uncertain cases.
- **Prodromal Symptoms**: Itching, tingling, or pain precede the rash.
- **Infectious Period**: Until lesions have crusted (typically 5-7 days after rash onset).

### Risk Factors

- Age
- Female sex
- Immunocompromise (e.g., HIV, chemotherapy)
- Emotional stress
- Concurrent infections
- Pregnancy

### Subtypes

1. **Herpes Zoster Oticus**
   - Affected area: Geniculate ganglion of facial nerve (CN VIII).
   - Features: Unilateral facial paralysis, vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus.

2. **Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus**
   - Affected area: Ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve (CN V).
   - Features: Photophobia, eye pain, lacrimation, vision loss, Hutchinsonâ€™s sign.

### Investigations

- Typically clinical; PCR testing from lesions or blood for VZV if needed.
- MRI for neurological symptoms; HIV testing for frequent infections.

### Complications

- Pneumonia
- Encephalitis
- Secondary bacterial infections
- Post-herpetic neuralgia
- Permanent vision or hearing loss
- Facial paralysis
- Myelitis

### Management

#### Pregnant Women

- If exposed to VZV, check for antibodies.
- Negative results: Administer varicella-zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) within 10 days.
- Oral aciclovir post 20 weeks gestation; IV aciclovir for severe cases.

#### Foetal Varicella Syndrome (FVS)
- Risks to unborn if varicella developed during pregnancy.
- Features: Eye defects, limb hypoplasia, neurological defects.

#### Antiviral Treatment
- Start within 72 hours of symptoms.
- Typical regimen: Aciclovir 800mg orally five times daily for 7-10 days.
- Options: IV aciclovir, valaciclovir, famciclovir.
- Treatment may still be effective beyond 72 hours for high-risk individuals.

#### Symptomatic Treatment
- Corticosteroids (for ophthalmicus)
- Analgesics (amitriptyline for neuropathic pain)
- Artificial tears
- Surgery for ocular complications

### Non-Prescribing Management
- Maintain hygiene and cleanliness of rash.
- Avoid contact with unexposed individuals, pregnant women, newborns, and immunocompromised persons.

### Prevention
- Vaccination is available for ages 70-79 in the UK.
- Options: Zostavax (live, single dose) or Shingrix (recombinant, two doses).
