Malaria Overview
- **Cause**: Parasitic disease by protozoan _Plasmodium_ species
- **Transmission**: Female _Anopheles_ mosquito
- **Common Species**: _P. falciparum_ and _P. vivax_; _P. falciparum_ leads in morbidity/mortality
- **Geographical Prevalence**: Mostly in Africa and Asia; UK cases often linked to travel history

### Diagnosis
- **Risk Factors**: Travel to affected regions, insufficient protection (e.g., chemoprophylaxis, insecticide-treated nets)
- **Non-Modifiable Risks for Severe Disease**: 
  - Extremes of age
  - Immunocompromised status
  - Low immunity due to lack of prior exposure
  
- **Symptoms**:
  - Fever (may occur in patterns, e.g., every 2-3 days)
  - Rigors
  - Sweats
  - Headache
  - Myalgia/arthralgia
  - Hepatosplenomegaly (initially uncommon)

- **Suspicious Signs for Falciparum Disease**:
  - Seizures/impaired consciousness
  - Jaundice
  - Hypotension
  - Oliguria

### Investigations
- **Diagnostic Tests**:
  - **Thick and Thin Blood Smears** (Giemsa stained)
    - Thick: Detects parasites
    - Thin: Identifies species and parasitaemia level
  - **Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs)**: In resource-limited settings

- **Further Tests**:
  - **Urinalysis**: Look for haemoglobinuria/proteinuria (in falciparum)
  - **Blood Tests**:
    - Full Blood Count (FBC): Thrombocytopaenia, anaemia
    - Urea and Electrolytes (U&Es): Low sodium, renal failure (severe cases)
    - Liver Function Tests (LFTs): Hyperbilirubinemia (unconjugated), raised aminotransferases
    - Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): For inconclusive microscopy
  - **Imaging**: CT of head for seizures/impaired consciousness (suspected falciparum)

### Emergency Management
- Malaria is a medical emergency.
- Consult infectious disease specialist urgently.
- Admittance to hospital for high-risk patients (e.g., suspected falciparum disease, extremes of age, pregnancy).

### Common Complication
- **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: Due to hypovolemia or acute tubular necrosis; requires fluid replacement and renal support.

### Treatment Guidelines
- **P. falciparum Management (whether known or suspected)**:
  - **Uncomplicated**: 
    - Artemisinin combination therapy (e.g., artemether-lumefantrine)
      - **Pregnancy**: 2nd/3rd trimesters only
    - If unavailable: Quinine with doxycycline (Quinine + clindamycin for all trimesters of pregnancy)

  - **Complicated/Severe**: 
    - IV artesunate (for all trimesters) or alternative IV quinine with clindamycin

- **Non-falciparum Management**:
  - **Uncomplicated**:
    - Artemisinin combination therapy or chloroquine (with primaquine for P. vivax or P. ovale).
    - **Pregnancy Considerations**: Chloroquine safe for all trimesters; primaquine should only start post-pregnancy/breastfeeding.
      - G6PD deficiency screening before primaquine.
  
  - **Complicated/Severe**: Same as severe falciparum disease management.

### Summary of Therapies
- **Uncomplicated Disease**:
  - **Artemisinin combination therapy**
  - First trimester: 
    - Quinine + clindamycin (falciparum)
    - Chloroquine (non-falciparum)
- **Severe Disease**: 
  - **IV artesunate**

### Reporting
- All cases must be reported to Public Health England.
- Manage severe disease in high-dependency/intensive care unit settings if needed.
