Yellow fever is a viral hemorrhagic disease characterized by a short duration (3-4 days) with onset typically occurring 3-6 days post-exposure. The disease gets its name from jaundice, which affects some patients. It is transmitted through mosquito bites and is not contagious through human contact. 

**Pathophysiology:**
- Virus replicates in lymph nodes and infects dendritic cells, leading to liver failure via hepatocytes.

**Geographical Prevalence:**
- Commonly found in Sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America, and the Caribbean.
- A single-dose vaccine is highly effective in preventing the disease.

### Diagnosis
- **Asymptomatic** in many cases.
- **Symptoms:** 
  - Fever
  - Headache
  - Nausea
  - Muscle pain and backache
  - Loss of appetite
- Symptoms last 3-4 days; 15% may progress to a toxic phase with:
  - Recurring fever
  - Jaundice due to liver failure
  - Abdominal pain
  - Bleeding (mouth, nose, eyes, GI tract)
- Jaundice carries a 20-50% mortality rate.
- Diagnosis requires clinical symptoms and travel history; early diagnosis is challenging due to overlap with other diseases (malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis).

### Investigations
- **Early Detection:** PCR testing in blood and urine.
- **Later Stages:** Antibody testing is necessary.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Prevention:** Vaccination recommended for travelers to at-risk countries, at least 10 days prior to travel.
- Post-MMR vaccination requires a 4-week waiting period before receiving the yellow fever vaccine.
- **Vaccine Availability:** Not provided by NHS.
- **Exclusions from Vaccination:**
  - Infants <9 months
  - Pregnant women
  - Immunocompromised individuals
  - Severe egg protein allergies
- **Treatment:** No cure; supportive care only (rehydration therapy, analgesia).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
**Vector Control Recommendations:**
1. Use DEET insect repellents.
2. Wear long-sleeved clothing; consider permethrin-treated clothing.
3. Utilize mosquito nets.
4. Stay indoors from dusk to dawn in air-conditioned rooms.
5. Apply larvicides to eliminate mosquito breeding sites in water containers.
