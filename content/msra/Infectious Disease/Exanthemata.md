An **exanthem** is a widespread rash that appears suddenly, affecting multiple skin areas simultaneously. It primarily occurs in children and is typically accompanied by fever, malaise, and headache. Causes of exanthems include toxins, drugs, microorganisms (mostly viruses), or autoimmune reactions. The six common childhood exanthematous infections are:

1. **Measles** (measles virus)
2. **Scarlet fever** (_Streptococcus pyogenes_)
3. **Rubella** (rubella virus)
4. **Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome** (_Staphylococcus aureus_)
5. **Erythema infectiosum** (parvovirus B19)
6. **Roseola infantum** (HHV-6 and HHV-7)

### Diagnosis

**Measles:**
- **Features:**
  - Prodrome: cough, coryza, conjunctivitis
  - Koplik spots appear before rash
  - Rash: starts behind ears, spreads body
- **Complications:**
  - Otitis media (most common)
  - Pneumonia (leading cause of death)

**Scarlet Fever:**
- **Features:**
  - Fever lasting 24-48 hours, followed by headache and tonsillitis
  - Strawberry tongue
  - Rash: fine punctate erythema, 'boiled lobster appearance', rough sandpaper feel
- **Complications:**
  - Otitis media (most common)

**Rubella:**
- **Features:**
  - Low-grade fever prodrome
  - Lymphadenopathy (suboccipital and postauricular)
  - Rash: maculopapular, starts on face, spreads body
- **Complications:**
  - Congenital rubella syndrome if contracted during pregnancy

**Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome:**
- **Features:**
  - Fever and malaise in infants
  - Localized infection around eyes, nose, mouth; progresses to widespread erythema and blistering
  - Positive Nikolskyâ€™s sign
  
**Erythema Infectiosum:**
- **Features:**
  - Asymptomatic or mild fever
  - Rash in 3 phases: 
    - Slapped cheek (4 days)
    - Raised net/lace appearance (6-14 days)
    - Recurrent phase (2-3 weeks)
- **Complications:**
  - Fetal infection (hydrops fetalis)
  - Aplastic crisis in sickle-cell disease patients

**Roseola Infantum:**
- **Features:**
  - High fever for 3-4 days
  - Rash: maculopapular, starts on neck and trunk, spreads to face/extremities
  - Nagayama spots on uvula and soft palate
- **Complications:**
  - Febrile convulsions in 10-15% of children

### Investigations
- Clinical diagnosis is often possible; further investigations may include:
  - Viral swab for culture, immunofluorescence, PCR
  - Blood tests for serology
  - ASO/anti-DNAse B titres for scarlet fever
  - Genotyping

### Management (Prescribing)
Treatment is based on the cause:
1. **Measles:** Supportive care, ibuprofen or paracetamol for fever; avoid aspirin (Reye syndrome risk)
2. **Scarlet Fever:** Oral penicillin for 10 days; erythromycin if allergic
3. **Rubella:** No specific treatment; manage congenital rubella syndrome surgically
4. **Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome:** IV flucloxacillin and analgesia
5. **Erythema Infectiosum:** Supportive care, antipyretics
6. **Roseola Infantum:** Supportive care; antiepileptics not recommended for febrile convulsions

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Most children recover without specific treatment.
- **Supportive measures:**
  - Moisturising emollients for rash
  - Monitor fluid balance in staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (risk of sepsis)
