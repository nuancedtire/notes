## Measles Overview

- **Cause**: Measles virus (paramyxovirus family)
- **Transmission**: Highly infectious; spread via droplets (coughing/sneezing) and contaminated surfaces.
- **Notification**: Notifiable disease in the UK; all cases reported to Public Health.

## Vaccination

- **Vaccine**: Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine
- **Schedule**: Two doses; administered in the first and third year of life.
- **Contraindication**: Not suitable for immunocompromised individuals.
- **Public Concerns**: Association between MMR vaccine and autism (1998 paper) was disproven but affected vaccination rates, particularly in the late 1990s to early 2000s.

## Recent Trends

- **Decline**: Decreased vaccine uptake leading to outbreaks, especially in university populations.
- **Public Health Initiatives**: Campaigns to encourage vaccination.

## Diagnosis

- **Method**: Primarily clinical diagnosis.
- **Incubation Period**: 7 to 18 days.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Initial prodrome: fever, coryza (3-4 days)
  - Rash: widespread erythematous maculopapular rash (cranio-caudal spread); initially blanching, may become non-blanching.
  - Other features: non-productive cough, conjunctivitis, Koplikâ€™s spots (pathognomonic).

- **Infectious Period**: From symptom onset to 4 days after rash appearance.

## Complications

- **Common Complications**:
  - Pulmonary measles (pneumonia)
  - Otitis media
  - Encephalitis
  - Febrile convulsions in children
  - Miscarriage/stillbirth in non-immune pregnant women

- **Risk Factors**: Immunocompromised, pregnancy, children under 1 year old.

## Differential Diagnosis

- **Rashes**:
  - Parvovirus B19: 'slapped cheek' appearance
  - Rubella: Diffuse rash, may have postauricular lymphadenopathy
  - Kawasaki disease: Central distribution rash, rarely affects the face
  - Roseola infantum: Rash appears as symptoms resolve (3-5 days)
  - Bacterial meningitis: Non-blanching rash; assess for photophobia, nausea, vomiting
  - Scarlet fever: Maculopapular rash from abdomen, may have exudative tonsillitis

## Investigations

- **Serology**: 
  - IgM: Indicates acute infection
  - IgG: Indicates past infection or vaccination
- **PCR**: Polymerase chain reaction for diagnosis

## Management

- **Treatment**: Conservative; rest, fluids, paracetamol/ibuprofen for symptoms.
- **School/Work Exclusion**: Avoid for 4 days post-rash onset.
- **Consultation**: Contact local Health Protection Team if suspected case involves:
  - Immunosuppressed individuals
  - Pregnant women
  - Children under 1 year

- **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis**: 
  - Vaccine if within 72 hours of exposure.
  - Intramuscular immunoglobulin for pregnant women in contact with measles.
