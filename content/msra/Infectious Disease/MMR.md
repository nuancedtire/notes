- **Field**: Neuro-paediatrics
  - Highly specialized, includes rare diseases.
  - SSPE (Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis) is one such disease.

- **Common Reasons for Neurology Referral**:
  - Behavioral change
  - Seizures
  - Causes may include:
    - Brain injuries
    - Intracranial infections
    - Brain tumors
    - Developmental disorders
    - Genetic disorders
    - Behavioral issues
    - Psychiatric problems

- **Measles**: 
  - Dangerous illness with serious complications:
    - Meningitis
    - Encephalitis
    - Hepatitis
    - Optic neuritis
    - Pneumonia
  - SSPE is a rare complication:
    - Chronic brain inflammation
    - Progressive neurological disorder
    - Latency: several months to 10 years post measles infection
    - Fatal within a few years of diagnosis.

- **Symptoms**:
  - Initial: Behavioral changes
  - Progression: Focal neurology (muscle spasms, seizures, spasticity, visual loss)
  - End stage: Dementia, autonomic disturbances, coma, and death.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Based on clinical suspicion.
  - Confirmed by:
    - Viral PCR of CSF (shows measles infection).
  - Neuro-imaging (CT, MRI) to exclude other causes.
  - EEG as part of the work-up.

- **Treatment**:
  - Terminal disease, no cure available.
  - Supportive care includes:
    - Antiepileptic medications for seizures.
    - Antispasmodics for spasticity.
    - Extensive nursing care as disease progresses.
  - Prevention via measles vaccination is the only effective treatment.
