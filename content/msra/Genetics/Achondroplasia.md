### Achondroplasia Overview
- **Definition**: Genetic condition from a gain of function mutation in the _FGFR3_ gene.
- **Effects**: Disproportionate short stature; average adult height is 4 feet.
- **Inheritance**: Autosomal dominant; 50% chance of passing to offspring; 80% arise from spontaneous mutations.
- **Incidence**: ~1 in 20,000 live births.

### Diagnosis
- **Prenatal**: Detected via routine ultrasound, especially in the 3rd trimester.
  - **Signs on Ultrasound**:
    - Short hands with wide fingers
    - Narrow trunk
    - Shortened proximal long bones (rhizomelic shortening)
    - Head deformities: large head, frontal bossing, hypoplastic midface
- **Postnatal**: Signs may include:
  - Hip abduction when lying flat
  - Mild hypotonia (spinal cord compression)
  - Hypermobility (except in elbows)

**Motor Development**: 
- Head up by 7 months
- Crawl by 10 months
- Sit unsupported by 11 months
- Walk unaided by 22 months

### Investigations
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Possible via physical exam or ultrasound findings.
- **DNA Testing**: May be needed for confirmation; focuses on classical 1138 mutation; can differentiate from hypochondroplasia.
- **Skeletal Survey**: Key for suspicion of achondroplasia; X-ray findings include:
  - Increased space between vertebrae pedicles
  - Shortened proximal long bones
  - Metaphyseal changes
  - Brachydactyly
  - ‘Trident’ finger appearance
  - Abnormal skull features (larger cranium, decreased foramen magnum).

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Growth Hormone Trials**: Limited success in achieving long-term height increase.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Complication Management**:
  - Hydrocephalus
  - Compression at foramen magnum
  - Sleep apnea (early spinal cord compression; may need ENT for tonsil/adenoid removal)
  - Tibial bowing (osteotomies to prevent osteoarthritis)
  - Repeated otitis media (ENT referral)
  - Hearing loss
  - Obesity (lifestyle modifications).

- **Therapies**:
  - Physiotherapy for motor delay
  - Occupational therapy for daily adaptations.

- **Surgical Options**: Limb lengthening surgeries (increase height by 15-30 cm) involve risks (poor healing, nerve/blood vessel damage).

- **Delivery Considerations**: Caesarean sections may be advised if detected prenatally due to head size concerns.
