Haemochromatosis is an **autosomal recessive** condition involving excessive iron levels in the body, primarily deposited in the **liver**, **heart**, **pancreas**, and **endocrine glands**. Total body iron can reach **20-60g** (normal: **4g**). Types include **primary (hereditary)** and **secondary** (e.g., from blood transfusion, thalassaemia, liver disease).

### Diagnosis
**Clinical Features:**
- Fatigue
- Arthralgia
- Lethargy
- Pigmentation (groin, axillae - bronzing to grey)
- Loss of libido
- Asymptomatic patients possible

**Complications:** 
- Liver disease
- Heart failure, arrhythmias
- Diabetes mellitus
- Rarely, hepatocellular carcinoma

**Risk Factors:**
- Male
- Caucasian ancestry
- Family history
- Middle-aged

### Investigations
1. **Serum transferrin saturation:** Elevated indicates possible haemochromatosis.
2. **Ferritin levels:** Higher levels indicate greater iron overload.
   
   | Severity of Iron Overload | Ferritin Level (picomols/L) |
   | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
   | Mild                      | <1125                       |
   | Moderate                  | 1125-2250                   |
   | Severe                    | >2250                       |

**Note:** Ferritin can be raised due to inflammation, infection, malignancy.

**Organ Damage Assessment:**
- **Liver:** MRI, liver biopsy, LFTs
- **Pancreas:** Fasting blood sugar
- **Heart:** ECG, echocardiogram
- **Sex Hormones:** Testosterone, FSH, LH levels (hypogonadism)
- **DEXA Scan:** If osteoporosis risk factors present

### Management
#### Prescribing
- **Phlebotomy** preferred. If contraindicated (e.g., anemia, poor venous access), use **iron chelation therapy**.

#### Non-Prescribing
**Stages of Haemochromatosis Management:**

| Stage | C282Y Homozygosity | Transferrin Saturation | Serum Ferritin | Clinical Symptoms | Management |
|-------|---------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| 0     | Yes                 | Normal                | Normal          | None             | Monitor 3-yearly |
| 1     | Yes                 | Increased             | Normal          | None             | Monitor yearly |
| 2     | Yes                 | Increased             | Increased       | None             | Phlebotomy or iron chelation |
| 3     | Yes                 | Increased             | Increased       | Affects QoL      | Phlebotomy |
| 4     | Yes                 | Increased             | Increased       | Organ damage risk | Phlebotomy, urgent care |

**Phlebotomy Protocol:**
- Initially weekly until serum ferritin <112 picomols/L.
- Once target reached, reduce frequency.

**Recommendations:**
- Avoid iron supplements and iron-rich foods (e.g., fortified cereals).
- Avoid Vitamin C (increases iron absorption).
- Limit alcohol intake.
- Vaccinate against Hepatitis A and B.
