Patau syndrome (trisomy 13) is a genetic disorder where chromosome 13 is present three times in cells. It occurs more frequently in females (1 in 5,000-12,000 live births) and is associated with a 1% miscarriage rate and increased pre-eclampsia rates. Survival rates are low, with 50% of infants dying within the first week and 90% by the end of infancy.

### Causes
- Primarily due to **de novo errors** during meiosis.
- **Advanced parental age** is the main risk factor.
- Approximately **20%** of cases result from translocation involving chromosome 13.
- **Mosaicism** occurs in around **5%** of cases, where only some cells have the extra chromosome, leading to less severe symptoms.

### Diagnosis
Common features present at birth may include:
- Facial clefting
- Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
- Holoprosencephaly (may include cyclopia)
- Microcephaly
- Polydactyly
- Rocker-bottom feet
- Neural tube defects
- Heart defects (ASD, VSD, PDA)
- Renal defects
- Omphalocoele
- Cutis aplasia
- Cryptorchidism

### Investigations
- **Screening**: Blood tests and ultrasounds at 10-14 weeks of pregnancy.
  - Ultrasound may show holoprosencephaly, polydactyly, and growth retardation.
- **Diagnostic tests**: Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling for high-risk screenings.
- **Postnatal diagnosis**: Clinical examination, identification of physical features, and DNA analysis. Trisomy 13 infants may have persistent fetal hemoglobin.

### Management (non-prescribing)
- Treatment is **supportive**, based on individual symptoms.
- Surgical correction may be needed for conditions like cleft lip/palate or heart defects.
- Involves a **multidisciplinary team** for comprehensive care.
- Support services (social services, physiotherapy, genetic counseling) benefit families.
