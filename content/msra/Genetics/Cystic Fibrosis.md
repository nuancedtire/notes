## Cystic Fibrosis Overview

- **Nature**: Autosomal recessive, multisystem disorder.
- **Cause**: Mutation in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CTFR) chloride channel.
- **Effects**: Impaired ion transport, increased secretion in airways, decreased immune function, vulnerability to chronic infections (e.g., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus).
- **Systems affected**:
  - **Airways**: Impaired ciliary function, increased mucus production.
  - **Intestines**: Risk of meconium ileus (10-20% in infants).
  - **Pancreas**: Pancreatic duct blockage, leading to insufficiency (90% of children).
  - **Sweat glands**: Excessive sodium and chloride secretion.
- **Common Mutation**: ΔF508; CTFR gene on chromosome 7.
- **Life Expectancy**: Around 40 years.

## Diagnosis

- **Initial Screening**: Heel-prick blood test (5-8 days after birth) - checks for raised immunoreactive trypsinogen.
- **Confirmatory Tests**:
  - Genetic screening for common CTFR mutations.
  - Sweat test: 
    - Normal chloride concentration: 10-40 mmol/L.
    - Cystic Fibrosis diagnosis: 60-125 mmol/L.
- **Clinical Symptoms**: Failure to thrive, malabsorption, recurrent chest infections, bronchiectasis, nasal polyps, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, pneumothorax, and male infertility.

## Investigations

### New Diagnosis

- Heel-prick test for immunoreactive trypsinogen and CTFR gene mutations.
- Sweat test for chloride concentration.

### Annual Review

- Weight and height assessment.
- Physiotherapy evaluation.
- Oxygen saturation measurement.
- Chest X-ray.
- Blood tests: white cell count, aspergillus serology, serum IGE.
- Microbiology of respiratory secretions.
- Lung function testing (FEV1, FVC, FEF 25-75%).

## Emergency Management

- **Symptomatic Exacerbation**: Fevers, productive cough, dyspnea.
- **Investigations**: 
  - Chest X-ray, blood cultures, sputum cultures, ABG, blood tests (FBC, U&E, LFTs, CRP).
- **Management**:
  - Broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (narrow-spectrum if causative organism found).
  - Oxygen therapy if sat low.
  - Nebulized salbutamol for wheezing.
  - Fluids as needed.
  - Consider ITU referral if in respiratory failure.

- **Pneumothorax Management**:
  - **Small**: Observation or aspiration.
  - **Large**: Chest drain.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Antibiotics**: Prophylactic oral antibiotics (flucloxacillin); different course for respiratory symptom decline.
- **IV Antibiotics**: Some may need PIC line for frequent exacerbations.
- **Symptomatic Relief**: Dornase alfa to ease sputum clearance.
- **Diabetes Management**: Insulin and endocrinologist care.
- **New Drug**: Lumacaftor-Ivacaftor (short-term pulmonary function benefit, not recommended by NICE).

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Multidisciplinary Approach**:
  - Chest physiotherapy: At least twice daily.
  - High-calorie diet: 150% of daily requirement; may require gastrostomy for feeding.
  - Enzyme replacement therapy for pancreatic insufficiency.
  - Psychological and emotional support for patients and families.
  - Regular exercise: Beneficial for lung function and fitness.
  - **End-stage Care**: Bilateral lung transplant with 50% survival at 10 years.
