- **Condition**: Fragile X Syndrome
  - **Genetic Type**: X-linked dominant
  - **Causes**: Mutation in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome
  - **Protein**: FMRP (involved in synapse development)

- **Prevalence**:
  - Affects more males than females (1 in 4000 males, 1 in 8000 females)
  - Majority of affected males have intellectual disabilities; ~1/3 females do
  - Seizures: ~15% of males, ~5% of females
  
- **Associated Conditions**:
  - ADHD
  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
  - Anxiety
  
- **Physical Features**:
  - Prominent ears
  - Macrocephaly
  - Long face
  - Large testes (post-puberty)
  - Excessive shyness in females

### **Diagnosis**:
- **Method**: DNA analysis
  - Trinucleotide repeat expansion in FMR1 gene
    - **Normal**: Up to 45 repeats
    - **Premutation**: 55-200 repeats (can be passed to daughters)
    - **Full Mutation**: >200 repeats (likely leads to intellectual disability)
- **Prenatal Testing**: Possible via amniocentesis if mother is a known carrier

### **Investigations**:
- Primary investigation: Genetic testing
- Additional investigations may occur for associated conditions (such as ASD and ADHD)

### **Management**:
- **Medications**: No specific medications for Fragile X; ADHD symptoms may be treated with methylphenidate
- **Non-prescribing Management**: Intellectual support to encourage independence
