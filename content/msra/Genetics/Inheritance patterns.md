## Sickle Cell Anaemia Overview

- **Cause**: Single base mutation; glutamine replaced by valine at position 6 in beta-globin chain (HbS vs HbA).
- **Inheritance**: Autosomal recessive
  - Offspring can have:
    - Unaffected (AA)
    - Heterozygous (AS - trait) – intermediate symptoms
    - Homozygous (SS) – most severe symptoms

### Prevalence
- Heterozygous trait common in Africa (malaria protection).
- About 10% of the Afro-Caribbean population in the UK are carriers.
- Homozygous condition manifests around 6 months of life.

### Pathophysiology
- HbSS red blood cells become rigid and sickle due to polymerisation triggered by:
  - Hypoxia
  - Cold
  - Dehydration
  - Acidosis
- Resulting complications include:
  - Reduced cell lifespan
  - Microcirculation obstruction
  - Ischaemia

## Diagnosis

### Symptoms
- Frequent hospital admissions due to:
  - Severe bone pain
  - Pulmonary hypertension (30-40% prevalence)
  - Anaemia (Hb levels ~60-80)
  - Avascular necrosis
  - Increased infections (lungs/kidneys)
  - Leg ulcers
  - Cardiac issues
  - Neurological abnormalities (25%)
  - Pigmented [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|gallstones]]
  - Chronic hepatomegaly
  - Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis
  - Retinopathies
  - Atrophic spleen (increased sepsis risk)
  - Osteomyelitis due to salmonella

### Investigations
- **Newborn Screening**: Heel-prick test
- **Confirmation**: Haemoglobin electrophoresis (if positive)
- **Older Children/Adults**: Family history, anaemic signs, sickled red blood cells on film.

## Emergency Management

### Types of Acute Crises
1. **Thrombotic/Vaso-occlusive**: Painful; caused by dehydration, infection, or hypoxia; affects organs (brain, spleen, lungs, bones).
2. **Aplastic**: Sudden drop in haemoglobin due to parvovirus infection.
3. **Haemolytic**: Rare; increased haemolysis reduces haemoglobin.
4. **Acute Chest Syndrome**: Common cause of death; presents with [[chest pain]], low oxygen saturation, dyspnoea, pulmonary infiltrates.
5. **Sequestration**: Sickle cells pool in organs (lungs/spleen); can lead to circulatory collapse.

### Treatment During Crises
- **Key Interventions**:
  - Analgesia
  - Oxygen
  - Blood transfusion
  - Rehydration
  - Antibiotics (if infection evident)

## Long-term Management (Non-prescribing)

- **Hydroxyurea**: Increases foetal haemoglobin, used prophylactically to manage disease.
- **Vaccinations**: Every 5 years for pneumococcal, annual flu, and childhood vaccines recommended by NICE.
