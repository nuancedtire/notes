**Huntington’s Disease Overview**

- Also known as Huntington's chorea
- Hereditary neurodegenerative disorder
- Causes death of brain cells in basal ganglia and cortex
- Progressive and incurable, typically fatal within 20 years of symptom onset
- Most common death causes: intercurrent illness (pneumonia), suicide

**Genetic Factors**

- **Inheritance**: Autosomal dominant
- **Mechanism**: Trinucleotide repeat disorder (CAG repeat in the huntingtin gene - HTT on chromosome 4p16.3)
- **Anticipation**: Earlier onset in successive generations
- **Neurodegeneration**: Affects cholinergic and GABAergic neurons in the striatum (caudate nucleus of basal ganglia)

**Diagnosis**

- **Prevalence**: 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 20,000
- **Common Inheritance**: Most common inherited neurodegenerative disorder and genetic cause of chorea
- **Age of Onset**: Typically 30-50 years, but can occur earlier (juvenile Huntington’s disease - JHD)
- **JHD Characteristics**: Early symptoms include learning difficulties, behavioral disturbances, Parkinsonian features, dystonia, dementia, epilepsy; chorea may be mild or absent.

**Clinical Features**

- **Triad**: Motor, cognitive, psychiatric symptoms
- **Distinct Features**:
  - Chorea
  - Dystonia (saccadic eye movements)
  - Incoordination
  - Cognitive impairment
  - Behavioral changes (irritability, apathy, depression, dysphoria, OCD, agitation, anxiety, poor self-care, poor judgement, inflexibility)

- **Depression is prevalent** in HTT gene carriers.

**Stages of Disease Presentation**

1. **Prodromal Phase**: Mild psychotic and behavioral symptoms.
2. **Early Features**: Personality changes, self-neglect, apathy, clumsiness, facial grimaces evolve.
3. **Disease Progression**: Chorea, rigidity, dementia, seizures, increasing depression/aggression.
4. **Later Stage**: Dystonia replaces chorea, Parkinsonian features, spasticity, clonus, extensor plantar responses; potential cardiomyopathy and skeletal muscle wasting.

**Investigations**

- **Imaging**: MRI/CT scans may show loss of striatal volume and enlarged frontal horns of lateral ventricles in moderate-to-severe cases.
- **Genetic Testing**: Requires extensive counselling; confirms mutation but not onset timing.
- **Exclude Other Conditions**: Tests for thyroid disease, SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome, Wilson’s disease.

**Management**

**Pharmacological Treatments**:
- **Chorea**: Benzodiazepines, sodium valproate, dopamine-depleting agents, neuroleptics.
- **Bradykinesia/Rigidity**: Levodopa, dopamine agonists.
- **Depression**: SSRIs first-line; ECT for refractory cases.
- **Psychosis**: Atypical antipsychotics preferred.

**Non-Pharmacological Management**:
- **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Neurology, general practice, psychiatry, clinical genetics, etc.
- **Therapist Support**: Speech and language therapy, physiotherapy for balance/movement, occupational therapy for daily tasks.
- **Psychotherapy**: For OCD and irritability; consider antipsychotics if ineffective.
- **Deep Brain Stimulation**: For palliative treatment of dystonia, stiffness, chorea.
