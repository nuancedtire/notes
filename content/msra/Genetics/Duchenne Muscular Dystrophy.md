### Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)

- **Overview**:  
  - X-linked degenerative disease.
  - Caused by mutation in dystrophin gene on the X chromosome.
  - Most common and rapidly progressive muscular dystrophy.
  - Affects approximately 1 in 3000-3500 live births in the UK.
  - 50% chance sons inherit the mutation; 50% chance daughters become carriers.

### Diagnosis

- **Symptoms** (typically appear by age 3):
  - Delay in motor development.
  - Waddling gait.
  - Calf hypertrophy.
  - Gower’s sign (proximal hip weakness).
  - Reduced muscle tone and reflexes.

- **Diagnostic Tests**:
  - **Blood Test**: Elevated Creatinine Kinase (CK) levels.
  - **Confirmatory Tests**: Muscle biopsy and genetic testing.

- **Prognosis**:
  - Progressive disorder with life expectancy around 30 years.
  - Causes of death: cardiomyopathy, respiratory failure.
  - Loss of ability to walk by ages 10-14; wheelchair dependence.
  - Associated conditions: scoliosis (majority) and learning difficulties (1/3).

### Investigations

- **First Investigation**: Serum CK Test.
  - CK levels in DMD: 50-100 times the normal value.
  
- **Genetic Testing**: 
  - Detect mutations in the X chromosome Xp21 region.
  - If mutation not found, test mother and siblings.
  - If no mutation found or testing is not possible, perform muscle biopsy.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Corticosteroids**: For ambulant children to maintain mobility, but with significant side effects (weight gain, osteoporosis, delayed growth/puberty).
  
- **Ataluren**: Recommended for children over 5 with a nonsense mutation in the dystrophin gene (approximately 15% of DMD cases) to delay loss of walking ability and improve quality of life.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Physiotherapy**: Crucial for muscle strengthening and preventing contractures.
  
- **Surgical Intervention**: May be necessary for scoliosis.
  
- **Ventilatory Support**: As DMD progresses, may require CPAP or non-invasive ventilation.
  
- **Nutritional Support**: Feeding assistance if swallowing ability declines.

- **Psychological Support**: For the affected child and family.
