Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic disorder occurring in males with an extra X chromosome, commonly causing primary hypogonadism. Untreated, it may lead to delayed puberty, infertility, and osteoporosis.

### Karyotype
- **Most common**: 47,XXY (majority)
- **Mosaicism**: 47,XXY/46XY (10%), leading to milder symptoms
- **Rare forms**: More than three X chromosomes can cause more severe symptoms.

### Diagnosis
- **Awareness**: Many are undiagnosed due to a spectrum of symptoms.
- **Clinical findings**: Subtle in pre-pubertal or mosaic patients; severe karyotypes easier to diagnose.
- **Common symptoms**: 
  - Small testes (<5ml), infertility often diagnosed in adulthood.
  - Neonatal signs: micropenis, hypospadias, cryptorchidism.
  - Symptoms of incomplete pubertal development: 
    - Small testes
    - Decreased facial and pubic hair
    - Abdominal fat
    - Gynecomastia
    - Tall stature

### Additional Issues
- **Hypotonia and coordination problems**
- **Learning disabilities and speech delays**
- **Complications from untreated hypogonadism**:
  - Metabolic syndrome
  - Cardiovascular disease
  - Thromboembolic disease
  - Increased tremors
  - Breast cancer
  - Osteoporosis
  - Autoimmune disorders
- **Psychological issues**: Anxiety, depression, poor social skills, emotional immaturity, impulsivity.

### Investigations
- **Hormone testing**: 
  - Post-pubertal: hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (high LH, FSH; low testosterone)
  - Prepubescent: normal LH, FSH, testosterone.
- **Specialist tests**:
  - Chromosome analysis (definitive if abnormal gonadotropin levels).
  - Semen analysis for infertility or hypogonadism.
- **Further tests** for diabetes, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis after diagnosis.

### Management
#### **Prescribing**
- **Testosterone replacement therapy**: for symptoms of androgen deficiency in pubertal boys and adults; restores normal testosterone levels, does not improve infertility but can enhance mood, libido, and muscle mass.

#### **Non-prescribing**
- **Goal**: Symptom control and prevention/treatment of associated conditions.
- **Multidisciplinary team support**:
  - Speech and language therapy 
  - Occupational therapy 
  - Physiotherapy 
  - Infertility specialists 
  - Psychological support and counselling 
  - Behavioural therapy 
  - Endocrinologists
- **Gynecomastia treatment**: Reduction mammoplasty if severe, ideally after testosterone therapy initiation.
- **Infertility options**: 
  - Approximately 50% can undergo microTESE for assisted reproductive techniques.
  - Other options: adoption, artificial insemination. 
  - Sperm cryopreservation suggested for peripubertal boys.
