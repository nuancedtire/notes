- **Definition**: Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a genetic condition characterized by excessively high cholesterol levels.

- **Cholesterol Levels**: 
  - Total cholesterol levels > 7.5 mmol/L are suspicious for FH (NICE).
  - High levels are rarely due to lifestyle factors alone.

- **Genetics**:
  - Heterogeneous condition with numerous causative mutations.
  - Most commonly inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

- **Family History**: 
  - Strong family history of coronary heart disease is often present.
  - Hypercholesterolaemia plays a role in [[atherosclerosis]] pathogenesis.

- **Combination Factors**: 
  - FH often combines with lifestyle factors to elevate cholesterol levels.

- **Referral Criteria** (according to NICE):
  - Total cholesterol > 7.5 mmol/L.
  - Family history of early coronary heart disease (cardiac event before age 60 in a first-degree relative).
  - **Action**: Referral for genetic testing recommended.
