Turner syndrome is a common chromosomal disorder caused by the loss of a sex chromosome, affecting females (45X0). It can be complete (missing one X chromosome) or mosaic (one X chromosome missing in some cells). Approximately 1 in 2,000-2,500 live female births is affected.

### Diagnosis

Features of Turner syndrome may include:
- **Premature ovarian failure** (gonadal dysgenesis)
- **Short stature**
- **Infertility**
- **Heart anomalies** (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta)
- **Kidney malformations** (e.g., horseshoe kidney, renal agenesis)
- **Learning disabilities**
- **Physical features**:
  - Short neck with a webbed appearance
  - Broad chest, widely spaced nipples (shield chest)
  - Pigmented nevi
  - Low hairline
- **Hearing problems** (e.g., hearing loss, recurrent otitis media)
- **Eye problems** (e.g., strabismus, amblyopia, cataracts)

### Investigations

- Diagnosis often occurs in early childhood; may be missed until adulthood.
- Suspected in girls with unexplained short stature.
- Screening via maternal blood sample; confirmed via chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis (10-12 weeks).
- Ultrasound may reveal cystic hygroma, thick neck tissue, lymphoedema, or small foetal size.
- Karyotyping is done via blood sample for clinical diagnosis.
- Postnatally, MRI can identify structural abnormalities (renal, cardiac).
- Regular thyroid testing due to autoimmune thyroid disease risk.
- Routine auditory exams, especially in children, to prevent developmental delays.

### Management (non-prescribing)

- Treatment is individualized and may involve different specialists (surgeons, paediatricians, endocrinologists, ophthalmologists, psychologists).
- No cure exists, but therapies can enhance quality of life:
  - **Growth hormone therapy** for some patients.
  - **Sex hormone therapy** for puberty and development continuation until menopause.
  - Infertility is common, but IVF may be an option for some.
