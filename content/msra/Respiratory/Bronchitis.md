**Bronchitis Overview**
- **Definition**: Inflammation of bronchi in the lower respiratory tract.
- **Symptoms**: [[Cough]] (may include sputum), lasting 1-3 weeks for acute bronchitis; a [[Cough]] lasting 3 months or more for chronic bronchitis.
- **Seasonality**: Higher incidence in colder seasons.
- **Preceding Conditions**: Often follows an upper respiratory tract infection.
- **Complications**: Rare; may include bacterial superinfection or [[Pneumonia]].

**Common Pathogens**
- **Viral Causes**: 
  - [[Influenza]]
  - Parainfluenza
  - Human metapneumovirus
  - Rhinovirus
  - Coronavirus
  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
  
- **Bacterial Causes**: 
  - Bordetella pertussis
  - Mycoplasma pneumoniae
  - [[Chlamydia]] pneumoniae

**Diagnosis**
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: [[Cough]] lasting 1-3 weeks, absence of [[Pneumonia]] signs (fever, dullness), wheezing, and rhonchi.
- **Investigations if Suspected**: 
  - [[Pneumonia]]: [[Cough]] with fever, tachypnoea/tachycardia, consolidation.
  - [[Influenza]]: sudden onset [[Cough]] with high fever.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- **Conditions to Consider**: 
  - [[Pneumonia]]
  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ([[GORD]])
  - [[msra/Respiratory/Asthma|Asthma]]
  - ACE inhibitor effects
  - [[Heart failure]]
  - [[msra/Respiratory/Pulmonary embolism|Pulmonary embolism]]

**Investigations**
- **Chest X-ray**: Needed if [[Pneumonia]] is suspected.
- **Microbiology**: Typically not needed unless [[Influenza]] or pertussis is suspected.
- **Procalcitonin Analysis**: Can help distinguish bacterial from viral infections.

**Management (Prescribing)**
- **[[Cough]] Relief**: Over-the-counter medications; NSAIDs for myalgia.
- **Antibiotics**: Generally not recommended except for:
  - **Bordetella pertussis**: macrolides for [[Cough]] < 3 weeks or pregnant women with [[Cough]] < 6 weeks.
  - **[[Influenza]]**: Treatment for high-risk patients; first-line agents are neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir).

**Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- **Symptom Control**: Important as symptoms are self-limited.
- **Non-Pharmacological Aids**: Throat lozenges, honey, counseling for [[Smoking cessation]].
