**Bronchitis Overview**
- **Definition**: Inflammation of bronchi in the lower respiratory tract.
- **Symptoms**: Cough (may include sputum), lasting 1-3 weeks for acute bronchitis; a cough lasting 3 months or more for chronic bronchitis.
- **Seasonality**: Higher incidence in colder seasons.
- **Preceding Conditions**: Often follows an upper respiratory tract infection.
- **Complications**: Rare; may include bacterial superinfection or pneumonia.

**Common Pathogens**
- **Viral Causes**: 
  - Influenza
  - Parainfluenza
  - Human metapneumovirus
  - Rhinovirus
  - Coronavirus
  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
  
- **Bacterial Causes**: 
  - Bordetella pertussis
  - Mycoplasma pneumoniae
  - Chlamydia pneumoniae

**Diagnosis**
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Cough lasting 1-3 weeks, absence of pneumonia signs (fever, dullness), wheezing, and rhonchi.
- **Investigations if Suspected**: 
  - Pneumonia: cough with fever, tachypnoea/tachycardia, consolidation.
  - Influenza: sudden onset cough with high fever.

**Differential Diagnosis**
- **Conditions to Consider**: 
  - Pneumonia
  - Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)
  - Asthma
  - ACE inhibitor effects
  - Heart failure
  - Pulmonary embolism

**Investigations**
- **Chest X-ray**: Needed if pneumonia is suspected.
- **Microbiology**: Typically not needed unless influenza or pertussis is suspected.
- **Procalcitonin Analysis**: Can help distinguish bacterial from viral infections.

**Management (Prescribing)**
- **Cough Relief**: Over-the-counter medications; NSAIDs for myalgia.
- **Antibiotics**: Generally not recommended except for:
  - **Bordetella pertussis**: macrolides for cough < 3 weeks or pregnant women with cough < 6 weeks.
  - **Influenza**: Treatment for high-risk patients; first-line agents are neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir).

**Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- **Symptom Control**: Important as symptoms are self-limited.
- **Non-Pharmacological Aids**: Throat lozenges, honey, counseling for smoking cessation.
