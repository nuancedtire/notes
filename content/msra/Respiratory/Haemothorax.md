A haemothorax is the accumulation of blood in the pleural space, often due to trauma or iatrogenic causes, with rare spontaneous occurrences. It can be life-threatening, particularly when large volumes of blood accumulate rapidly (massive haemothorax), necessitating a primary survey in trauma patients. While severe cases may require surgery, most haemothoraces are managed with thoracostomy and chest drainage.

### Diagnosis and Investigations
- **Suspected in**: Patients with blunt/penetrating chest trauma, [[chest pain]], or dyspnoea.
- **Examination findings**: Reduced breath sounds, dulled percussion note, signs of haemodynamic instability.
- **Imaging**:
  - Chest radiographs may miss pleural effusions.
  - Ultrasound preferred in emergency settings for higher sensitivity.
- **Diagnosis**: Confirmed by pleural fluid analysis (haematocrit â‰¥ 0.5 of peripheral blood) via thoracocentesis or thoracostomy.

### Management of Emergencies
- **Massive haemothorax**: Life-threatening; defined as:
  - >1,500 mL blood drained upon initial chest drain insertion.
  - Blood loss >200 mL/hr for 2-4 hours.
- **Primary survey needed**: Start oxygen, use cautious fluid resuscitation, consider blood transfusion (1:1 packed red cells to fresh frozen plasma), and administer tranexamic acid.
- **Definitive management**: Requires surgical intervention to prevent further bleeding, with immediate cardiothoracic team involvement. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is preferred over thoracotomy.

### Non-Prescribing Management
- **Chest drain insertion**: In the triangle of safety to aid in draining blood and preventing complications:
  - Clots in pleural space.
  - Empyema.
  - Pleural effusion.
  - Fibrothorax.

### Prescribing Management
- **Antibiotics**: May be necessary for prophylaxis or treatment of empyema.
- **Fibrinolytic therapy**: Used cautiously to treat clots due to potential risk of causing haemothoraces.
