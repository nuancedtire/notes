## COPD Overview

- **Definition**: Progressive lung disease primarily caused by cigarette smoking.
- **Symptoms**: Shortness of breath, chronic cough, decreased quality of life. 

## Diagnosis

- **Suspicion**: Significant smoking history + symptoms (dyspnoea, chronic cough).
- **Formal Diagnosis**: Requires irreversible airflow obstruction on spirometry.
- **Key Symptoms**:
  - Decreased exercise tolerance
  - Wheeze
- **Signs**:
  - Tachypnoea
  - Prolonged expiratory phase
  - Barrel chest
  - Increased work of breathing
  - Wheeze
  - Basal crepitations
  - Signs of right heart failure (cor pulmonale).

### Causes

- **Primary**: Cigarette smoking (≥ 20 pack years).
- **Other Causes**: Environmental/occupational exposures (cadmium, coal), alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (screen for if young age, minimal smoking history, family history, unexplained liver disease).

## Investigations

- **Spirometry**: FEV1/FVC ratio < 70% indicates airway obstruction. Severity classified by % predicted FEV1. 
- **Chest X-ray**: Not diagnostic but to rule out other pathologies. May show lung hyperinflation, flattened diaphragm, bullae.
- **O2 Saturations and Blood Gas**: Essential for considering oxygen therapy.
- **Blood Tests**:
  - α1-antitrypsin levels (indications as above)
  - FBC
- **ECG/Echocardiogram**: If cor pulmonale suspected.

## Emergency Management

- **Exacerbations**: May be emergencies; worsened by respiratory infections.
- **Management**:
  - Assess vital signs.
  - Controlled oxygen therapy (Venturi mask, target SpO2 88-92%).
  - Blood gas, CXR, ECG, FBC, inflammatory markers, U&Es.
  - Bronchodilator nebulizer.
  - Short-term oral steroids.
  - Consider antibiotics for pneumonia.
  - Non-invasive/invasive ventilation for respiratory acidosis.
  - Early pulmonary rehabilitation.

## Non-prescribing Management 

- **Smoking Cessation**: Most critical intervention to slow disease progression.
- **Rehabilitation**: Pulmonary rehab and dietary changes improve symptoms and quality of life.
- **Vaccinations**: One-off pneumococcal vaccine; annual influenza vaccine.
- **Surgery**: Lung transplantation for young patients with severe disease.

## Prescribing Management

- **Initial Treatment**: Short-acting beta-2 agonists (SABA) or short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMA) if non-pharmacological interventions fail.
- **Options**:
  - Prophylactic antibiotics in select patients.
  - Mucolytics (e.g., carbocysteine) for chronic productive cough.

### Management Steps by Severity

- Severity stages I, II, III, IV categorized by FEV1.
- SABA = short-acting beta-2-agonist; SAMA = short-acting muscarinic antagonist; LABA = long-acting beta-2-agonist; LAMA = long-acting muscarinic antagonist.
