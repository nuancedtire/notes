Asbestosis Overview
- Chronic pulmonary disease from inhaling asbestos fibers
- Type of pneumoconiosis
- Common past exposure (occupational/non-occupational)
- Characterized by interstitial fibrosis, especially in lower lobes beneath pleura
- Asbestos causes direct (macrophage activation) and indirect lung damage (ROS and free radicals)

Symptoms
- Asymptomatic for 20-30 years post-exposure
- Progressive shortness of breath and hypoxaemia (initially with exercise, later at rest)
- Possible benign unilateral pleural effusion before fibrosis
- Cough, wheezing, and sputum production are typically not present

### Diagnosis
- Based on asbestos exposure history and imaging findings
- Histopathological exam not usually required
- Key diagnostic points:
  1. Latency period from exposure to symptoms
  2. Evidence of interstitial fibrosis (end-inspiratory crackles, pulmonary function tests, imaging abnormalities)

#### Differential Diagnosis
- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
- Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)
- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis

### Investigations

**Physical Examination:**
- End-inspiratory crackles (up to 65%)
- Clubbing (up to 40%)

**Laboratory Exams:**
- Nonspecific

**Pulmonary Function Tests:**
- Lung volume measurements and DLCO
- Findings:
  - Reduced VC and TLC
  - Reduced DLCO
  - Normal FEV1/FVC ratio

**Imaging:**
- **CXR:** Bilateral "ground glass" opacities and pleural plaques; honeycombing in late stages.
- **HRCT:** More sensitive than CXR for detecting abnormalities.

**Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL):**
- Asbestos body count in fluid correlates with lung asbestos body count; used if CXR/HRCT are not diagnostic.

**Histopathological Examination:**
- Asbestos bodies and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
  - Asbestos bodies: coated fibers (iron/protein)
  - Fibrosis differs from UIP (no fibroblast foci; visceral pleura involvement)

### Management (Prescribing)
- No pharmacological treatment
- Oxygen therapy for hypoxaemia/severe dyspnea
- Prevention and supportive care; pneumococcus and influenza vaccinations recommended

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Surgery (scar tissue removal/lung transplant) for severe cases
- Thoracentesis for pleural effusion relief
