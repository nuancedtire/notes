## Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE)

- **Definition**: Obstruction of the pulmonary artery or its branches by material from elsewhere (thrombus, tumor, air, fat).
- **Origin**: Most emboli arise from lower extremity proximal veins (iliac, femoral, popliteal).
- **Prevalence**: Common and dangerous; mortality in England and Wales is 30,000–40,000/year.

### Diagnosis

#### Symptoms:
- Acute breathlessness
- Pleuritic [[chest pain]]
- Haemoptysis
- Dizziness
- Syncope

#### Signs:
- Pyrexia
- Cyanosis
- Tachypnoea
- Tachycardia
- Hypotension
- Raised JVP
- Pleural rub/effusion
- Swollen lower limb

#### Risk Factors for DVT:
- Recent surgery (abdominal/pelvic, hip/knee replacement)
- Thrombophilia (e.g., antiphospholipid syndrome)
- Leg fracture
- Prolonged bed rest/reduced mobility
- Malignancy
- Pregnancy/postpartum; Pill/HRT
- Previous PE

#### Wells' Criteria for PE
| Feature                                                          | Score |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT                               | 3     |
| PE is the #1 diagnosis or equally likely diagnosis              | 3     |
| Heart rate >100                                                 | 1.5   |
| Immobilisation at least 3 days or surgery in past 4 weeks      | 1.5   |
| Previous, objectively diagnosed PE or DVT                        | 1.5   |
| Haemoptysis                                                     | 1     |
| Malignancy with treatment in past 6 months or palliative       | 1     |

**Total Wells' score**:
- 4 or less: PE unlikely; consider D-dimer
- 4 or more: PE likely; consider diagnostic imaging

### Investigations

- **CT Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA)**: First-line imaging; sensitive and specific.
- **Ventilation-Perfusion (V/Q) Scan**: Alternative if CTPA is unavailable.
- **Serum D-dimers**: High sensitivity, low specificity; use in low probability patients (Wells <4). Negative results exclude PE.
- **Other Investigations**: ECG, Chest X-ray, ABG.

### Management of Emergencies

#### Hemodynamically Unstable PE
- Defined as hypotension (systolic BP <90 mmHg or drop ≥40 mmHg).
- Requires urgent thrombolysis (50mg alteplase), IV access, resuscitation, and heparin.
- For systolic BP <90mmHg: Start rapid colloid infusion, consider ICU for further management.

### Management (Acute)

#### Stable Patients
- **First-line**: Respiratory support with supplemental oxygen (target SpO₂ 94-98%).
- Anticoagulation: 
  - **DOACs** (apixaban or rivaroxaban) immediate initiation without prior parenteral treatment.
  - **LMWH and warfarin** if DOACs are contraindicated.

#### Unstable Patients
- Systemic thrombolytic therapy (e.g., tPA) followed by anticoagulation.
- **Absolute Contraindications**: Intracranial neoplasm, recent intracranial/spinal trauma/surgery, history of hemorrhagic stroke, active bleeding.
- **Relative Contraindications**: Severe uncontrolled hypertension, recent non-hemorrhagic stroke, recent surgery, pregnancy.
- **Embolectomy**: Indicated for unstable patients contraindicated for thrombolytics.

### Management (Long Term)

- **Duration**: 3-6 months based on known cause.
- **DOAC Dosages**: 
  - **Apixaban**: 10 mg BID for 7 days, then 5 mg BID (≥3 months).
  - **Rivaroxaban**: 15 mg BID (days 1-21), then 20 mg QD (≥3 months).
  - **Dabigatran**: 150 mg BID (ages 18-74); adjusted for older adults.
  - **Edoxaban**: 60 mg QD (≥3 months); 30 mg QD for specific populations.
- **Inferior Vena Cava (IVC) Filters**: Consider for those not candidates for anticoagulants or with recurrent PE.
