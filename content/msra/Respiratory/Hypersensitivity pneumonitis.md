### Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP)

- **Description**: Complex interstitial lung disease, previously called extrinsic allergic alveolitis. Caused by hypersensitivity to inhaled organic substances, leading to inflamed alveoli and lung parenchyma.
- **Key Management**: Allergen avoidance is central to treatment.

### Diagnosis

- **Challenges**: No gold standard test; diagnosis is difficult.
- **Signs and Symptoms**:
  - Non-specific: dry cough, progressive breathlessness, weight loss, fever, myalgia.
  - Lung Auscultation: inspiratory crackles, variable squeaks.
- **Types of Antigens**: Various antigens cause HP; e.g., Farmerâ€™s lung (mouldy straw) is prevalent in the UK.
- **Classification**: Acute and chronic forms based on the clinical feature timeline.

### Investigations

- **Imaging**:
  - Chest X-ray, high-resolution CT: shows diffuse ground-glass opacities.
- **Pulmonary Function Tests**: Indicate a restrictive pattern of lung disease.
- **Blood Tests**: Neutrophilia, raised inflammatory markers.
- **Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL)**: Shows lymphocytosis.
- **Lung Biopsy**: Reveals lymphocytic inflammation.

### Management (Non-prescribing)

- **Allergen Avoidance**: Essential for managing HP. Prognosis is generally excellent with complete avoidance.
- **Risk Reduction**: If avoidance is impossible, reduce exposure (e.g., improve ventilation, use positive pressure face masks).

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Corticosteroids**: 
  - Oral corticosteroids may be used for acute symptoms.
  - Long courses for chronic HP may be necessary.
  - Limited evidence on long-term effect of steroids on outcomes.
