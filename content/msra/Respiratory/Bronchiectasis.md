- **Definition**: Bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by enlarged, inflamed airways that risk collapsing.

- **Prevalence**: Increases with age; more common in women.

- **Inducing Factors**:
  - Infection
  - Impaired host immune response
  - Tracheobronchomalacia
  - Focal airway obstruction
  - Smoking
  - Genetic diseases (e.g., [[Cystic Fibrosis]], primary ciliary dyskinesia)

- **Pathophysiology**: 
  - Abnormal inflammatory response (predominantly neutrophilic) leads to airway dilatation and destruction.

- **Complications**: 
  - Can occur with [[msra/Musculoskeletal/Rheumatoid Arthritis|Rheumatoid Arthritis]] and Sjögren's syndrome; the reason for this association is unknown.

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Persistent [[Cough]] with purulent sputum (often daily)
  - Viscous and darker sputum during acute exacerbations
  - Symptoms: dyspnea, wheezing, [[chest pain]]
  - History of multiple respiratory infections

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Based on symptoms like persistent productive [[Cough]].
- **Imaging**: 
  - **MDCT**: Confirms airway dilatation.
    - Criteria for diagnosis:
      - Bronchoarterial ratio > 1 
      - No tapering of bronchi
      - Airway proximity to pleural surface < 1 cm
- **CT distribution indicative of causes**:
  - Central/perihilar: allergic aspergillosis
  - Upper lobe: cystic fibrosis
  - Middle/lower lobe: primary ciliary dysfunction
  - Lower lobe: idiopathic bronchiectasis

### Investigations
- **Laboratory Tests**:
  - CBC
  - Immunoelectrophoresis (immunodeficiencies)
  - Cystic fibrosis testing (sweat test/mutation analysis)
  - Sputum culture (pathogens)
  
- **Imaging**:
  - **CXR**: Non-specific findings; may show atelectasis, “tram track” sign.
  - **MDCT**: More specific for bronchiectasis.

- **Pulmonary Function Testing**:
  - Spirometry may show an obstructive pattern (if severe).

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Goals**: Decrease inflammation and manage infections.
- **Supportive Treatments**:
  - Mucolytic agents and hydration to clear secretions.
- **Preventative Therapies**:
  - Treat non-tuberculous mycobacteria.
  - IVIG for primary immunodeficiencies.
  - Glucocorticoids/antifungals for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.

- **Antibiotics** (for acute exacerbations):
  - Duration: 10-14 days (few exacerbations).
  - Selection based on previous therapies and sputum analysis.
    - No analysis: oral fluoroquinolone
    - No resistance: oral amoxicillin/macrolide
    - Positive beta-lactamase: oral amoxicillin-clavulanate, fluoroquinolone, cephalosporin, macrolide
    - Sensitive Pseudomonas: oral ciprofloxacin
    - Resistant Pseudomonas: hospitalization and IV antibiotics.

- **Long-term therapy**: For recurrent exacerbations (> 2-3 per year).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Address contributing conditions**: 
  - Dysphagia or [[GORD]] treatment to prevent aspirations.
- **Airway Clearance Therapy**: 
  - Physical techniques or devices for secretions clearance.
- **Surgical Options**: 
  - Lobectomy for damaged lobes or to control hemoptysis.
  - Bilateral lung transplant as a resolutive option.
  - Stenting or tracheobronchoplasty for tracheobronchomegaly.
