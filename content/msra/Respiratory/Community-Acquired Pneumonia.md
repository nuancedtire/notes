## Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)

### Overview
- Common lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) acquired outside healthcare settings.
- Outcomes range from resolution with oral antibiotics to hospitalization with high morbidity and mortality.
- Severity assessment tools (e.g., CRB-65) help determine appropriate clinical care.

### Diagnosis
- Typical symptoms: fever, productive cough, dyspnoea, pleuritic [[chest pain]].
- Diagnosis suggested with localizing signs (e.g., crackles), evidence on chest imaging.
- CRB-65 score aids in management triage decisions.

#### CRB-65 Score (Table 1)
| Clinical Feature | Points |
|---|---|
| Confusion (C) | 1 |
| Urea > 7 mmol/L (U)  | 1 |
| Respiratory rate ≥ 30 (R) | 1 |
| Blood pressure < 90/60 mm Hg (B) | 1 |
| Age ≥ 65 years (65) | 1 |

*CURB-65 used for hospital settings.

#### CURB-65 Recommendations (Table 2)
| CURB-65 Score | 30-Day Mortality Risk | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| 0 or 1 | 1-2% = low | Home treatment |
| 2 | 9% = intermediate | Consider hospital (inpatient/outpatient) |
| 3 or more | 15-40% = high | Hospital – assess need for intensive care |

### Investigations
- Community-managed cases typically require basic observations only.
- Chest X-ray (CXR) useful for diagnostic uncertainty or hospital admission consideration.
- Characteristic CXR findings include consolidation in lower lobes.
- Blood tests: FBC, U&Es, LFTs, CRP for severe infection markers.

#### Microbiological Investigations
- Important for moderate/high severity CAP (hospitalization needed):
  - Blood cultures (before antibiotics).
  - Sputum culture and sensitivity.
  - Atypical bacteria tests: Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae.

### Management (Prescribing)
- Start empirical antibiotics as per local protocols.

#### Empirical Antibiotics for CAP (Table 3)
| CAP Severity | Antibiotic(s) | Course |
|---|---|---|
| Low | Oral amoxicillin 50 mg | TDS for 5-7 days |
| Moderate | Oral/IV amoxicillin + macrolide (e.g., clarithromycin) | 7-10 days |
| Severe | IV co-amoxiclav + macrolide | Switch to oral after clinical improvement |

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- General management needs:
  - Oxygen for hypoxia.
  - Fluids if dehydrated.

### Follow-Up
- Recommended at 6 weeks with clinical review.
- Repeat CXR if persistent signs/symptoms or high risk for lung pathology.
- Vaccinations for 'high risk' patients, including adults over 65 years.
