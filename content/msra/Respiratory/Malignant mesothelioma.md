Malignant mesothelioma is an aggressive epithelial neoplasm that originates from the mesothelial lining of the lung, abdomen, pericardium, or tunica vaginalis. The majority of these cases are malignant pleural mesotheliomas, primarily linked to asbestos exposure, which has a latency period of 20-40 years.

### Diagnosis

- **Age of Onset:** Symptoms usually appear in the 60s-90s, often indicating advanced disease.
- **History Taking:** A detailed history is crucial due to strong links between exposure and diagnosis. Lack of asbestos exposure doesn't exclude mesothelioma. Other risk factors include:
  - Family history (e.g., BAP-1 mutations)
  - Radiation exposure
- **Occupational Risk Factors:** Shipyard workers, construction, maintenance, vehicle brake mechanics, insulation, tile, shingle, gasket, or textile production.

#### Symptoms
- **Common Symptoms:**
  - Shortness of breath
  - Dry, non-productive [[Cough]]
  - [[Chest pain]]

- **Non-specific Symptoms:**
  - Fatigue
  - Anorexia
  - Weight loss

#### Physical Exam Findings
- Decreased breath sounds
- Reduced chest expansion
- Dullness to percussion on the affected side
- Abdominal distension may indicate ascites or intra-abdominal mesothelioma.

### Investigations

1. **Imaging Studies:**
   - Initial: Chest X-ray
     - Possible findings: Unilateral pleural effusion, pleural thickening, reduced lung volumes, or parenchymal changes.
   - Follow-Up: Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest and upper abdomen if suspicion persists.

2. **Further Investigations:**
   - Thoracentesis for pleural fluid analysis (exudate vs. transudate, cytology).
   - Biopsy confirmation via Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS).
   - Additional: 
     - PET scan post-diagnosis to check regional or distant disease.
     - Pulmonary function tests (FEV1 and DLCO) for surgical evaluation.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Chemotherapy:**
  - Preoperative in resectable cases or palliative in inoperable/recurrent cases.
- **Effective Agents:**
  - Cisplatin
  - Carboplatin
  - Pemetrexed

- **Side Effects:**
  - Cisplatin: Nephrotoxicity, nausea, vomiting.
  - Carboplatin: Preferred for better safety profile and ease of administration.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

#### Surgery
1. **Extra-pleural Pneumonectomy:** Removal of the pleura, lung, pericardium, and hemidiaphragm en bloc.
2. **Pleurectomy with Decortication:** Removal of the parietal pleura, visceral pleura, and other associated structures.

#### Radiotherapy
- Post-operative radiotherapy to the ipsilateral chest cavity may be used for adjuvant therapy or symptom relief.

#### Palliative Procedures
- **Thoracocentesis:** Relieves symptoms caused by pleural effusion.
- **Pleurodesis:** Prevents re-accumulation of pleural fluid using agents like talc.
