**Tuberculosis (TB) Overview**

- **Causative Agent:** _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_
- **Prevalence:** Most common fatal bacterial infection; ~30% of the global population has latent TB.
- **Common Regions:** Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, influenced by malnutrition and overcrowding.

**Disease Progression:**

1. **Primary TB:**
   - Initial lesion (Ghon focus) develops in the lungs after exposure.
   - Comprised mainly of macrophages; can form a granuloma with caseating necrosis.
   - Hilar lymph node involvement leads to Ghon complex.
   - In healthy individuals, Ghon focus may fibrose, leading to latent TB.
   - Immunocompromised patients risk developing disseminated TB (miliary tuberculosis).

2. **Secondary TB:**
   - Reactivation of primary infection in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., malnutrition or immunosuppressive drugs).
   - Typically occurs in lung apices but can spread to other sites:
     - GI tract
     - CNS (tuberculous meningitis)
     - Vertebral bodies (Pott’s disease)
     - Kidneys
     - Pericardium 

**Symptoms:**
- Prolonged symptoms (weeks/months), including:
  - Weight loss
  - Fever
  - Night sweats
  - Anorexia
  - Cough (with or without hemoptysis)
  - Dyspnea
  - Enlarged, firm, non-tender lymph nodes (cervical/supraclavicular)
  - Headache (CNS TB)
  - Backache (Pott’s disease)
  - Symptoms of Addison’s disease

**Diagnosis:**

- **Transmission:** Respiratory droplets; ~8 hours of exposure needed to contract TB.
- **Mantoux Test:**
  - 0.1 ml of 1:1,000 purified protein derivative injected intradermally.
  - Induration read 2-3 days later:
    - <6mm: Not exposed; candidate for BCG vaccination.
    - 6-15mm: Possible prior exposure or BCG vaccination.
    - >15mm: Strong indication of infection.
- **Sputum Cultures:**
  - Three early morning samples for suspected active TB; can take up to 6 weeks.
  - Up to 20% may show negative results.
- **Ziehl-Neelsen Staining:** Used for diagnosing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ from cultures.
- **Nucleic Acid Amplification:** Rapid testing; not recommended by NICE due to cost.
- **Radiology:** Chest x-rays and CT may reveal consolidation, lymph nodes, and cavitation, especially in upper lobes.

**Management:**

- **Pharmacological Treatment:**
  - First 2 months: Rifampicin, Isoniazid, Pyrazinamide, Ethambutol.
  - Remaining 4 months: Rifampicin and Isoniazid.
  - For extra-pulmonary disease/meningeal TB: 12 months total treatment.
  - Patients on Isoniazid should receive Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) to prevent neuropathy.

- **Non-Prescribing Management:**
  - Surgical intervention may be needed for miliary TB.
  - Pott’s disease may require spinal fusion or decompression surgery.
  - Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) recommended for those with poor adherence (e.g., alcoholics, homeless).
