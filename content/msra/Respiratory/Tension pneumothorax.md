### Tension Pneumothorax Overview
- **Cause**: Gradual air build-up in the pleural space due to a one-way valve effect from chest/lung injury.
- **Common Cause**: Mechanical ventilation in a patient with a simple pneumothorax prior to chest drain insertion.
- **Other Causes**: Blunt trauma, penetrating injury, central venous catheter placement, lung biopsy.
- **Effects**: Lung collapse, hypoxia, mediastinal shift, impaired venous return to heart.
- **Emergency**: Immediate treatment required to prevent traumatic arrest.

### Diagnosis
- **Symptoms**:
  - [[Chest pain]]
  - Tachypnoea
  - Tachycardia
  - Raised JVP, distended neck veins
  - Pulsus paradoxus
  - Reduced breath sounds (affected side)
  - Hyper-resonance, decreased movement (affected side)
  - Tracheal deviation away from affected side
  - Hypotension, loss of consciousness (if severe)

- **Considerations**: Symptoms may overlap with cardiac tamponade/diaphragmatic injuries.

### Investigations
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Imaging may confirm but should not delay treatment.
- **Imaging Findings**:
  - Hemidiaphragmatic depression
  - Ipsilateral flattening of heart border
  - Contralateral mediastinal deviation

### Emergency Management
- **Cardiac Arrest**: Perform needle decompression to restore cardiac output.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Oxygen**: Administer high-flow oxygen (target SpO2 > 96%).
- **Analgesia**: Provide sufficient analgesia (e.g., morphine).
- **Antibiotics**: Prophylactic broad-spectrum cephalosporins for chest trauma patients.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Immediate Decompression Indications**:
  - Systolic BP < 90 mmHg
  - Respiratory rate < 10/min
  - SpOâ‚‚ < 92% on oxygen
  - Reduced consciousness on oxygen
  - Cardiac arrest

- **Decompression Technique**:
  - Insert cannula in 4th/5th intercostal space (mid-axillary line) per ATLS guidelines.
  - Both 2nd intercostal space (mid-clavicular line) and 4th/5th are accepted per Resuscitation Council guidelines.
  
- **Confirmation**: Immediate rush of air denotes diagnosis change from tension to simple pneumothorax.

- **Follow-Up**: If unsuccessful, insert chest drain in the safe triangle for pleural space management.
  - Safe triangle boundaries: lateral border of pectoralis major, anterior border of latissimus dorsi, and horizontal line at nipple base with apex in the axilla.
  - Leave drain until no air escapes and confirm lung re-expansion on chest x-ray.
  - If air leakage persists after 2-4 days, surgical intervention may be necessary.
