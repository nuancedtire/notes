## Bronchopneumonia Overview

- **Definition**: Subtype of [[Pneumonia]] with inflammation of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli.
- **Alternate Name**: Lobular [[Pneumonia]] (patchy consolidations in lobules).
- **Population**: More common in children and the elderly.
- **Cause**: Usually bacterial infections, often hospital-acquired (HAP).

### Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP)

- **Definition**: Develops >48 hours after hospital admission.
- **Main Risk Factor**: Mechanical ventilation.
  
#### Additional Risk Factors
- Old age
- Chronic pulmonary diseases
- Esophageal diseases
- Previous antibiotic exposure
- Paralysis
- Decreased consciousness

### Clinical Presentation
- High-grade fever
- Productive [[Cough]]
- Shortness of breath
- Tachypnoea
- Possible [[chest pain]], pleurisy, haemoptysis
- Complication: Can evolve into [[Sepsis]]

### Potential Causes of Bronchopneumonia/HAP

#### Gram-positive Organisms
- Staphylococcus aureus (including [[MRSA]])
- Streptococcus pneumoniae (less common)

#### Gram-negative Organisms
- Klebsiella pneumoniae
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa
- Escherichia coli

#### Fungal Causes
- Histoplasma capsulatum (especially in immunocompromised)
- _Ab ingestis_ bronchopneumonia

## Diagnosis

- Based on clinical suspicion with symptoms such as:
  - Fever
  - Productive [[Cough]] with purulent sputum
  - Leucocytosis/leukopenia
  - Dyspnoea
  - Decreased oxygen saturation

### Auscultation Findings
- Rales/crackles
- Reduced lung sounds

### Investigations

**Full Blood Count (FBC)**
- Leucocytosis with high granulocytes.

**Imaging**
- **Chest X-ray (CXR)**: Gold standard; shows patchy opacities in lower lobes.
- **CT Scan**: If CXR is non-diagnostic; "tree-in-bud" appearance.

**Microbiological Analysis**
- Sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for pathogen identification.
- Serology for Histoplasma capsulatum.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Outpatient Treatment**: Follow local antimicrobial guidelines (e.g., amoxicillin or clarithromycin).
- **HAP Management**: Depends on risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.

### Empiric Therapy
- **No Risk Factors for MDR**: Single agent coverage (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam, cefepime).
- **With Risk Factors for MDR**: Combination therapy (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam + aminoglycoside + vancomycin).

### Duration of Therapy
- Typically around 7 days.
- PCT may help assess clinical response.

### Specific Therapy
- Narrowed once microbiological analysis results are available.

**Histoplasmosis Treatment**: Antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B for severe cases).

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Rest and Symptomatic Care**
- **Hydration**: IV preferred for hospitalized patients.
- **Oxygen Therapy**: Maintain >94% saturation.
- **Hospitalization Criteria**: Use CURB-65.

### Prevention
- [[Smoking cessation]]
- Vaccination against [[Influenza]] and pneumococcus.
