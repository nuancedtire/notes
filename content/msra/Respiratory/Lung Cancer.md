### Lung Cancer Overview

- **Definition**: Lung cancer (bronchogenic carcinoma) originates in airways or lung parenchyma. 
- **Types**:
  - **Small cell lung cancer (SCLC)** 
  - **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)** (95% of cases): Includes adenocarcinoma, [[Squamous cell carcinoma]], large cell carcinoma. 
  - **Other cell types**: ~5% of cases.

### Diagnosis

- **Late-stage diagnosis** common.
- **Clinical manifestations** can arise from:
  1. Intrathoracic effects
  2. Extrathoracic metastases
  3. Paraneoplastic phenomena

**Intrathoracic effects**:
- [[Cough]]
- Haemoptysis
- [[Chest pain]]
- Dyspnoea
- Hoarseness (due to recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement)
- Pleural disease (malignant pleural effusion)
- Pancoast syndrome ([[Shoulder pain]], Horner syndrome, bony destruction)

**Extrathoracic metastasis** (commonly affected organs):
- Liver
- Bone
- Brain
- Adrenal glands

**Paraneoplastic phenomena**:
- Hypercalcemia (due to bone metastasis or PTHrP secretion)
- Cushing syndrome (ectopic ACTH production)
- SIADH (commonly in SCLC leading to [[Hyponatraemia]])
- Neurologic syndromes (e.g., Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome)

**Risk Factors**:
- Cigarette smoking (90% of lung cancer cases)
- Radiation therapy
- Environmental toxins (e.g., asbestos, radon)
- Pulmonary fibrosis
- Alcohol
- HIV
- Family history

### Investigations

**Laboratory investigations**:
- Full blood count
- Urea and Electrolytes
- Calcium
- Alkaline phosphatase
- ALT, AST, bilirubin
- Creatinine

**Radiological investigations**:
- CT scan of chest, lower neck, upper abdomen with IV contrast for tumor extent and metastasis evaluation.

**Biopsy**:
- NSCLC diagnosis via cytologic (pleural fluid) or histopathologic (tissue biopsy) specimens.

**Staging**:
- NSCLC: Tumour, Node, Metastasis (TNM) system.
- SCLC: 
  - Limited stage (ipsilateral hemithorax)
  - Extensive stage (including metastatic disease)

### Management (Prescribing)

**NSCLC**:
- Late-stage treatment: Focus on relieving symptoms.
- Treatment based on histological subtype, molecular genotype, and PD-L1 status.
- Common agents: Chemotherapy (Cisplatin, Gemcitabine), Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs).

**SCLC**:
- Limited stage: Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide).
- Extensive stage: 4-6 cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin and etoposide, carboplatin and etoposide, cisplatin and irinotecan).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

**NSCLC**:
- Surgical resection preferred in early-stage (I-II) by thoracic surgical oncologist.
- Lobectomy favored over wedge resection. 
- Hilar and mediastinal lymph node sampling recommended.

**SCLC**:
- Surgery is rarely performed.
