**Pneumothorax Overview**
- Accumulation of air in the pleural space.
- Classifications:
  - Primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) - No underlying lung disease; often due to ruptured subpleural blebs.
  - Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) - Complication of underlying lung diseases, e.g., COPD, tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, lung malignancy.
  - Traumatic pneumothorax - Due to penetrating/non-penetrating trauma; iatrogenic (e.g., from medical procedures).

**Diagnosis**
- **Typical Presentation:**
  - PSP: Young male with acute dyspnoea and pleuritic [[chest pain]].
  - SSP: Older patients with existing lung disease.

- **Physical Examination:**
  - Small pneumothorax: Minimal findings.
  - Large pneumothorax: 
    - Reduced chest expansion on the affected side
    - Hyper-expansion of affected side
    - Diminished breath sounds
    - Absent tactile/vocal fremitus
    - Hyperresonant percussion

**Investigations**
- **Chest X-ray:**
  - First-line investigation; best viewed in inspiration.
  - Diagnostic markers: Visualization of visceral pleural line; asymmetrical lung markings.
  
- **Other Modalities:**
  - CT Chest: Best for measuring size; distinguishes between small (<2 cm) and large (≥2 cm) pneumothorax.
  - Bedside Ultrasound: Helpful when x-ray findings are unclear.
  - Arterial Blood Gas: May be abnormal (e.g., SpO2<92%).

**Management of Emergencies**
- **Tension Pneumothorax:**
  - Life-threatening; increased pressure interferes with venous return.
  - Symptoms: Severe dyspnoea, cyanosis, tachycardia, labored respiration.
  - Immediate intervention required (decompression).
  - Tracheal deviation: Late sign, not solely indicative of tension pneumothorax.

- **Decompression Technique:**
  - Insert cannula into 4th or 5th intercostal space (mid-axillary line).
  - Confirm diagnosis by rush of air.
  
**Management (Prescribing)**
- **Stable Small PSP:**
  - Conservative treatment: High flow oxygen (10 L/min), observation.
  - Oxygen therapy enhances absorption rate of pneumothorax.

**Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- **Primary Pneumothorax:**
  - Small (<2 cm): Discharge without intervention if well.
  - Large: Percutaneous needle aspiration using IV cannula at midclavicular line (2nd/3rd intercostal space). Repeat if necessary. If unsuccessful, chest-drain insertion.

- **Secondary Pneumothorax:**
  - Aspiration only if age <50 or pneumothorax <2 cm.
  - Otherwise, insert chest-drain.
  - Admission for 24 hours post-treatment for observation.
