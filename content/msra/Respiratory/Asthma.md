Asthma Overview
---------------
- **Definition**: Chronic inflammatory respiratory condition; recurring bronchial hyperresponsiveness and airway narrowing.
- **Triggers**:
  - Cold air
  - Exercise
  - Allergens
  - Aspirin or COX-1 inhibitors
  - Viral infections

### Symptoms
- Dyspnoea
- High-pitched wheezing
- [[Cough]]
- Symptoms are intermittent, often worse at night, and relieved by bronchodilators or trigger elimination.

### Demographics
- 75% diagnosed in childhood; unusual in adults without prior history.
- Family history of atopy common.

### Diagnosis
- Based on:
  - History of respiratory symptoms
  - Airflow obstruction confirmed by spirometry
- *If unclear, consider treatment trial.*

#### Differential Diagnosis
- [[COPD]] (persistent, irreversible)
- Exertional dyspnoea
- Cardiomyopathies, [[coronary artery disease]], pericarditis
- Bronchial carcinoma
- Aspiration of foreign body

### Investigations
- **Pulmonary Function Testing**:
  - **Spirometry**: FEV₁/FVC ratio < 0.7; considers reversibility.
    - Reversibility test: Predicted FEV₁ increases by ≥12% post-bronchodilator.
    - Bronchoprovocation test: Methacholine administration.
  - **Peak Expiratory Flow**: Less reliable; suggestive if improvement >20% post-bronchodilator.
- **Laboratory Tests**: Eosinophilia may indicate allergic asthma.
- **Imaging**: Chest X-ray usually normal.
- **Allergy Tests**: Can identify triggers; not for diagnosis.

### Emergency Management
#### Severe Exacerbation Signs
- Tachypnoea (>30 breaths/min)
- Tachycardia (>120 beats/min)
- Accessory muscle use
- Sweating
- Extreme dyspnoea
- Pulsus paradoxus

#### Assessment
- Measure PEF, pulse oximetry, consider ABG.
- Indicators of severe attack: PaO2 < 60 mmHg or SpO2 < 90%.

#### Management Steps
1. **Resolve Airflow Obstruction**: Inhaled bronchodilator + systemic glucocorticoid.
2. **Correct Hypoxaemia**: Supplemental oxygen.

Discharge criteria: Symptoms resolved + PEF > 80% predicted after 1 hour.

### Management (Pharmacological)
**Severity Classification**: Intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, severe persistent.

- **Intermittent**: SABA as needed.
- **Mild Persistent**: SABA + Low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid (or combinations).
- **Moderate Persistent**: SABA + Medium/Low-dose inhaled glucocorticoid + LABA or LAMA.
- **Severe Persistent**: Medium/High-dose inhaled glucocorticoid + LABA; consider leukotriene modifiers, LAMA, or biologics.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Prevention through:
  - Routine pulmonary function monitoring
  - Education on inhaler usage and trigger avoidance
  - Home monitoring via PEF measurement.
