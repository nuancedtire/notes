## Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)

- **Overview**
  - Most common skin cancer in the UK.
  - More prevalent in men and individuals with a fair complexion.
  - Locally invasive, rarely metastasizes.
  - Commonly found in sun-exposed areas of the body.

### Diagnosis

- **Histological Diagnosis:**
  - Requires biopsy, but history is crucial.
  - History often shows UV exposure but can occur in non-sun-exposed areas.

- **Risk Factors:**
  - UV light exposure
  - Sun exposure
  - X-ray exposure
  - Arsenic exposure
  - **Xeroderma Pigmentosum:** Rare genetic condition with heightened sunlight sensitivity.
  - **Basal Cell Naevus Syndrome:** Genetic condition causing multiple BCCs and increased cancer risk.

- **Skin Examination:**
  - Look for suspicious lesions.
  - Use sufficient lighting or a dermatoscope.
  - Various appearances of BCC:
    - Papules with telangiectasia (most common)
    - Rolled borders
    - Non-healing wounds
    - Pearly papules/plaque
  - **Stretch test:** BCC edges become well-defined and pearly when skin is stretched.

### Investigations

- **Histopathology Confirmation:**
  - Diagnosis confirmed via biopsy.

- **Skin Biopsy:**
  - Can be a shave or punch biopsy if ≤10mm and well-defined.
  
- **Histological Features:**
  - Cells appear large, hyperchromatic with oval nuclei and minimal cytoplasm.
  - Hypercellular stroma separated by clefts.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Excisional Surgery:**
  - First-line treatment; ~90% cure rate for full-thickness excision.
  
- **Mohs Surgery:**
  - Suitable for cosmetically sensitive areas (e.g., face).
  - Involves progressive removal until tumor-free tissue is confirmed.

- **Radiotherapy:**
  - For patients reluctant to undergo surgery; mostly for older patients due to inferior cosmetic outcomes.

- **Cryotherapy:**
  - Freezes the tumor with liquid nitrogen; applicable for superficial BCCs.

- **Topical Treatments:**
  - Imiquimod and fluorouracil available for treatment.
