Melanocytic naevi (moles) are benign neoplasms of melanocytes found in the epidermis, dermis, and occasionally subcutaneous tissue. They present as small (<1cm), acquired pigmented macules, papules, or nodules and are found randomly, mostly on the face, trunk, extremities, and scalp.

### Key Points:
- Commonly acquired; more prevalent in individuals with light skin.
- In those with pigmented skin, found more on palms, soles, and nail beds.
- No risk of malignant transformation for common naevi.
- Dysplastic (atypical) naevi carry melanoma risk based on quantity, history, and sun exposure.
- Naevi can appear from childhood to adulthood; many regress after age 60.
- Symptoms: often asymptomatic, potential itching, persistent symptoms may indicate malignancy.

### Classification of Melanocytic Naevi:
| Type | Details | Location | Description |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Junctional** | At dermal-epidermal junction | Intraepidermal | Macule, uniform color, round/oval, smooth/regular borders, <1cm diameter. |
| **Compound**   | Invades papillary dermis | Both intraepidermal and dermal | Papules/nodules, color may vary, dome-shaped, smooth/cobble-stone surface, <1cm diameter, may have hairs. |
| **Dermal**     | Last stage, cells in dermis | Intradermal | Sharply defined papule/nodule, coloration variable, may be pedunculated, <1cm diameter, may have hairs. |

### Diagnosis:
- Typically clinical; assess if congenital or acquired.
- Signs/Symptoms: Changes in shape, size, color, and any irritation.
- Use ABCDE Rule for malignancy:
  - Asymmetry
  - Border irregularity
  - Color variability
  - Diameter >6mm
  - Irregular elevation

### Investigations:
- Dermoscopy for suspicious lesions.
- Narrow margin excision biopsy if indeterminate following dermoscopy.

### Differential Diagnosis:
- **Junctional Naevi**: Solar lentigo, flat atypical naevus, lentigo maligna.
- **Compound Naevi**: Seborrheic keratosis, dysplastic naevi, superficial spreading melanoma.
- **Dermal Naevi**: Basal cell carcinoma, neurofibroma, trichoepithelioma.

### Management:
- Generally no treatment required.
- Options for cosmetic concerns/suspicions:
  - Excision biopsy (diagnostic and treatment).
  - Shave and cautery for improved cosmetic results.
  
### Indications for Removal:
- Location on scalp, mucous membranes, anogenital area.
- Rapid growth, variegated color, irregular borders, erosions without trauma, persistent symptoms, or dermoscopy findings indicative of melanoma or dysplasia.
