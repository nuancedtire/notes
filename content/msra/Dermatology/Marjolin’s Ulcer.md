### Marjolin’s Ulcers Overview
- Rare skin tumors associated with previous injury or chronic inflammation.
- Common origins: burn scars, trauma scars, pressure sores, radiation dermatitis, venous ulcers.
- Develop over a long period; more aggressive than primary skin cancers.
- Typically classified as squamous cell carcinomas, though basal cell carcinomas and malignant melanomas can also occur.
- Often missed due to slow development and atypical presentations; critical to recognize due to poor prognosis.

### **Diagnosis**
- Average presentation age: 59 years, usually 30-35 years post-injury.
- More common in men (3:1 ratio) and frequently affects lower limbs.
- Immunosuppression is a known risk factor for malignant transformation.

**Clinical Changes:**
- Classic triad:
  - Induration
  - Ulceration
  - Nodularity
- Other signs:
  - Excess granulation tissue
  - Increased exudate
  - Bleeding
  - Foul odor
  - Changes in color, size, shape, or rolled margins

### **Investigations**
- **Gold Standard:** Biopsy for histological analysis.
- Consider physical examination or ultrasound imaging for local lymph node involvement.
- CT imaging for suspected metastasis (common sites: brain, lungs, liver, lymph nodes, kidneys).

### **Management**
- Decisions made within a Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT).
- Common treatments:
  - Wide local excision
  - Mohs surgery (immediate evaluation of excised tissue)
  - Amputation for extensive local spread
  - Adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy for inoperable/metastatic cases.
