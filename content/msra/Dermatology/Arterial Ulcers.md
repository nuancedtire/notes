An ulcer is a disruption to the surface of the skin’s epithelium. An arterial ulcer (ischemic ulcer) arises from inadequate tissue perfusion due to reduced blood flow, commonly occurring in the legs and feet, often due to [[atherosclerosis]] in peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Untreated, these ulcers can lead to infection, gangrene, tissue necrosis, or amputation.

### Diagnosis

#### Epidemiology
- Arterial ulcers: 2%
- Venous ulcers: 70%
- Mixed arterial and venous disease: 15%

#### Risk Factors
- Hypertension & hypercholesterolemia
- Smoking
- Diabetes Mellitus
- Increasing age
- Positive family history

#### Aetiology
Conditions causing tissue ischemia include:
- [[Atherosclerosis]] (Peripheral Vascular Disease)
- Diabetes Mellitus
- Heart & renal failure
- Vasculitic disease
- Vasospasms
- Rheumatoid arthritis (vasculitis)
- Pressure application (arterio-occlusion)

**Diagnostic Tool:** Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire.

#### Signs & Symptoms of Ischemic Ulcers

**Signs:**
- Location: Pressure points (lateral malleolus, heel, between toes)
- Ulcer appearance: Symmetrical, well-demarcated, punched out, necrotic base.
- Surrounding skin: Shiny, hair loss
- Pulses: Absent; feet cold

**Symptoms:**
- Pain: Burning sensation, worse at night.
- Intermittent Claudication: Aching/cramping pain during exertion (ABPI 0.6-0.9).
- Rest pain: No exertion needed (ABPI 0.3-0.6).

**Mnemonic:** General characteristics of Peripheral Vascular Disease (6 P’s):
- Painful
- Pallor
- Pulseless
- Paraesthesia
- Paralysis
- Poikilothermia

#### Complications
- Bacterial infections & systemic sepsis
- Gangrene
- Peripheral nerve damage
- Amputation

### Investigations

#### Bedside Investigations
1. **Capillary Refill Time:** Prolonged > 2 seconds indicates insufficiency.
2. **Buerger Test:** Pale leg upon elevation, delayed color return indicates arterial insufficiency.
3. **Ankle Brachial Pulse Index (ABPI):** 
   - ABPI < 0.9: Peripheral Arterial Disease.
   - ABPI < 0.5: Critical Limb Ischemia.
   - ABPI < 0.3: Likely ulceration/gangrene.
4. **Urine Dipstick:** Assess for glycosuria.
5. **Swabs:** Assess for infection.
6. **ECG:** Check for [[msra/Cardiovascular/Atrial Fibrillation|atrial fibrillation]].

#### Blood Tests
1. FBC: Detect anemia.
2. HbA1c: Diabetes management.
3. Lipid Levels: HDL & LDL.
4. ESR: Inflammatory causes.
5. U&Es: Renal function.
6. Auto-antibodies: RA & SLE.

#### Imaging
- 1st line: Duplex Ultrasound.
- 2nd line: MRA Angiography (assess tissue viability).

#### Biopsy
- If malignancy is suspected.

### Management (Prescribing)

#### Pharmacological
- **Cause Management:** Target PAD or Diabetes.
- **Cardiovascular Risk Factors:** Modification required.
- **Anti-platelet Therapy.**

#### Specific Treatments
1. **Vasodilator Therapy:**
   - Naftidrofuryl Oxalate: 1st line for claudication.
   - Cilostazol: Not recommended due to lack of evidence.

2. **Pain Management:** 
   - Paracetamol or opioids.

3. **Cardiovascular Risk Factors:**
   - Lipid-Lowering Therapy: Atorvastatin target < 1.8 mmol/L.
   - Anti-hypertensive Therapy: ACE inhibitors; Beta-blockers are safe.
   - Diabetic Control: Adjust based on T1/T2DM.

4. **Anti-Platelet Therapy:**
   - Clopidogrel: 1st line for PAD.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Wound Management:** Debridement; topical antiseptics not recommended.
- **Exercise Training:** 2 hours weekly for claudication patients.
- **Revascularisation:** Angioplasty or bypass grafting.
- **Amputation:** Considered as a last resort.

#### Targeting the Ulcer
- Skin grafts/flaps might be considered but may not always be viable.
