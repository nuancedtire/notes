## Bowen's Disease Overview

- **Also Known As:** Squamous cell carcinoma in situ
- **Characteristics:** 
  - Scaly, pruritic, erythematous plaque
  - Slow progression; ~5% may progress to SCC
  - Confined to the epidermis (distinguishing from SCC)

- **Prognosis:** Excellent with treatment

## Diagnosis

- **Method:** Histological diagnosis necessary to differentiate from SCC
- **Risk Factors:**
  - Fair skin
  - Sun exposure
  - Immunosuppressive treatment
  - HPV infection
  - Arsenic exposure
- **Examination:** 
  - Full skin examination, especially legs
- **Presentation Features:**
  - Flesh-colored patch
  - Dry, scaly texture
  - Crusting and bleeding
  - Possible pigmentation
  - Slow growth

## Investigations

- **Skin Biopsy:** 
  - Confirm diagnosis; excision biopsy preferred to remove lesions
- **Histological Features:**
  - Atypical keratinocytes (full-thickness atypia)
  - Loss of polarity
  - Multinucleate keratinocytes
  - Intact basement membrane

## Management

### Prescribing

- **Topical Treatments:**
  - Fluorouracil
  - Imiquimod (first-line for difficult surgical cases)

### Non-Prescribing

- **Treatment Considerations:**
  - Dependent on size, location, thickness of lesion, and patient's health
- **Available Treatments:**
  - **Cryotherapy:** 
    - Liquid nitrogen to freeze plaque; healthy tissue left behind.
  - **Curettage with Cautery:** 
    - Scraping lesion + electrocautery; repeated as necessary, may leave hypopigmented scar.
  - **Photodynamic Therapy:** 
    - Photosensitising drug + light exposure; kills tumor cells, less routinely available.
  - **Conventional Surgery/Mohs Surgery:** 
    - Second-line therapies; Mohs for cosmetically sensitive areas if first-line fails.
  - **Radiotherapy:** 
    - For multiple lesions or patients unfit for surgery.
