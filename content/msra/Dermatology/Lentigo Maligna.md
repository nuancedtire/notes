Lentigo maligna is a precursor and early form of lentigo maligna melanoma characterized by atypical proliferation of melanocytes confined to the epidermis, often referred to as melanoma in situ. It commonly occurs in sun-damaged areas on the face or neck.

### Key Points
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Total UV exposure (common in outdoor workers)
  - Age (middle-aged and elderly patients)
  - Increased number of melanocytic nevi
  - Fair skin
  - History of severe sunburn
- **Progression**: Lentigo maligna can remain for up to 15 years before invading beyond the epidermis, with an estimated lifetime risk of developing lentigo maligna melanoma at ~5%.

### Diagnosis
- **Physical Examination**:
  - Focus on skin and lymph nodes.
  - Inspect existing moles and new pigmented lesions using the A-E rule for melanoma:
    - A - Asymmetry
    - B - Border irregularity
    - C - Colour irregularity
    - D - Diameter >6mm
    - E - Enlargement
- **Characteristics**:
  - Often >6mm in size
  - Irregular shape and variable pigmentation (brown, pink, red, or white)
  - Smooth surface resembling ink on skin

### Investigations
- **Dermoscopy**: First-line investigation but can be challenging to differentiate pigmented lesions.
- **Biopsy**: Full-thickness punch biopsy or excisional biopsy for smaller lesions.
- **Staging**: TNM system, with lentigo melanoma classified as Tis (melanoma in situ).

### Management (Non-prescribing)
- **Surgical Treatment**: First-line is surgical excision with narrow margins (0.5-1 cm), considering staged margin excisions for higher cure rates. 
- **Non-surgical Options**:
  - **Cryotherapy**: Low temperatures destroy melanocytes; not standard management.
  - **Topical Imiquimod Cream**: Requires regular application; potential for recurrence.
  - **Radiation Therapy**: Needs accurate mapping of the tumor.
