Atopic eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition prevalent in all ages, especially in children under 5. It is characterized by skin barrier dysfunction, affecting up to 25% of school children and 2-10% of adults. Atopic eczema often coexists with other atopic diseases, including allergic rhinitis, food allergies, and asthma. Patients typically experience crusting, itchiness, and skin peeling, significantly impacting mental health and quality of life.

### Diagnosis

Diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on history and physical examination.

#### History
- Onset is commonly between 6 months and 5 years.
- Patients may have a history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, or food allergies.

#### Symptoms
- Dry, scaly skin patches
- Pruritus (itching)
- Lichenification (accentuation of skin lines)
- Excoriation (skin damage from itching)

Secondary changes, such as lichenification and excoriation, arise from excessive itching.

#### Risk Factors
- Family history of atopic diseases (allergic rhinitis, food allergies, asthma, atopic eczema)
- Environmental factors (high pollution, extreme weather)
- Exposure to second-hand smoke
- High birth weight

Atopic eczema can occur without known risk factors, so diagnosis should not be dismissed based on their absence.

### Investigations

Investigations are not necessary for diagnosis but may aid in confirmation.

- **Allergy testing:** Useful for identifying specific allergies and allergens to avoid.
- **Elevated blood IgE levels:** Common but does not influence treatment.
- **Skin biopsy:** May be performed if diagnosis remains uncertain, to rule out conditions like cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

### Management (Prescribing)

Management includes medications for acute flare-ups and chronic disease control.

- **Emollients:** Essential for both acute and chronic phases. They are not sufficient alone for flare-up treatment.
- **Topical corticosteroids:** Low to medium strength can be prescribed by GPs. Stronger corticosteroids may be needed for serious flare-ups and prescribed by dermatologists (secondary care), starting with the lowest strength.
  
For chronic management, combine emollients with topical steroids. Educate on proper use and duration due to potential side effects.

For resistant eczema, consider alternative therapies:
- **UV light therapy**
- **Systemic immunosuppressive drugs** (e.g., ciclosporin), prescribed by a dermatologist in secondary care.
