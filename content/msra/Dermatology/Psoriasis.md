Psoriasis Overview  
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and inflammatory cell infiltration, leading to defined red and scaly plaques on the skin.

### Pathophysiology
- **Genetic Factors**: Related to HLA-B13, HLA-B17, and HLA-C*06:02.  
- **Immunological Factors**: Involves abnormal T cell activity; cytokines like IL1β and TNF⍺; current theories focus on TH17 pathway and IL17A release.  
- **Environmental Factors**: Exacerbating factors include skin trauma (Köebner phenomenon), infections (e.g., tonsillitis), and improvement from sunlight exposure.

### Exacerbating Factors
- Medications: β-blockers, lithium, antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, infliximab, systemic steroid withdrawal.  
- Lifestyle: Alcohol consumption and stress.

### Complications
- Psoriatic Arthropathy (10% of cases): 
  - Symmetrical polyarthritis 
  - Asymmetrical oligomonoarthritis 
  - Lone distal interphalangeal disease 
  - Psoriatic spondylosis 
  - Arthritis mutilans (1-5% cases, leading to joint deformities)
- Additional: Metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism, psychological/social stress.

### Diagnosis
- Affects 2-4% of the UK population; onset at any age, peaks at 15-25 years and 50-60 years.
- Features:
  - Well-demarcated, scaly plaques; can be itchy/painful. 
  - Common on extensor surfaces and scalp.
  - **Auspitz sign**: Capillary bleeding with scale removal.
  - Nail changes in 50% of cases.

### Subtypes of Psoriasis
1. **Chronic Plaque Psoriasis**: The most common, persistent >3cm plaques, affects extensor surfaces, lower back, and scalp.  
2. **Small Plaque Psoriasis**: Late age onset, plaques <3cm.  
3. **Unstable Plaque Psoriasis**: Rapid plaque extension, mostly due to infections/stress.  
4. **Flexural Psoriasis**: Smooth patches in body folds; colonized by Candida.  
5. **Seborrhoeic Psoriasis**: Overlap with seborrhoeic dermatitis; affects face, scalp.  
6. **Guttate Psoriasis**: Teardrop papules, often post-Streptococcal infection; resolves in 2-3 months.  
7. **Pustular Psoriasis**: Primarily on palms and soles.  
8. **Nail Psoriasis**: Nail pitting, onycholysis, associated with inflammatory arthritis.  
9. **Erythrodermic Psoriasis**: Total body redness; can lead to systemic issues.

### Investigations
- Diagnosis primarily clinical; may require skin biopsy.
- Assess for:
  1. Disease severity
  2. Physical/psychological/social well-being
  3. Psoriatic arthritis presence
  4. Comorbidities

### Evaluation Tools for Severity
- Physician's Global Assessment
- Patient's Global Assessment
- Body Surface Area (BSA)
- Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)
- Nail Psoriasis Severity Index 

### Evaluation Tools for Quality of Life
- Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) for adults
- Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) for children

### Monitoring for Comorbidities
- Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST)
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Vital signs (blood pressure, ECG)
- Blood tests (glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile)

### Management
#### General Advice
- Avoid triggers (smoking, excessive alcohol), maintain optimal weight, use emollients.

#### Treatment Guidelines
- **First-line**: Topical therapy.
- **Second/Third-line**: Phototherapy/systemic therapy if inadequate control from topical alone.

#### Specific Treatments
- **For trunk/limbs**:
  - First: Potent topical corticosteroids + vitamin D analogues (4 weeks).
  - Second: Twice daily vitamin D analogues if no improvement.
  - Third: Potent corticosteroid or coal tar preparations if still no improvement.

- **Scalp**: Same as trunk/limbs with special formulations for scalp.
- **Face/Flexural**: Mild/moderate corticosteroids for 2 weeks.

#### Secondary Care Management
- **Extensive Disease**:
  - Phototherapy (UVB three times a week).
  - PUVA therapy with topical agents.
  
- **Severe Disease**:
  - Oral methotrexate as first-line; alternatives include ciclosporin, systemic retinoids.
  - Avoid systemic corticosteroids.

- **Conventional Treatment-Resistant**:
  - Biologic agents (anti-TNFα, IL-12, IL-23 antagonists), side effects generally manageable but costly.

#### Side Effects
- Topical corticosteroids: skin atrophy, striae, rebound symptoms; limit use duration.
- Vitamin D analogues reduce cell division; can be used long-term.
