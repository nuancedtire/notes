## Athlete's Foot (Tinea Pedis)

### Overview
- **Definition**: Common fungal infection of feet/toes.
- **Causes**: Mostly dermatophytes from **_Trichophyton_** genus.
- **Symptoms**: Itchy, painful feet. 

### Subtypes
1. **Interdigital Type**: 
   - Characteristics: White/red, itchy, scaly, fissured skin between toes.
2. **Moccasin Type**: 
   - Characteristics: Scaling and erythema on plantar/lateral surfaces.
3. **Vesicobullous Type**: 
   - Characteristics: Blisters on arches.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Signs**: 
   - Interdigital scaling and fissures.
   - Moccasin scaling and erythema.
   - Arch blisters.
- **Differential Diagnosis Considerations**: 
   - Incorrectly diagnosing athleteâ€™s foot as contact/allergic dermatitis can lead to iatrogenic harm (e.g., **tinea incognito**).

### Investigations
- **When to Use Skin Sampling for Fungal Microscopy/Culture**: 
   1. Severe disease.
   2. Diagnostic uncertainty.
   3. Persistent infection despite treatment.
- **Skin Swabs**: Recommended if secondary bacterial infection is suspected.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Topical Antifungals**: 
   - First-line: Topical imidazoles or terbinafine for all patients.
- **Steroids**: 
   - Mild potency topical steroids for marked inflammation.
- **Oral Antifungals**: 
   - Reserved for severe tinea pedis or concurrent infections.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Self-Care Strategies**: 
   - Change socks frequently.
   - Meticulously dry feet and toes.
   - Avoid occlusive footwear.
   - Wear protective footwear in communal areas.
