Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma (KS) is a low-grade neoplasm associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). Features and characteristics include:

- **Origin**: Vascular system; consists of vasoformative tumor cells, abnormal vessels, and chronic inflammatory cells.

### Subtypes of KS

1. **Epidemic AIDS-related**: Occurs in HIV-positive individuals; incidence reduced by antiretroviral therapy (ART), but remains high in sub-Saharan Africa.
2. **Classic sporadic KS**: Unrelated to HIV; more common in older men of Jewish or Mediterranean descent.
3. **Iatrogenic or transplant-associated**: Related to immunosuppressants, often post- solid organ transplantation.
4. **African endemic**: Unrelated to HIV; found in central Africa.

### Lesion Characteristics

- Location: Mucocutaneous sites
- Progresses from patches to plaques to ulcerating tumor nodules
- Can spread to lymph nodes and visceral organs

### Treatment Goals

- Symptom palliation
- Disease progression prevention
- Cosmetic improvement

**Prognosis**: Poorer for patients with severe illness and systemic involvement. Excision typically reserved for cosmetic concerns or discomfort.

### Diagnosis

- Identification and clinical classification
- Confirmation via biopsy and histopathology
- Asymptomatic cutaneous lesions, non-painful, may appear as pink-purple nodules or purple-brown plaques
- Physical examination of frequently affected areas: lower limbs, face, oral mucosa, and genitalia

### Investigation

- **HIV Testing**: Mandatory for KS patients; CD4 count and viral load for those already HIV positive
- **Biopsy**: Punch biopsy of suspect lesions to identify atypical spindle-shaped cells
- **Additional Tests**: Fecal occult blood test for GI involvement, chest X-ray for pleural effusions, lymphadenopathy, or nodules.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **ART Initiation**: Recommended regardless of CD4 count for AIDS-related KS.
- **Surgical Excision**: For cosmetically unappealing lesions causing discomfort or to control growth.
- **Alternative Therapies**: Laser, cryotherapy, external beam radiation, topical therapies (imiquimod, aliretinoin).
- **Systemic Treatment**: For widespread skin involvement, significant symptoms, or visceral disease, with liposomal anthracyclines as first-line treatment.

### Notes

- Radiotherapy may be used for patients who cannot tolerate chemotherapy.
