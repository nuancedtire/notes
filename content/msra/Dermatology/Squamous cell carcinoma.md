Skin cancers are the most common malignancy in the UK, with around 70,000 cases annually, although many go unreported. They can be categorized into:

- **Melanoma** (~10%)
- **Non-Melanoma Skin Cancers (NMSC)** (~90%)
  - **Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)**: ~23% of NMSC
  - **Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)**: Most common skin cancer

### Diagnosis
- SCC presents as:
  - Warty tumors on a fleshy base
  - Persistently scaly or crusty irregular lesions
  - Areas of inflammation that may ulcerate or bleed
- Commonly occurs on sun-exposed skin (ears, neck, head, hands) but can appear anywhere, including the genital area.
- Diagnosis involves clinical judgment and confirmation through further investigation.

### Risk Factors
- **Primary**: Excessive UV exposure (causing DNA damage)
- **Pre-cancerous Conditions**:
  - Actinic keratoses
  - Bowenâ€™s disease
- **Other Risk Factors**:
  - Chronic inflammation (burns, chronic ulcers)
  - Immunosuppression (autoimmune conditions, organ transplants, HIV)
  - Genetic conditions (xeroderma pigmentosum, albinism)
  - Human papillomavirus

### Investigations
- Referral to dermatologist for suspected SCC.
- Diagnosis confirmed via biopsy:
  - Excision biopsy for small lesions
  - Incision/punch biopsy for larger lesions
- Histology results typically available within 7-10 days.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **First-line treatment**: Surgical excision.
- **Pre-cancerous conditions medications**:
  - 5-Fluorouracil cream (Efudix)
  - Diclofenac gel 3%
  - Imiquimod (Aldara)
- Treatment choice may depend on patient preference.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Surgical options:
  - **Surgical excision**: Most common
  - **Mohs micrographic surgery**: For high-risk patients
- Other treatments:
  - Curettage and cautery: Shallow tumours/in situ
  - Cryotherapy: Small, shallow, in situ SCCs
  - Radiotherapy: For frail elderly or non-resectable tumours
- **Prevention**: Essential to maintain sun protection.

### Follow-Up
- Patients should monitor scars for recurrence.
- Follow-up intervals:
  - Low-risk: every 3 months; discharge if no recurrence.
  - High-risk: at least 2 years, every 3 months.
- Patients should be educated on warning signs and when to seek medical advice.
