## Lichen Planus Overview

- **Prevalence**: Affects ~1 in 100 people globally; most common in adults aged 30-60.
- **Nature**: Itchy, non-contagious chronic inflammatory disease affecting skin, hair, nails, and mucous membranes.

### Symptoms

- **Rash Characteristics**: 
  - Itchy, shiny, flat-topped purple papules/plaque.
  - Caused by activated T-lymphocytes leading to keratinocyte apoptosis.
- **Potential Triggers**: 
  - Autoimmune response, hepatitis C infection, and certain medications (e.g., anti-malarials, NSAIDs, thiazide diuretics).
  
### Complications

- **Erosive Oral/Genital Lichen Planus**: Requires monitoring due to squamous cell carcinoma risk.
- **Scalp Involvement**: May lead to scarring alopecia.
- **Chronic Cases**: Possible recurrence after treatment; focus on symptom control.

### Resolution

- **Eruptions**: 
  - ~50% resolve in 6 months; ~85% resolve in 18 months.
  - Oral lichen planus may persist for an average of 5 years.

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical Assessment**: Based on history and examination.
- **Risk Factors**: Include hepatitis C, psychosocial stress, contact allergies, and new medications.
- **Common Lesion Locations**: Wrists, ankles, trunk, extremities (cutaneous); painful erosions in oral/genital areas.

### Lesion Characteristics

- **Skin**: 
  - Pruritic, violaceous, polygonal papules/plaques, may have Wickhamâ€™s striae.
- **Oral/Genital**: 
  - White striae, purple plaques/papules, erosions.
- **Nail Changes**: Thinning, longitudinal ridging.
- **Other Variations**: Hypertrophic, erosive/ulcerative, follicular, and annular lichen planus.

## Investigations

- **Diagnosis**: Primarily clinical; consider investigations if needed.
- **Histopathology**: Punch biopsy to identify lymphocytic infiltrate, necrotic keratinocytes, hyperkeratosis, and hypergranulosis.
- **Direct Immunofluorescent Staining**: May reveal immunoglobulin deposits.
- **Patch Testing**: For oral LP with amalgam fillings.
- **Hepatitis C Testing**: If suspected.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Mild Cases**: Potent topical corticosteroids.
- **Hypertrophic Lesions**: Intralesional corticosteroids.
- **Severe Cases**: Oral corticosteroids; taper over 2-6 weeks.
- **Recurrence**: Systemic corticosteroids may be used.
- **Other Treatments**: 
  - Topical/oral retinoids if steroids ineffective.
  - Antihistamines for itch relief.
  - Treat ulcerative oral LP with topical corticosteroids.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Asymptomatic Oral LP**: No treatment needed.
- **Symptomatic Cases**: Barrier agents, topical anaesthetic mouth rinses (e.g., benzydamine), topical corticosteroids.
- **Widespread LP**: May benefit from UV-B therapy; PUVA therapy (carcinogenic) may also be used with corticosteroids.
