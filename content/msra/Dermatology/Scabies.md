Scabies is a contagious skin disease caused by the parasitic mite _Sarcoptes scabiei_. The condition is characterized by a very itchy rash due to the mite burrowing into the skin, primarily laying eggs in the stratum corneum. It spreads through skin-to-skin contact, sexual transmission, or contaminated furnishings and bedding.

### Diagnosis

**Commonly Affected Groups:**
- Children, young adults, and the elderly.

**Symptoms:**
- Linear burrows or rubbery nodules
- Widespread pruritus (worse at night, can persist for 4-6 weeks post-eradication)
- Common sites: finger webs, sides of fingers, wrists, elbows, ankles, feet, nipples, genitals (face and scalp may be affected in infants).

**Risk Factors:**
- Poverty and overcrowding
- Refugee camps
- Institutional care (rest homes, hospitals, prisons)
- Immunodeficient or immunosuppressed individuals

**Diagnostic Criteria (IACS 2018):**
- **Confirmed Scabies (A):**
  - A1: Mites, eggs, or faeces on light microscopy
  - A2: Visualisation with high-powered imaging
  - A3: Mites visualised using dermatoscopy
- **Clinical Scabies (B):**
  - B1: Scabies burrows
  - B2: Typical lesions in male genitalia
  - B3: Typical lesions with two history features
- **Suspected Scabies (C):**
  - C1: Typical lesions with one history feature
  - C2: Atypical lesions with two history features

**History Features:**
- H1: Itch
- H2: Close contact with affected individual

### Complications

**Secondary Infection:**
- Result from scratching, leading to bacterial infections like impetigo or cellulitis. Can lead to serious conditions such as sepsis, acute rheumatic fever, and post-streptococcus glomerulonephritis.

**Crusted (Norwegian) Scabies:**
- Highly contagious, seen in immunosuppressed patients (e.g., HIV). Presents with a scaly rash, itch may be minimal. Treatment involves oral ivermectin and topical scabicide.

**Other Risk Factors for Crusted Scabies:**
- Old age
- Malnutrition
- Neurological diseases
- Intellectual deficits

### Investigation

Confirmed through:
- **Dermatoscopy:** May show a unique appearance of the mite
- **Skin scrape:** Mites viewed under a microscope
- **Skin biopsy:** May reveal scabies histopathology (often non-specific).

### Management (Prescribing)

**First-line Treatment:**
- Topical permethrin 5% cream

**Second-line Treatment:**
- Topical malathion 0.5% cream

**Oral Antibiotics:**
- Required for secondary infections.

**Application Guidance:**
- Apply to the whole body, focusing on common areas. Allow to dry and remain on skin for 8-12 hours (permethrin) or 24 hours (malathion) before washing. Repeat treatment in 8-10 days to catch newly hatched mites.

**Alternative Treatments:**
- 25% benzyl benzoate lotion (not for children)
- 2-10% precipitated sulphur ointment
- Crotamiton cream (weak scabicide).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

**Guidelines:**
- Treat all close contacts simultaneously, even if asymptomatic.
- Avoid close contact until treatment completion.
- Launder and dry clothing, bedding to kill mites. Non-washable items should be sealed for at least a week.
- Thoroughly clean living spaces, vacuum carpets and upholstery; specialized cleaning not required.
