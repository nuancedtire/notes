Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS)

**Overview**
- Acute mucocutaneous reaction affecting skin, mucous membranes, digestive tract, genitals, and eyes.
- Can lead to multiorgan failure and has characterized by epidermal loss and multisite mucositis.
- SJS and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) are variants within the same condition. 
  - SJS: <10% body surface area
  - TEN: >30% body surface area
- Erythema Multiforme (EMM) is less severe, often infection-related (especially herpes), and rarely medication-induced.
- Incidence: ~1-2 cases per million per year; mortality <10%; significant long-term sequelae in survivors.

**Causes**
- **Children**: Often viral infections (mumps, flu, herpes simplex, coxsackie virus, Epstein-Barr); less commonly bacterial.
- **Adults**: Unpredictable reactions to medications, including:
  - Allopurinol
  - Carbamazepine
  - Lamotrigine
  - Nevirapine
  - Oxicam class NSAIDs
  - Phenobarbital 
  - Phenytoin
  - Sulfa antibiotics
  - Sertraline
  - Sulfasalazine
- Consider infective causes (e.g., mycoplasma) when no drug is identified.

**Risk Factors**
- Viral infections (e.g., herpes, hepatitis).
- Immunocompromised (HIV/AIDS, autoimmune conditions, chemotherapy).
- Previous SJS history.
- Family history of SJS.
- Genetic predisposition (e.g., HLA-B1502, HLA-B1508).

**Diagnosis**
- **Clinical Features**: Prodromal flu-like symptoms, then skin eruption.
  - Initial malaise, high fever, headache, joint pain, cough.
  - Ocular inflammation may precede skin lesions.
- **Skin Presentation Stages**:
  - Early cutaneous pain, atypical targets, purpuric macules.
  - Rash spreads over hours/days, major areas of confluent erythema can form.
  - Blistering and epidermis detachment lead to ulcerative mucositis.
  - Complications may include painful sores, odynophagia, dysphagia, dehydration.

**Complications**
- **Cutaneous**: Uneven skin color, rare scarring, secondary cellulitis.
- **Extracutaneous**: Respiratory issues, myocarditis, acute kidney injury, mild hepatitis, digestive issues, ocular damage, reproductive organ complications.

**Emergency Diagnosis and Management**
- Urgent referral to dermatologist and potential hospitalization (ICU, burns unit).
- Diagnosis based on symptoms, medication history, and physical exam.
- **Clinical Signs**: Tender lesions, target lesions, Nikolsky sign.

**Initial Management Plan**
- Discontinue suspected culprit drug(s).
- Establish IV access, start fluid resuscitation, monitor hydration/nutrition.
- Estimate body surface area affected using Lund and Browder chart.

**Investigations**
- Blood tests (CBC, ESR, CRP, U&Es, liver function, etc.), chest X-ray.
- Lesional skin swabs, skin biopsies for diagnosis confirmation.

**Management (Prescribing)**
- Pain management, mouthwashes, corticosteroids (on specialist advice), systemic antibiotics, eye drops, wound cleansing, emollient application.

**Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- Multi-disciplinary team approach.
- Prevent nosocomial infections through controlled environment.
- Care for detached epidermis and blisters.

**Prevention**
- Avoid culprit medications for life, inform family of genetic risks.
- Monitor for SJS symptoms in high-risk patients.
- Consider genetic testing for predisposition to medication reactions.
