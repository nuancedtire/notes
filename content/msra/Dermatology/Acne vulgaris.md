## Acne Vulgaris Overview

- **Definition**: Common inflammatory disease causing chronic pustular rash.
- **Common Areas**: Face, neck, chest, back.
- **Prevalence**: Most teenagers affected; only a minority need medical treatment.
- **Management Pathway**: Step-up approach from topical to oral medications.

### Diagnosis

- **Mechanism**: Obstruction of pilosebaceous units (hair follicles + sebaceous gland).
- **Classification**: 
  - **Mild**: Few comedones + inflammatory lesions.
  - **Moderate**: Extensive comedones + widespread inflammatory lesions.
  - **Severe**: Extensive inflammatory lesions (nodules, cysts).

|                             | Pustules                 | Moderate or Severe          |

### Investigations

- **Routine**: Most patients do not need further investigation.
- **When to Investigate**: Severe, refractory cases may indicate secondary causes such as:
  - PCOS
  - Pituitary adenomas
  - Anabolic steroid use
- **Children with Virilisation**: Measure serum androgen levels.

### Management (Prescribing)

#### First-line Treatment
- **Topical benzoyl peroxide**; step up based on response.
