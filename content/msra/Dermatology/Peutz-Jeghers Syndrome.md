Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominant condition marked by:

- Benign hamartomatous polyps in the GI tract
- Mucocutaneous pigmentation
- Caused by mutations in the STK11 tumor suppressor gene

### Pathophysiology
- Mutations lead to rapid division of GI cells and polyp formation.
- Complications: obstruction, ulceration, GI bleeding. 
- Increased risk for bowel and other cancers (pancreas, breast, ovaries, testicles) â€” ~93% lifetime cancer risk.

### Diagnosis
- Often asymptomatic; small bowel obstruction in ~50% of cases.
- Symptoms typically develop between ages 10-30, including:
  - Abdominal pain
  - Haematochezia
  - Intussusception
  - Anaemia
  - Prolapse of anal polyps
- Mucocutaneous pigmentation: found on buccal mucosa, lips, fingers, etc. Present in 95% of patients.

### WHO Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnosis requires at least one of the following:
- Three or more confirmed polyps
- Any number of polyps with a family history of PJS
- Mucocutaneous pigmentation with family history of PJS
- Any number of polyps and characteristic pigmentation

### Investigations
- **First-line:** Endoscopy (OGD, capsule endoscopy, colonoscopy)
- Polyps seen in 88% of patients by age 10.
- Polyp types: small intestinal polyposis (75% of patients), sessile/pedunculated hamartomatous polyps.
- Biopsy for histology and genetic testing; germline testing for STK11 mutations.

### Management
#### Pharmacological
- No routine pharmacological prophylaxis; experimental agents in trials.

#### Non-prescribing
**Routine Surveillance:**
- Begin at age 10:
  - Upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy start at age 12:
    - Annually if polyps present.
    - Every 2-3 years if no polyps.
  - MRCP/ultrasound at age 25; every 1-2 years.
  - Breast self-exam at 18, MRI annually from 25-50, then mammography.
  - Yearly transvaginal ultrasound starting at 25; cervical smear every 2-3 years.
  - Annual testicular exam starting at 12.

**Prevention:**
- Polyps removal via endoscopy or balloon enteroscopy if symptomatic.
- Colectomy in cases of rapid polyp growth or high-risk characteristics.

**Mucocutaneous Pigmentation:**
- Treatment options include laser or light therapy for significant cosmetic concerns.
