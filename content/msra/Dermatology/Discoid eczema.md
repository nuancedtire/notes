Discoid eczema is a type of dermatitis with the following characteristics:

- **Plaque Appearance**: Well-demarcated, coin-shaped plaques.
- **Age Group**: Affects any age, more common in adult males, especially men over 50 with chronic alcoholism.
- **Location**: Usually on upper/lower limbs, widespread, bilateral but asymmetrical.

### Causes
Unknown, but may be triggered by:
- Localised injury (e.g., insect bites, scratches)
- Impetigo
- Contact dermatitis
- Dry skin
- Varicose veins

### Symptoms
- Itchy, red patches that start as small spots with bumps.
- Patches enlarge into swollen, round lesions (1-3 cm or larger).
- Can weep or crust over.
- May have a golden crust indicating secondary infection.

### Diagnosis
- **Characteristic Appearance**: Identified by round, itchy patches.
- **Investigations to Rule Out Other Conditions**:
  - Bacterial swabs for staphylococcus aureus.
  - Scrapings for mycology to rule out tinea corporis.
  - Patch testing for contact allergy (often no specific allergy identified).

### Management
- **Topical Treatments**: 
  - Potent corticosteroids (e.g., beclomethasone dipropionate, hydrocortisone butyrate) to control inflammation.
  - Combination creams with steroids and antibiotics or antiseptics.
  - Tacrolimus ointment for inflammation.
- **Emollients**: Regular use to address dryness and scaling, continued after clearing.
- **Oral Steroids**: Rarely needed for severe cases.
- **Immunosuppressants**: For persistent cases (e.g., methotrexate, ciclosporin, azathioprine).

### Duration
Can last months to years if untreated; clinical course fluctuates, with patches potentially healing without scarring but leaving dark marks.
