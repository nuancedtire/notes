Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is the most common inflammatory skin disease in the UK, often presenting in early childhood with itchy patches, erythema, and scale. While most cases improve by adulthood, some may persist into adulthood. Management involves general measures (emollients, trigger avoidance) and treatment of flare-ups with topical steroids.

### Diagnosis

Diagnosis and severity classification is based on history and examination. Key indicators include:

- **Itchy skin (invariably present)**
- **Acute lesions:** Erythematous, vesicular, or exudative skin.
- **Chronic lesions:** Excoriated or lichenified skin.
- **Flexor surface involvement:** Inside elbows, behind knees; or cheeks/extensor surfaces in infants.
- **History of eczema or dry skin.**
- **Family history of atopy:** Asthma or allergic rhinitis.

### Severity Assessment

| Itch | Acute lesions | Chronic lesions |
|---|---|---|
| **Clear** | - | - |
| **Mild** | Infrequent | Dry, limited erythema |
| **Moderate** | Frequent | Dry, erythema; excoriations, local skin thickening |
| **Severe** | Incessant | Extensive dry, erythema; oozing, cracking; excoriations, extensive thickening |
| **Infected** | Worsening | Weeping, crusting, pustules; systemically unwell |

### Investigations

Most patients do not require investigations. Allergy testing is only indicated if allergens are suspected to cause eczema flares or if it is refractory despite optimal management.

### Management (Prescribing)

Topical corticosteroids are applied according to a steroid ladder:

| Potency | Examples | Use | Eczema severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mild** | Hydrocortisone 0.1-2.5% | Delicate, thin areas of skin | Mild |
| **Moderate** | Clobetasone (Eumovate速) | | Moderate |
| **Potent** | Betamethasone (Betnovate速, Diprosone速) | Body, hands & feet | Severe |
| **Very Potent** | Clobetasol propionate (Dermovate速) | Specialists | |

Other treatments:

- **Oral corticosteroids:** Short course for severe/extensive eczema.
- **Steroid-sparing agents:** Topical immunomodulators (tacrolimus, pimecrolimus).
- **Antihistamines:** For severe itch or urticaria.
- **Antibiotics/antivirals:** For secondary infections.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

Provide general advice to maintain skin barrier function, such as identifying and avoiding exacerbating agents and using emollients, bandaging, and soap substitutes.
