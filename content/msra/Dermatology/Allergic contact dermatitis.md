- **Contact Dermatitis**: Inflammatory skin disease
  - **Types**: 
    - Irritant contact dermatitis (80%)
    - Allergic contact dermatitis (20%)
      - Caused by various allergens
      - Delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction after re-exposure
  - **Prognosis & Management**: Depends on identifying and avoiding allergens

### **Diagnosis**
- **Lesions**: 
  - Acute lesions develop 2-3 days post-re-exposure 
  - Symptoms: Itchy, erythematous, weepy (due to vesiculation)
  - Chronic exposure may cause dry, fissured, or lichenified skin
- **History & Examination**: 
  - Diagnosis typically based on history and skin examination
  - Locations linked to specific allergens (e.g., cosmetics for face/scalp)

### **Investigations**
- **Patch Testing**: 
  - Identifies causing allergens
  - Differentiates allergic dermatitis from irritant dermatitis
- **Additional Tests**: 
  - Skin swabs/biopsies if diagnosis is unclear or infection is a concern

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- **Self-Limiting**: Resolves days to weeks with avoidance of triggers
- **Advice**:
  - Minimize exposure when avoidance is difficult
  - Use emollients and soap substitutes liberally

### **Management (Prescribing)**
- **Topical Steroids**: 
  - For symptom control based on steroid ladder
