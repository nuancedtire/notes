- **Definition**
  - Melanoma: malignant neoplasm of melanocytes.
  - Rising incidence; highest mortality among skin neoplasms.

- **Subtypes**
  1. **Superficial Spreading Melanoma**: plaque with irregular borders, variegated color.
  2. **Lentigo Maligna Melanoma**: gradually enlarges tan/brown macule to papule/nodule.
  3. **Acral Lentiginous Melanoma**: arises on palms, soles, subungual, mucosal surfaces.
  4. **Nodular Melanoma**: darkly pigmented nodule, may be ulcerated.
  
- **Rare Variants**: nevoid melanoma, desmoplastic melanoma, solitary dermal melanoma.

- **Origins**
  - Majority arise de novo; some from dysplastic/congenital melanocytic naevi.

- **Risk Factors**
  - **Genetic**: Family history of melanoma/dysplastic naevi.
  - **Environmental**: UV exposure, history of sunburns.
  - **Phenotypic**:
    - Skin types I and II (light/fair-skinned).
    - >50 common naevi.
    - Atypical/dysplastic/congenital naevi.
    - Personal history of melanoma.

- **Signs of Malignancy (ABCDE)**
  - **A**symmetry in shape.
  - **B**order irregularity.
  - **C**olor variegated/mottled.
  - **D**iameter ≥6mm.
  - **E**levation/irregularity or evolution (enlarging, ulceration, bleeding).

- **"Ugly Duckling" Sign**: lesion looks different from surrounding lesions; raises suspicion.

- **Disease Spread**
  - Sequence: primary melanoma → regional metastases → distant metastases.
  - Regional metastases: dermal nodule/plaque near primary tumor.
  - Distant metastases: common in lungs, liver, brain, bone, intestines.

- **Differential Diagnosis**
  - **Benign**: Common melanocytic naevus, atypical naevus, blue naevus, lentigo, etc.
  - **Malignant/Pre-malignant**: Pigmented basal cell carcinoma, pigmented actinic keratosis.

- **Prognostic Features**
  - Tumor thickness (most important for localized melanoma).
  - Ulceration and mitotic rate.
  - Presence of metastases.

- **Diagnosis**
  - Biopsy required for diagnosis.
  - Histopathological assessment: architectural, cytologic, host response.

- **Investigations**
  - Referral to dermatologists recommended.
  - Experienced professionals for dermoscopy.

- **Management (Non-prescribing)**
  - **Curative Treatment**: Wide local excision with adequate margins.
    - Trunk/extremities: margins 0.5-2cm based on tumor thickness.
    - Head/neck: adjuvant radiation if high recurrence risk.
    - Controversial for subungual, palmar, plantar, mucous sites.
  - **Metastases**: Evaluate oligometastatic disease for possible metastasectomy and systemic therapy.

- **Recurrence**: Late recurrence common (>10 years); long-term follow-up necessary.

- **Primary Prevention**
  - Educate on sun protection: minimize exposure, protective clothing, sunscreen (SPF ≥30), avoid tanning beds.
  - Routine screening not recommended; annual screenings for high-risk patients.
