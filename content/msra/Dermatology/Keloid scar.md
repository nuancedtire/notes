A keloid is an abnormal scar tissue proliferation at an injury site. It is a benign dermal fibroproliferative tumor, meaning it has no malignant potential. Key features include:

- **Causes**: Develops in response to trauma or inflammation (e.g., acne, piercings, tattoos, vaccinations, surgery).
- **Age Group**: Most common in individuals aged 10-30, with limited occurrence after age 65.
- **Incidence**: Higher likelihood in darker skin pigmentation; familial tendency noted with identification of susceptibility loci on chromosomes.
- **Cell Characteristics**: Resistance to apoptosis in keloid fibroblasts contributes to its progression; stabilizes after proliferation.

### Psychological Impact
- Keloids can affect patients psychologically due to their unsightly appearance and risk of infection (e.g., abscess formation). Treatment is challenging, with variable patient responses and potential for relapse.

### Diagnosis
**Risk Factors**:
- History of keloid scarring
- Darker skin types
- Family history
- Trauma (keloids form as a repair response)

**Clinical Diagnosis**: 
- Generally, biopsy is not performed as it may exacerbate scarring.
- Symptoms may include itchiness or tingling during active growth.

**Common Locations**:
- Earlobes (e.g., from piercings), presternal region, deltoid area.
- Scarring is typically smooth, shiny, and larger than initial injury; may be erythematous during active phase.

### Management
**Preventive Measures**:
- Avoidance of further inciting events (e.g., piercings) and maintenance of skin hygiene.

**Treatment Options**:
1. **Silicone-Based Therapy**: Gel or sheets; may improve thickness and color with consistent use.
2. **Intralesional Corticosteroids Â± Lidocaine**: Steroids improve appearance while lidocaine reduces collagen production.
3. **Topical Corticosteroids**: Used for children or when injections are too painful.
4. **Laser Therapy**: Administered by specialists; evidence of effectiveness is poor.
5. **Cryotherapy**: Helps induce cell death without denaturing collagen.
6. **Pressure Therapy**: Elastic garments induce local tissue hypoxia.

**Surgical Options**: Considered as second-line treatment for those unresponsive to other methods. Surgery risks recurrence and should be approached with caution.
