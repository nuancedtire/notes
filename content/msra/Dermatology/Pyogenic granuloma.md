- **Definition**: Pyogenic granuloma (granuloma telangiectaticum) is a benign proliferation of capillary blood vessels on skin and mucosal surfaces; no malignant transformation reported.
  
- **Demographics**: Common in:
  - Children (mean age: 6-7 years)
  - Adults (linked to pregnancy, female gender, medications: OCP, retinoids, chemotherapeutic agents)

- **Presentation**:
  - Painless red spot 
  - Rapid growth (days to weeks) reaching 1-2 cm 
  - Location:
    - Mucosal surfaces (pregnancy-related)
    - Head, neck, extremities (especially fingers)
  - Potential for discomfort, profuse bleeding, or ulceration due to vascular nature.

### **Diagnosis**
- Typically straightforward:
  - Clinical course evaluation
  - Rule out malignancy, particularly amelanocytic melanoma
  - Use of dermatoscopy and detailed clinical history.

### **Investigations**
- Biopsy and histological analysis to exclude malignancy.

### **Management (non-prescribing)**
- **Conservative**:
  - Remove underlying cause (if drug-induced)
  - Watchful waiting (especially for small or pregnancy-related lesions)
  
- **Surgical Options**:
  - Excision, curettage, cauterization, laser surgery.
  
- **Other Treatments**:
  - Cryotherapy or chemical cauterization (e.g., silver nitrate for smaller lesions).
  - Imiquimod cream or topical 1% propranolol ointment for children.

- **Recurrence**: Common due to deep dermal vessel extension; requires surgical excision for best management.
