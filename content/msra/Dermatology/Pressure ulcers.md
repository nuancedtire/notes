## Pressure Ulcers Overview

- **Definition**: Damage to skin and underlying tissue caused by constant pressure, friction, and moisture.
- **Mechanism**: Constant pressure prevents normal blood flow, leading to ischaemia, localized cell death, and skin breakdown.

### Predisposing Factors
- Inability to move (illness, paralysis, age)
- Being bedridden or in a wheelchair
- Malnourishment and dehydration
- Weight loss (less padding over bony areas)
- Shearing (sliding down in bed/chair)
- Skin friction (against bedsheets)
- Moisture from sweating or incontinence
- Comorbidities (e.g., diabetes)
- Previous history of pressure ulcers

### Diagnosis
- Common sites: Heel, sacrum, elbows, hips.
- Development: Gradual or rapid (within hours).

#### Stages of Pressure Ulcers
1. **Grade 1**: 
   - Pain/itchiness
   - Discoloration (red in light skin; purple/blue in dark skin)
   - Non-blanching erythema
   - Warm/spongy/hard skin.

2. **Grade 2**: 
   - Partial thickness skin loss
   - May appear as abrasion/blister.

3. **Grade 3**: 
   - Full thickness skin loss reaching subcutaneous tissue.

4. **Grade 4**: 
   - Extensive destruction involving muscle/bone.

### Complications
- Signs of serious infection:
  - Red, swollen skin
  - Pus discharge
  - Cold skin, fast heartbeat
  - Severe pain
  - High temperature

### Investigations
- **Waterlow Score**: Assesses risk based on:
  - Gender
  - Age
  - BMI
  - Skin type
  - Mobility
  - Continence
  - Recent weight loss
  - Nutritional status
  - Comorbidities
  - Medications

- **Scoring Interpretation**:
  - ≤ 9: Little to no risk
  - 10-14: At risk
  - 15-19: High risk
  - ≥ 20: Very high risk

### Management

#### Prescribing
- **Topical Treatment**: 
  - Antiseptic/antibiotic creams typically not recommended.
  - Barrier creams for skin protection.

- **Antibiotics**: 
  - Prescribed only for infected ulcers or serious infections.

#### Non-Prescribing

- **Prevention**:
  - Regular repositioning
  - Pressure-relieving devices (special beds)
  - Daily skin monitoring
  - Healthy, balanced diet; nutritional support
  - Smoking cessation

- **Management to Prevent Worsening**:
  - Use of alginate/hydrocolloid dressings
  - Avoid gauze dressings
  - No soap on ulcers
  - Regular mobilization and repositioning
  - Specialty mattresses/cushions
  - Address dehydration
  - Referral to tissue viability team

#### Debridement
- Remove damaged tissue using specialized dressings or surgical methods.

#### Surgery
- For severe ulcers, involves cleaning and sealing wounds. Risks: tissue death, osteomyelitis, abscesses, DVT, sepsis.
