### Venous Leg Ulcers Overview
- Also known as stasis, insufficiency, or varicose ulcers.
- Caused by sustained venous hypertension from incompetent valves in deep/perforating veins.
- Leads to retrograde blood flow and increased capillary pressure, causing skin changes:
  - Itchy, dry, inflamed skin.
  - Prone to breakdown from minimal trauma.

### Diagnosis
- Common in individuals over 70 (1% prevalence).
- Risk factors:
  - Previous DVT.
  - Familial valve weakness.
- Predominantly affects the medial lower leg (gaiter area).
- Associated symptoms:
  - Oedema.
  - Venous eczema.
  - Brown haemosiderin pigmentation.
  - Varicose veins.
  - Lipodermatosclerosis.
  - Atrophie blanche.
- Characteristics of ulcer:
  - Shallow, irregular margins, moist red tissue with yellowish-grey layer.
  - Significant fluid leakage, usually painless.

### Complications
- Bacterial infection.
- Development of Marjolin’s ulcer (squamous cell carcinoma in chronic ulcers).

### Investigations
- **Doppler ultrasound:** 
  - Detects retrograde flow or prolonged valve closure time (>0.5 seconds).
- **Ankle Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI):**
  - Must be done prior to compression therapy to rule out arterial disease.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Medications:**
  - Pentoxifylline for ulcer healing (with compression therapy).
  - Emollient cream for skin, antibiotics for infections, steroid cream for eczema.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Compression Therapy:**
  - Graded knee-high stockings (class 1 to class 3).
- **Leg Elevation:**
  - Elevate above heart level to reduce oedema and venous hypertension.
- **Dressings:**
  - May be applied under bandages to promote healing and prevent adherence.
- **Surgical Interventions:**
  - If ulcer persists after six months:
    - Surgical debridement to remove necrotic tissue.
    - Skin grafting for large/refractory ulcers.
