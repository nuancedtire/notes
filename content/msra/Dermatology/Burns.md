A burn is skin damage from electrical, chemical, thermal heat, or radiation exposure. Severity varies by depth and size. The American system categorizes burns into first to fourth degree, while the UK system classifies them by affected skin layers. Burn size is measured as a percentage of total body surface area (TBSA).

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Picture:** Diagnosis is based on appearance and symptoms, guiding treatment.
- **Primary Survey:** Assess airway; swelling can compromise it.
- **Secondary Survey:** Examine injuries; determine TBSA percentage and burn depth. 

**Risk Factors:** 
- Male sex
- Age > 60 years
- Young children

### Symptoms
- Dry, erythematous skin
- Painful skin
- Cloudy cornea
- Blisters
- Peeling skin

### Classification of a Burn
#### Superficial Epidermal
- Affects only the epidermis; red skin, no blistering, heals in 7 days, potential hyperpigmentation.

#### Superficial Dermal (Partial Thickness)
- Epidermis and upper dermis burned; may blister, normal capillary return, very painful.

#### Deep Dermal (Partial Thickness)
- Extends to deep dermis; extensive blistering, variable appearance (pale/red), reduced sensation, little to no blanching.

#### Full Thickness
- All skin layers affected; waxy/chard appearance, usually painless, no blistering, skin does not blanch.

### Investigations
- **Not Necessary for Superficial Burns:** 
  - Full blood count
  - Urea and Electrolytes
  - CT scan if fractures or brain injuries suspected.

### Management of Emergencies
**Burn Sepsis**
- Complication from small burns; requires blood cultures and initiation of the sepsis 6 protocol.

**Limb-Threatening Ischemia**
- Occurs 12-24 hours post-injury; may require escharotomy to restore blood flow.

**Inhalation Injury and Airway Oedema**
- Critical assessment needed; treat airway as necessary, consider carboxyhaemoglobin testing and arterial blood gas for metabolic acidosis.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Fluid Resuscitation:** 
  - Parkland formula: 4ml × TBSA (%) × body weight (kg).
  - Administer 50% in first 8 hours, 50% over next 16 hours.
- **Analgesia:** Essential for pain management.
- **Prophylactic Antibiotics:** Consider for extensive burns.
- **Tetanus Immunization:** Essential for unvaccinated individuals.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Inpatient care at burns centers for severe cases.
- **Oxygen Therapy:** For suspected inhalation injuries.
- **Nutritional Support:** Essential, can be parenteral for severely ill.
- **Surgical Debridement:** For full-thickness burns.
- **Escharotomy:** For circumferential burns to relieve blood flow restriction.
- **Nanocrystalline Silver Dressings:** Aid in recovery.
