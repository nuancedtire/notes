#### Variants:
- **Granulomatous rosacea**: Persistent non-inflammatory papules and nodules.

### Investigation

- Global ROSacea COnsensus (ROSCO) classification: One diagnostic or two major phenotypes required.

#### Diagnostic Phenotypes:
- Fixed central facial erythema.
- Phymatous changes.

#### Major Phenotypes:
- Flushing, papules and pustules, telangiectasia, ocular rosacea.

#### Minor Phenotypes:
- Dryness, oedema, burning/stinging sensation.

### Management (Prescribing)
