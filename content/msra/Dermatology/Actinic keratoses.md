### Actinic Keratoses (AK)

- **Description**: Scaly skin lesions from sun-damaged skin; premalignant, can develop into squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Require medical or surgical treatment.

### Diagnosis

- **Location**: Typically on sun-exposed areas (hands, face, balding scalp).
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Old age (senile keratoses).
  - Fitzpatrick skin types Iâ€“III (fair skin, hair, eyes).
  - History of sunburn (especially childhood).
  - Immunocompromised states.
  - Residency in tropical regions.
  - Outdoor occupation or hobbies.

- **Diagnosis Method**: Clinical assessment, ideally with dermatoscope.

#### Classification of Lesions (Table 1)

| **Grade**       | **Appearance**                        |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Mild              | Just visible macules & papules, pink/grey, crusty/scaly |
| Moderate          | Red patches or plaques, scaly, sandpaper-like texture |
| Severe            | Thick hyperkeratotic lesions (like early SCC)          |
| Field change      | Confluent lesions of any grade      |

### Investigations

- **Biopsy**: Obtain for histological analysis only if early SCC or other skin cancer is suspected.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Topical Medical Treatments** (for multiple AK):
  - **Fluorouracil (5-FU, Efudix)**
  - **Imiquimod**
  - **Diclofenac sodium gel**
  
- **Note**: Inform patients to expect skin inflammation from treatments.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Medical/Surgical Procedures**:
  - Cryosurgery
  - Photodynamic therapy
  - Shave excision & curettage
  - Excision
  - Dermabrasion

- **Advice**: Educate patients on skin sun protection measures.
