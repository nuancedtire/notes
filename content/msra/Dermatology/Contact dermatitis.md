## Contact Dermatitis Overview

**Definition:**
- Skin reaction due to contact with an external irritant.
- Can arise from prior sensitization or novel exposure.

**Subtypes:**
1. **Irritant Contact Dermatitis (ICD):** 
   - Does not require prior sensitization.
   - More common than ACD.

2. **Allergic Contact Dermatitis (ACD):** 
   - Delayed reaction (Type 4 hypersensitivity).
   - May be mistaken for ICD.

## Diagnosis

**Basis:**
- Patient history & clinical examination.
- Detailed occupational and social history.
- Previous dermatitis episodes.

**Signs & Symptoms:**
- Pruritus
- Burning
- Swelling
- Erythema
- Hyperpigmentation
- Scaling
- Fissuring

**Location:**
- Symptoms are localized to contact area, helping identify irritant.

**Risk Factors:**
- Occupation (frequent exposure to water/chemicals).
- Atopic dermatitis.
- Suspected CD if risk factors present.

**Differentiation:**
- ICD: stinging, well-defined lesions.
- ACD: intense pruritus, less defined lesions.

## Investigations

1. **Patch Testing:**
   - Tests response to common allergens to pinpoint or rule out CD.

2. **Skin Biopsy:**
   - For unclear diagnosis or chronic cases; differentiates similar inflammatory conditions.

## Management (Prescribing)

**First Line Treatment:**
- Topical corticosteroids for both ICD and ACD.

**ICD Specific:**
- Use moisturizers and topical corticosteroids as needed.
- Start with lowest dose.

**ACD Specific:**
- **Mild/Moderate ACD:**
  - 2nd line: Topical calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus; not for children under 2).
  - 3rd line: Phototherapy (narrowband UVB) for resistant cases.

- **Severe ACD:**
  - 2nd line: Oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone) for poison ivy cases; taper off slowly.
  - 3rd line: Phototherapy.
  - 4th line: Immunosuppressants (e.g., ciclosporin, azathioprine) after corticosteroid failure.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- Avoid known allergens.
- Seek guidance from occupational health teams for occupational exposures.
