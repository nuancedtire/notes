## Congenital Dislocation of the Hip (Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip - DDH)

### Overview
- **Definition**: DDH is a musculoskeletal disorder where the hip joint fails to form properly, leading to instability, subluxation (partial dislocation), or dislocation of the femur from the acetabulum.
- **Prevalence**: 
  - Treatment required in ~2 in 1000 births.
  - Instability in ~20 in 1000 births (typically resolves within weeks).
  
### Factors Contributing to DDH
1. **Hip Joint Laxity**: Loose ligaments around the hip joint.
2. **Intrauterine Space Restriction**:
   - Firstborn child.
   - Oligohydramnios.
   - Breech position during last month of pregnancy or at birth.

### Risk Factors
- **Gender**: Females are 5 times more likely to be affected.
- **Family History**: Increased risk if a first-degree relative has DDH.
- **Laterality**: Left hip is 1.5 times more likely to be affected than the right.
- **Associated Disorders**: Conditions like torticollis, talipes calcaneovalgus, and Down's syndrome increase risk.

### Diagnosis
#### Neonates
- Newborn checks within 72 hours include:
  - **Ortolani’s Test**: Flex hip to 90˚, abduct, press anteriorly, feel for "clunk."
  - **Barlow’s Test**: Hold hip at 90˚, adduct, press posteriorly to dislocate.
  
#### Infants and Older Children
- Signs of DDH after 3 months:
  - **Galeazzi Sign**: Unequal leg length when knees are flexed.
  - Asymmetrical gluteal folds.
  - Delayed crawling/walking or atypical walking patterns (e.g., toe walking).
  - Positive Trendelenburg test in older children.

### Investigations
- **Neonates**: Ultrasound if DDH suspected during checks.
- **Higher Risk**: Ultrasound before 6 weeks.
- **Over 6 Months**: X-ray to check for shallow acetabulum or reduced femoral head growth. Shenton's line may be interrupted in DDH.

### Management
#### Non-Prescribing
- **Immediate Action**: Urgent referral to a paediatric orthopaedic surgeon upon diagnosis.
- **Under 6 Months**: 
  - Use of **Pavlik Harness**: Flexes and partially abducts the hips for proper development; to be worn continuously.
- **Over 6 Months or If Unsuccessful**: 
  - Surgical options (closed/open reduction under general anesthesia); may include osteotomy for bony deformities.
  - Potential need for a plaster cast post-op, with risks of avascular necrosis.

#### Advice for Parents
- Swimming can aid in hip development.
- Avoid tight swaddling as it may contribute to dysplasia.
