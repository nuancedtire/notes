### Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF)

- **Incidence**: 1 in 2,000-3,500 newborns; most common cyanotic congenital heart defect.
- **Characterized by four major abnormalities**:
  1. **Pulmonary stenosis** (mild to atresia; right ventricular outflow tract obstruction)
  2. **Overriding aorta**
  3. **Ventricular septal defect** (VSD)
  4. **Right ventricular hypertrophy**

- **Developmental Anomaly**: 
  - Caused by anterior malalignment of the conal septum.
  
- **Aetiology**: 
  - Multifactorial; 25% of patients with chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 21, 22q11.2 microdeletions like DiGeorge syndrome).

## Diagnosis

- **Presentation**: Most cases identifiable at 1-2 months old.
- **Cyanosis**: 
  - Due to right-to-left shunting of deoxygenated blood; severity varies with pulmonary stenosis and VSD size.
  - Symptoms range from an asymptomatic murmur to cyanosis from birth and “**TET spells**” (life-threatening hypercyanosis).
  
- **Physical Signs**:
  - Cyanosis, clubbing
  - Ejection systolic murmur (loudest at upper left sternal border)
  - Single S2
  - Parasternal heave (right ventricular hypertrophy)

- **Diagnosis Confirmation**: Clinical presentation and echocardiography.

## Investigations

- **Chest X-ray**: Boot-shaped heart (coeur en sabot), right-sided aortic arch, reduced pulmonary vascular markings.
- **ECG**: Right axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy, right bundle branch block.
- **Echocardiography**: Confirms diagnosis; sufficient for surgical planning.
- **Cardiovascular MR/CT**: Useful for assessing pulmonary hypertension.
- **Hyperoxia (nitrogen washout) test**: Diagnoses cyanotic heart disease in neonates.

## Management

### Non-Prescribing

- **Surgical Management**:
  - **Anatomical repair**: Close VSD and relieve RVOT obstruction; usually performed in 3-6 month-olds with good long-term survival.
  - **Palliative shunts**: e.g., modified Blalock–Taussig or Waterston for severely cyanosed neonates.

### Prescribing

- **Prostaglandin E1 infusions**: To maintain ductal patency in severely cyanosed neonates.
- **Beta-blockers**: To reduce RVOT obstruction during TET spells.
