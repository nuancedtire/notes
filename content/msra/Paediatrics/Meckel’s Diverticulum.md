## Meckel’s Diverticulum (MD)

- **Definition**: Most common congenital abnormality of the small intestine; occurs in 1% to 3% of the population. Results from failure of the vitelline duct to regress during fetal development.

### Diagnosis

- **Asymptomatic**: Common but can lead to complications.
- **Symptoms in Children (usually before age 2)**:
  - **Bleeding**: 
    - Acute, episodic, painless
    - May lead to tachycardia and hypotension
  - **Small Bowel Obstruction**: 
    - Intractable constipation, crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting
    - Intussusception can cause palpable mass, “redcurrant jelly” stools
  - **Inflammation**: 
    - Rarer in children; presents with periumbilical pain migrating to right lower quadrant (mimics [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Appendicitis|appendicitis]])
    - Diagnosed via perioperative imaging or surgery
  - **Perforation**: 
    - Sudden, diffuse, severe abdominal pain
    - Exacerbated with movement; associated with rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity, nausea, vomiting, fever, abdominal distention

### Investigation

- **Complication Dependent**:
  - **Bleeding**:
    - FBC: decreased Hb, decreased haematocrit, leucocytosis
    - Technetium-99m pertechnetate scan (Meckel's scan) if stable
    - Contrast enema if intussusception suspected
    - Surgical exploration if diagnosis unclear
  - **Obstruction**:
    - Plain abdominal X-ray: dilated bowel loops, air-fluid levels, no gas distal to obstruction
    - CT scan: diagnose MD as cause
  - **Inflammation/Perforation**:
    - CT scan: image inflamed MD
    - Surgical exploration: do not delay surgery if perforation suspected

### Management

- **Complication Dependent**:
  - **Perforation/Peritonitis**: 
    - Antibiotics (common choices: cefotaxime, clindamycin, metronidazole)
  - **Asymptomatic MD**: No treatment needed if found incidentally.
  - **Surgery found**: Should remove MD in children and young adults.
  - **Symptomatic MD**: 
    - Excision of the diverticulum is definitive.
    - For bleeding: remove ileum region opposite the diverticulum.
    - For obstruction: remove adhesions.
    - For perforation: small bowel resection if extensive pathology present.
