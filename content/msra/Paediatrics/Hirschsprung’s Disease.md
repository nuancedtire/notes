Hirschsprung’s disease is a rare, congenital bowel condition characterized by the absence of ganglion nerve cells in a segment of the bowel, leading to impaired peristalsis and stool blockages. Typically affects the rectum and sigmoid colon, but may also involve the entire colon and part of the small intestine.

## Diagnosis
- Most diagnoses occur within the first year of life.
- Important to consider in cases of severe constipation unresponsive to oral medication.
- Affects males 4 times more than females.

**Symptoms:**

**Neonates:**
- Failure to pass meconium within 48 hours of birth
- Abdominal distension
- Bilious vomiting

**Infants and Children:**
- Abdominal pain
- Persistent constipation
- Failure to thrive

**Complications:**
- Up to 40% may develop Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis, potentially leading to sepsis or toxic megacolon. Symptoms include:
  - Fever
  - Explosive diarrhoea
  - Abdominal swelling
  - Fatigue
  - Vomiting
  - Rectal bleeding

## Investigations
- **Abdominal x-ray:** Excludes bowel obstruction.
- **Contrast enema:** Identifies transition zone between aganglionic and functional bowel.
- **Anorectal manometry:** Assesses anal sphincter muscle function.
- **Rectal biopsy:** Definitive diagnosis; shows absence of ganglion cells under microscopy.

## Management (Prescribing)
- **Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis** is treated with:
  - Broad-spectrum antibiotics
  - Anal irrigation
  - Aggressive IV rehydration
- **Anal irrigation:** Temporary measure before surgery; involves washing the bowel with warm water.

## Management (Non-prescribing)
- **Surgery:** Definitive treatment involves removal of the bowel segment lacking ganglion cells, performed in one or multiple operations based on the child's health.
- **Genetic referral:** Children should be referred to a clinical geneticist if Hirschsprung’s is suspected to be part of a broader genetic condition (e.g., Down syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIA).
