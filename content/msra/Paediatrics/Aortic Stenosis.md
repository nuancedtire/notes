### Aortic Stenosis (AS)

- **Definition**: Narrowing of the aortic valve between the left ventricle and the aorta; most common type of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOT).
- **Population**: More common in males (3:1) than females. Can be congenital or acquired (calcification in adults).
- **Congenital Causes**: 
  - Bicuspid aortic valve (two leaflets instead of three) – ~2% prevalence.
  - Supravalvular aortic stenosis – rarer, associated with Williams syndrome.
  
### Associated Conditions
- 20% of affected children may have additional cardiac abnormalities (e.g., coarctation or dilation of the aorta).
- Possible presence of ventricular septal defects, ductus arteriosus defects, or other valvular abnormalities.
- Fusion of leaflets leading to a single aortic leaflet.

### Diagnosis
- Often asymptomatic, diagnosed incidentally during examination.
- Categories based on age:
  1. **Critical AS in the neonate**
  2. **AS during infancy**
  3. **AS in the older child**

#### **Critical AS in Neonate**
- Signs of distress, potential heart failure or cardiogenic shock shortly after birth.
- Early signs:
  - Cyanosis
  - Cold peripherals
  - Increased capillary refill time
  - Decreased peripheral pulses
  - Gallop rhythm (murmur often absent)

#### **Infantile AS**
- 10% will experience heart failure in the first year.
- Symptoms within the first few months; majority detected by 6 months.
- Signs:
  - Poor feeding/growth
  - Tachypnea
  - Ejection systolic murmur
  - Hepatomegaly in heart failure cases

#### **AS in the Older Child**
- Often asymptomatic; may experience fatigue, collapse, or [[chest pain]] (rarely <5%).
- Examination findings may include:
  - Ejection systolic murmur and apex click
  - Possible [[aortic regurgitation]] (30% prevalence)

### Investigations
- **First-line**: Echocardiogram with Doppler for valve visualization and flow measurement.
- **Other Methods**:
  - Electrocardiogram (ECG): may show left ventricular hypertrophy.
  - Chest X-ray: may indicate cardiomegaly or dilation of the aorta.
  - Cardiac catheterization if diagnosis or intervention remains uncertain.

### Severity Classification
| Severity of Aortic Stenosis | Mean Pressure Gradient (mmHg) | Maximum Pressure Gradient (mmHg) |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Mild                         | <25                           | <40                              |
| Moderate                     | 25-40                         | 40-70                            |
| Severe                       | >40                           | >70                              |

- "Critical stenosis" denotes urgent attention needed at birth.

### Management

#### **Prescribing**
- Rarely uses drug treatment; if critical AS in neonate, intravenous prostaglandin E1 may be used.

#### **Non-Prescribing**
- **Definitive Treatment**: Altering/replacing the damaged valve (e.g., balloon valvuloplasty).
  - Can be performed in utero (21-32 weeks gestation) to prevent hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
  - Recurrence of stenosis may require repeat procedures or valve replacement later on.
  
- **Activity Restrictions**: Children with severe AS should avoid competitive sports due to syncope and [[msra/Cardiovascular/Angina|angina]] risks.
  
- **Endocarditis Risk**: Increased risk for children; first-degree relatives of affected children should undergo echocardiography.
