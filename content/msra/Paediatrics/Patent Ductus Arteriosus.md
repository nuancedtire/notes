### Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)

**Definition**: 
- PDA is when the ductus arteriosus remains open for more than 1 month after the expected delivery date.

### Diagnosis

**Risk Factors**:
- Prematurity
- Maternal rubella infection (first trimester)
- Female gender

**Signs and Symptoms**:
- **Asymptomatic**
- **Murmur**:
  - Continuous 'machine-like' murmur
  - Heard only in systole initially; continues into diastole later
  - Location: Left infraclavicular region, radiates to the back
  - May present with:
    - Left infraclavicular thrill
    - Wide pulse pressure
    - Bounding pulse
    - Heaving apex beat
- **Heart Failure Symptoms**:
  - Failure to thrive
  - Apnoea (especially in premature infants)
  - Tachycardia
  - Shortness of breath, sweating during feeding
  - Exercise intolerance in older children
  - Hepatosplenomegaly
- **Pulmonary Hypertension Symptoms (if late)**:
  - Tachypnoea
  - Increasing respiratory distress (may require mechanical ventilation)

### Investigations

- **Chest X-ray**: Shows cardiomegaly, increased pulmonary vascular markings
- **Echocardiogram**: Definitive test for shunt presence; Doppler characterizes blood flow.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **First-line Therapy**:
  - NSAIDs (e.g., indometacin, ibuprofen) inhibit prostaglandins to promote duct closure.
- **Premature Infants (<32 weeks)**:
  - IV indometacin or ibuprofen.
- **Very Low Birth Weight Infants**:
  - Prophylactic indometacin within 12 hours of birth, prior to PDA evidence.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **In Term Infants, Children, and Adults**:
  - First-line: Percutaneous catheter device closure.
- **If duct is too large or failed medical therapy**:
  - Surgical ligation recommended.
