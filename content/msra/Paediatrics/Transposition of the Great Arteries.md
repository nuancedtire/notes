## Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA)

### Overview
- **TGA** is a cyanotic congenital heart defect.
- In **dextro TGA**, the left and right outflow tracts are transposed:
  - Aorta from the **right ventricle**
  - Pulmonary artery from the **left ventricle**
- Disease is **potentially life-threatening**.

### Diagnosis
- Majority detected **antenatally** during routine screening.
- Postnatal presentation usually occurs after **24 hours** of life:
  - Closure of ductus arteriosus due to increased oxygen concentration.
  - Leads to **cyanosis** (‘blue baby’).
  - Other features include:
    - Low SpO₂
    - Loud, single S2
    - Murmur present only if associated with another abnormality.

### Investigations
- **Chest X-ray**: 
  - Heart may appear normal or have an ‘egg on side’ sign.
  - Increased pulmonary vascular markings typical.
- **ECG**: Typically **normal**.
- **Echocardiography**: Identifies anatomical abnormalities, assesses septal defects, and ductus arteriosus patency.
- **Hyperoxia test (Nitrogen washout)**: Diagnoses cyanotic heart disease in neonates.

### Management
- **Initial Management**:
  1. **Prostaglandin** infusion to maintain ductal patency.
  2. **Balloon atrial septostomy** for intra-atrial mixing.
  
- **Definitive Treatment**:
  - **Surgical arterial switch procedure** usually performed within the first weeks of life.
  
- **Follow-up**: Patients monitored in congenital heart disease clinics throughout adulthood.
