## Intussusception Overview

- **Definition**: Bowel obstruction in children where one segment of the intestine prolapses into another.
- **Common Location**: Ileocaecal valve (ileum telescopes into colon).
- **Primary Cause**: An enlarged lymph node (lead point). Pathological causes include malignant tumors, polyps, or benign masses.
- **Complications**: May lead to life-threatening issues such as bowel necrosis and perforation if untreated.

## Diagnosis

- **Age Group**: Typically affects children aged 3 to 12 months; more common in males.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Episodic crying and leg flexing due to colicky abdominal pain.
  - Lethargy between colic episodes.
  - Bilious vomiting.
  - Rectal bleeding (“redcurrant jelly” appearance).
- **Clinical Findings**:
  - Sausage-shaped abdominal mass (best felt in right upper quadrant/epigastrium).
  - Abdominal distension (if obstructed).
  - Guarding and tenderness (if perforated).
  - Possible hypovolaemic shock in severe cases.

## Investigations

- **Ultrasound**: Highest sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis.
- **Abdominal X-ray**: Necessary if bowel obstruction or perforation is suspected.
- **Contrast or Gas Enema**: Be cautious; risks of bowel perforation exist with gas enema.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Initial Stabilization**:
  - Fluid resuscitation: 20ml/kg IV boluses of normal saline.
  - Insert a nasogastric tube.
  - Administer prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Referral**: All suspected cases should be referred to pediatrics.
- **Non-Surgical Treatment**: 
  - Use of an enema (air, barium, or saline) to increase pressure in the colon and reduce intussusception.
  - If unsuccessful after three attempts, surgical intervention may be necessary.
- **Surgical Options**: Manual reduction may be done laparoscopically or through open surgery.
