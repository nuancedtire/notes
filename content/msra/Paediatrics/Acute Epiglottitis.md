### Overview
**Epiglottitis**  
- Inflammation of the epiglottis, often due to bacterial infection.  
- Emergency condition due to potential airway compromise.  
- Causative organisms: 
  - Haemophilus influenzae (incidence decreased due to Hib vaccine)
  - Streptococcus pneumoniae
  - Staphylococcus aureus  

### **Diagnosis**
- Commonly affects ages **3-5**.  
- Clinical features include:  
  - Sore throat  
  - Dysphagia (pain on swallowing)  
    - Drooling  
    - Poor oral intake  
  - Fever  
  - Respiratory distress:
    - Increased respiratory rate  
    - Tripod position  
    - Intercostal/subcostal/sternal recession  
  - Stridor (indicates airway compromise)  
  - “Toxic” appearance: lethargy, irritability, pallor  
  - Not up to date with vaccinations  

**Important**: Do not lie the child down or use a spatula for examination to avoid anxiety and airway obstruction.

### **Investigations**
- Primarily a clinical diagnosis; confirmed by **laryngoscopy** for epiglottis visualization.  
- Blood cultures post-airway securing to identify causative organism.

### **Management (emergency)**
- Use **ABCDE** approach:  
  - Immediate call for anaesthetics or intensive care  
  - Administer oxygen if needed  
- Perform **direct rigid laryngoscopy with nasotracheal intubation** for airway visualization and securing.  
- **Do not delay intubation** for examination or other interventions.

### **Management (prescribing)**
- Post-intubation:  
  - IV empirical antibiotics (according to local guidelines)  
  - Oral antibiotics for 3-5 days after extubation  
  - Oral corticosteroids to reduce epiglottis edema  
  - Prophylactic **rifampicin** for household contacts, especially unvaccinated children.

### **Management (non-prescribing)**
- Admit to intensive care for intubation and further treatment.
