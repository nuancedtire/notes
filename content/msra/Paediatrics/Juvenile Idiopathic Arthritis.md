## Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)

**Overview:**  
- A group of diseases with joint inflammation lasting at least 6 weeks, onset before 16 years.

### Diagnosis

**Risk Factors:**
- Female gender
- HLA polymorphisms
- Family history of autoimmunity

**Signs and Symptoms:**
- Joint pain (morning stiffness, improved with movement)
- Joint swelling
- Movement limitation (pain or contractures)
- Limp
- Enthesitis (swelling/pain at tendon/ligament insertions)
- Fever
- Rash (salmon-coloured on trunk/extremities, Koebner’s phenomenon)
- Red-eye (association with uveitis)

### Investigations

- Clinical diagnosis with potential tests for differentiation and classification.
  
**Subtypes (I.L.A.R. Classification):**

| Subtype                           | Clinical Features                                                         | Investigation Abnormalities                       |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Oligoarthritis                     | Affects 1-4 joints, stiffness, reduced motion, minimal pain            | ANA positive                                      |
| Polyarthritis (RF negative)        | Affects ≥5 joints, symmetrical, stiffness/pain with minimal swelling    | RF negative; may have mild anaemia, thrombocytosis, elevated ESR/CRP |
| Polyarthritis (RF positive)        | Affects ≥5 joints, symmetrical, stiffness/pain with minimal swelling    | RF positive; may have mild anaemia, thrombocytosis, elevated ESR/CRP |
| Systemic arthritis                 | Oligo/polyarthritis, spiking fevers, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, serositis | Anaemia, leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) |
| Psoriatic arthritis                | Asymmetrical arthritis, psoriatic skin lesions, dactylitis, nail pitting | None                                             |
| Enthesitis-related arthritis       | Large joint lower limb/spine arthritis, enthesitis, anterior uveitis    | HLA-B27 positive                                  |
| Undifferentiated arthritis         | JIA that does not meet criteria for other forms                         | None                                             |

### Management (Prescribing)

**First-line Treatments:**
- Conservative measures and NSAIDs for pain relief (non-disease modifying).

**If insufficient:**
- Disease-modifying agents: Methotrexate, Sulfasalazine
  - Methotrexate: Monitor liver function
  - Sulfasalazine: Monitor FBC and metabolic panel

**Adjunct Treatments:**
- Corticosteroids (oral/intra-articular)
- Folic acid (reduces side effects)
- Antiemetics (relieve nausea)
- NSAIDs (for pain relief)
- Physiotherapy and occupational therapy

**Third-line Options:**
- TNF-alpha inhibitors
- Biologics

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

**Multidisciplinary Approach:**
- Encourage regular exercise 
- Use of heat packs for pain/stiffness
- Foot orthoses to reduce pain and improve quality of life
