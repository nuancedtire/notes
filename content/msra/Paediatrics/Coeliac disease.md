Coeliac disease is an autoimmune condition with a permanent intolerance to gluten (barley, wheat, rye, oats), affecting 1% of the population. It may be associated with:

- Type 1 diabetes
- IgA deficiency
- Down's Syndrome

**Diagnosis**

- Can present at any age, typically in childhood or adulthood.
- In infants, symptoms may appear upon gluten introduction.
- Common symptoms include:
  - Chronic diarrhoea
  - Pale floating stools
  - Fatigue
  - Poor growth (failure to thrive in children)
  - Rectal bleeding
  - Vomiting
  - Dermatitis herpetiformis (itchy blisters)
- Signs of undetected late Coeliac disease:
  - Poor growth
  - Developmental delay
  - Iron deficiency anaemia
  - Nutritional deficiencies
  - Joint pain
- Untreated Coeliac disease may lead to a Coeliac crisis (dehydration and malabsorption).

**Investigations**

Performed if symptoms, family history, or risk factors are present. Key investigations include:

1. Full blood count and blood film (may reveal microcytic anaemia).
2. Serum tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody (TTG) – first-line, nearly 100% sensitivity/specificity.
3. Endomysial antibody (EMA) – second-line, more expensive, lower sensitivity.
4. Anti-gliadin antibody – rarely used, less reliable.

If tests suggest Coeliac disease, a biopsy via endoscopy is performed to check for:

- Villous atrophy
- Crypt hyperplasia
- Increased lymphocytes in the epithelium

Patients should continue gluten consumption during testing to avoid misleading results.

**Management (Prescribing)**

No curative drug treatment; supportive medications may include:

- Iron, vitamin D, calcium (for deficiencies)
- For Coeliac crisis: fluids, corticosteroids, electrolyte replacement.

**Management (Non-Prescribing)**

- Lifelong gluten-free diet is the primary treatment, resolving symptoms and returning gut appearance to normal.
- Gluten-free alternatives may be prescribed on the NHS in the UK.
- Long-term consequences are avoided with strict adherence to the diet. Ingestion of gluten can lead to villous atrophy recurrence. 
- Uncontrolled Coeliac disease increases cancer risks (e.g., adenocarcinoma, lymphomas).
- Well-controlled Coeliac disease presents a similar risk to the general population.
- TTG testing can evaluate adherence to the gluten-free diet; improvement in children's growth indicates successful management.
