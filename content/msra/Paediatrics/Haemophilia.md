## Overview of Haemophilia

- **Definition**: Blood clotting disorder causing excessive, uncontrollable bleeding.
- **Causes of Bleeding**:
  - Mild injury
  - Trauma
  - Surgery
  - Dental treatment
- **Spontaneous Bleeding**: Can occur without apparent cause.
- **Types**:
  - **Haemophilia A**: Factor VIII deficiency (most common, 1 in 5000 males).
  - **Haemophilia B**: Factor IX deficiency (1 in 20,000 males). Includes Haemophilia B Leyden, where bleeding decreases post-puberty.
  
## Diagnosis
  
- **Symptoms**:
  - History of recurrent/severe bleeding.
  - Severe cases often diagnosed in the first year.
  - Neonatal symptoms:
    - Prolonged bleeding (heel prick/circumcision)
    - Intracranial hemorrhage (3-5% of neonates)
    - Symptoms of intracranial hemorrhage:
      - Hypoactivity
      - Irritability
      - Bulging fontanelle
      - Seizures
      - Pallor
      - Decreased oral intake

- **Common signs**:
  - Musculoskeletal bleeding (haemarthrosis):
    - Pain
    - Swelling
    - Reduced joint movement
    - Erythema
    - Calor
  - Chronic joint damage possible with recurrent bleeding.

- **Other Symptoms**:
  - Mucocutaneous bleeding (epistaxis, petechiae).
  - Fatigue from iron deficiency anemia after significant bleeding.
  - Female carriers may experience menorrhagia.

## Investigations
  
- **Prenatal Screening**: Possible if mother is a known carrier (chorionic villus sampling; fetal blood sampling).
- **Blood Tests**:
  - Normal complete blood count.
  - Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).
  - Normal prothrombin time (PT).
  - Normal fibrinogen levels.
  
- **Classification**: Severity graded as mild, moderate, or severe based on factor levels.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Treatment Approaches**:
  - **Preventative Treatment**: Regular factor replacement (lifelong).
  - **On-Demand Treatment**: Immediate treatment for bleeding, mostly in mild/moderate cases.

- **Regular Testing**: For inhibitors (antibodies against clotting factors).
- **Immune Tolerance Induction**: Daily injections for severe Haemophilia A.
- **Bypassing Agents/Immunosuppressants**: Options for mild/moderate Haemophilia A.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Joint Care**: 
  - Monitoring for chronic joint damage due to haemarthrosis.
  - Possible surgery for damaged synovium or joint replacements.

- **Physiotherapy**: Supports fitness and muscle strengthening; encourages safer participation in sports.

- **Psychosocial Support**: Beneficial for patients and families.
