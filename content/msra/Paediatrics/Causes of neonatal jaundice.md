- **Prevalence**: Over 50% of newborn infants are affected by neonatal jaundice.

- **Classification**:
  - **Physiological Jaundice**: Normal adaptation from fetal to infant life.
  - **Pathological Jaundice**: Due to underlying disease processes.

- **Timing of Jaundice**:
  - **First 24 hours**: Always pathological (e.g., Rhesus haemolytic disease, ABO incompatibility, G6PD deficiency causing haemolytic anemia).
  
  - **24 hours to 2 weeks**: Can be either physiological or pathological (causes include breastfeeding, dehydration, infection, haemolytic disease).
  
  - **After 2 weeks**: Known as prolonged jaundice; possible causes include physiological factors, infection, haemolysis, obstructive gastrointestinal conditions (e.g., pyloric stenosis, biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis).

- **Management**:
  - Conduct clinical assessment to determine severity.
  - Measure serum bilirubin (conjugated vs. unconjugated).
  - Treat underlying cause and jaundice (interventions range from hydration to phototherapy, and exchange transfusion in severe cases).

- **Importance**:
  - Recognizing causes of neonatal jaundice is crucial for identifying serious cases and ensuring appropriate management.
  - Untreated serious causes can lead to disability and death.
