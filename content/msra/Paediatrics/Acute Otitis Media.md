Acute otitis media (AOM) is an inflammation of the middle ear primarily due to infection.

**Causative Agents:**
- **Respiratory Viruses:** 
  - RSV
  - Rhinovirus
- **Bacteria:**
  - Streptococcus pneumoniae
  - Haemophilus influenzae
  - Moraxella catarrhalis

**Peak Incidence:** Ages 6-18 months.

### Diagnosis

**Risk Factors:**
- Craniofacial anomalies (e.g., cleft palate)
- Immunodeficiency
- Childcare or nursery attendance
- Exposure to unwell siblings
- Absence of breastfeeding
- Feeding in a supine position
- Family history

**Clinical Features:**
- Unilateral otalgia (ear pain)
- Decreased hearing or popping sensation on affected side
- Coryza
- Fever
- Irritability
- Sleep disturbance
- Preceding upper respiratory tract infection

**Examination Findings:**
- Bulging, erythematous, and opaque tympanic membrane
- Purulent otorrhea suggests perforated tympanic membrane

### Investigations

- AOM is primarily a clinical diagnosis; no specific investigation is needed.
- Optional tests:
  - Tympanometry or acoustic reflectometry for effusion (not commonly performed)
  - Culture of discharge or aspirate via tympanocentesis

### Management (Prescribing)

- **First-line Treatment:** Regular oral or rectal paracetamol and ibuprofen.
- **Delayed Antibiotic Prescription:** If symptoms do not improve in 2-3 days, antibiotics (commonly amoxicillin per local guidelines) are recommended.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- If AOM is unresponsive to antibiotics or severe otalgia is present, consider tympanocentesis in a secondary care setting for further information and to relieve pressure and pain.
