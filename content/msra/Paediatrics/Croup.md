Croup Overview
==============

- **Definition**: Respiratory condition, typically viral, affecting children aged 6 months to 6 years.
- **Other names**: Laryngotracheobronchitis.
- **Causes**:
  - Parainfluenza virus
  - Respiratory syncytial virus
  - Influenza virus

### Types of Croup
- **Viral Croup**: Most common presentation.
- **Spasmodic/Recurrent Croup**: Inflammation without other symptoms.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Basis**: Combination of signs/symptoms.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Common cold symptoms: sore throat, hoarse voice, runny nose.
  - Barking cough (prominent in younger children).
  - Fever (usually < 38.5°C).
  - Stridor (helps determine severity).
- **Croup Severity Classification**:
  1. **Mild**: Barking cough, no stridor, recession, or lethargy.
  2. **Moderate**: Barking cough, stridor, recession at rest, no lethargy.
  3. **Severe**: Barking cough, stridor, recession, agitation or lethargy.
  4. **Impending Respiratory Failure**: Stridor, out-of-sync breathing, signs of tiring, hypoxic, hypercapnic.

### Examination Observations
- **Signs of Severe Croup**: Agitation, quiet or absent breath sounds, pale/cyanosis, worsening drowsiness.
- **Vital Signs**:
  - Respiratory rate: high initially, lowers with failure.
  - Oxygen saturation: low.
  - Heart rate: high due to fever.
  - Temperature: typically < 38.5°C.

### Investigations
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: No additional investigations usually required.
- **Chest X-ray**: Not recommended (may agitate child). Possible "Steeple Sign" (narrowed trachea).

### Management (Prescribing)
#### Mild Croup
- **Steroids**:
  - Prednisolone: 2 mg/kg orally for 3 days.
  - Dexamethasone: single dose of 0.15 mg/kg orally.
  - Budesonide: single nebulized dose of 2 mg.

#### Moderate Croup
- **Add Nebulized Adrenaline**: 5ml of 1 in 1000 adrenaline, relieves symptoms within 30 minutes.

#### Severe Croup
- **Combine Treatments**: Steroids, nebulized adrenaline, oxygen. Intubation if respiratory failure occurs.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Mild Croup**: Home management, hydration, calming techniques. Monitor for worsening symptoms.
- **High-Risk Groups**: Children <1 year, prior intubation/severe croup should be monitored in the hospital.
- **Steam Therapy**: Anecdotal support, no scientific evidence.
- **Hospital Support**: 10% of children may require this, most are discharged quickly.
- **Monitoring**: Hospitalized children should be observed for at least 3 hours post-treatment with follow-up care.
