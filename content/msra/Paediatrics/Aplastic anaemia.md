### Aplastic Anaemia Overview
- **Definition**: Destruction of bone marrow, leading to reduced production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets (pancytopenia).
- **Incidence**: Rare, with approx. 30-40 cases per year in UK children; peaks in childhood and over 60 years with equal distribution among races and genders.
- **Causes**:
  - Inherited (rare): e.g., Fanconi’s anaemia.
  - Acquired (common):
    - 80% idiopathic
    - 9% post-hepatitis (A, B, C)
    - 7% post-viral infections (CMV, EBV, parvovirus)
    - 4% due to medications or chemicals (e.g., radiotherapy, chemotherapy, chloramphenicol).

### Diagnosis
- **Presentation**: 
  - Bruising, skin changes (purpura), mucosal bleeding, fatigue, malaise, higher infection/fewer recovery rates.
  
- **Investigations**:
  - Full blood count: Look for pancytopenia (low red cells, reticulocytes, white cells, platelets).
  - Bone Marrow Aspirate/Biopsy: Hypocellular bone marrow with fat replacement.

#### Severity Criteria from Bone Marrow Biopsy
| Bone Marrow Cell Levels             | Moderate          | Severe           | Very Severe      |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Neutrophils (x10^9/L)              | <1.5              | <0.5             | <0.2             |
| Platelets (x10^9/L)                | <100              | <20              | <20              |
| Bone Marrow Cellularity (%)         | <50               | <30              | <30              |

- **Genetic Testing**: To rule out other diagnoses or identify inherited conditions.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Goals**:
  1. Alleviate symptoms (e.g., transfusions for red cells and platelets).
  2. Address underlying cause.
  
- **First-line Treatment**: Discussed in non-prescribing. 
- **Second-line Treatment**: ATG followed by cyclosporin.

- **Family Awareness**: Risks associated with pancytopenia (e.g., infection). Immediate medical attention for illness or fever is crucial.

- **Further Treatments**: Limited post-ATG/cyclosporin; poor prognosis if treatments fail. Eltrombopag is in trials for increasing cell levels.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Known Causes**: Address prior to starting treatments (e.g., stop medications or treat viral causes).
  
- **First-line Treatment**: Bone marrow transplant; potential sibling match (25%) or unrelated donor listing.

- **Prognosis**: Variable; rare spontaneous resolution. Bone marrow transplant offers the best chance for cure.

- **Complications**: Untreated aplastic anaemia may lead to leukaemia or paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria.
