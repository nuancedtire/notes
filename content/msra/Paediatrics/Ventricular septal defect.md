## Ventricular Septal Defects (VSD)

### Overview
- Second most common congenital heart defect (after bicuspid aortic valves).
- Holes in ventricular septum: 
  - Most common: Membranous septum (perimembranous defects).
  - Less common: Muscular septum.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Presentation:**
  - **Loud pansystolic murmur:** Loudest at lower left sternal border (due to left-to-right shunting).
  - **Tachypnoea** at rest or during feeding.
  - **Failure to thrive** for large VSDs.
  - **Loud S2 and mid-diastolic murmur:** Suggests pulmonary hypertension and high flow through the tricuspid valve.
- **Diagnostic Tool:** Echocardiography.

### Investigations
- **Chest X-ray:** Usually normal; may show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings.
- **ECG:** 
  - Small VSDs: Normal ECG.
  - Larger VSDs: Signs of ventricular hypertrophy.
- **Echocardiography:** For diagnosis, severity assessment, and checking for associated abnormalities (e.g., [[aortic regurgitation]], pulmonary stenosis).

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Small VSDs:** 
  - Usually asymptomatic; often close spontaneously within the first couple of years.
  - No treatment or follow-up needed.
- **Larger VSDs:**
  - Symptom management:
    - Diuretics: To decrease pulmonary congestion.
    - Calorie supplementation/nasogastric tube feeding: To support growth and nutrition.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Surgery:** 
  - Indicated for large VSDs causing symptomatic heart failure and faltering growth.
  - Generally performed within the first 6 months of life.
