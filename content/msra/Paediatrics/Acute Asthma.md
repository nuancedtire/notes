Asthma Overview:
- Characterized by bronchoconstriction, inflammation, and excessive mucus production.
- Acute exacerbations triggered by:
  - Infection
  - Allergens
  - Environmental pollutants (e.g., tobacco smoke)
  - Exercise
  - Drugs (e.g., NSAIDs)
  - High emotions (e.g., anxiety, sadness)

### Diagnosis
Common clinical features of acute asthma:
- Respiratory distress: shortness of breath, increased respiratory rate, low O2 sats, accessory muscle use, intercostal/subcostal/sternal recession, tripod position, tracheal tug
- Wheeze: polyphonic, high-pitched, widespread expiratory sounds; biphasic wheeze indicates impending airway obstruction
- [[Chest pain]]
- Cough
- Tachycardia
- Inability to speak
- Poor feeding
- Risk factors:
  - Personal/family history of atopy or asthma
  - Exposure to triggers
  - Preceding infection
  - Poor inhaler technique/compliance

### Investigations
Adopt an ABCDE approach for suspected acute asthma:
- Bedside:
  - Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) or FEV1
- Blood Tests:
  - Arterial blood gas (ABG) for life-threatening cases
  - Inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP) if infection is suspected
- Imaging:
  - Chest X-ray indicated only if other diagnoses (e.g., pneumonia, pneumothorax) are suspected

### Severity Grading (NICE guidelines)
1. **Moderate**:
   - PEFR ≥ 50% of best/predicted
   - No features of acute severe/life-threatening asthma
2. **Acute Severe**:
   - PEFR 33-50% of best/predicted
   - SpO2 < 92%
   - Increased respiratory & heart rates based on age
   - Inability to complete sentences
   - Accessory muscle use
   - Poor feeding
3. **Life-threatening**:
   - SpO2 < 92% AND any of:
     - PEFR < 33% of best/predicted
     - Cyanosis
     - Hypotension
     - Exhaustion
     - Silent chest
     - Arrhythmia
     - Poor respiratory effort
     - Altered consciousness/confusion

### Management (Prescribing)
Drugs for acute asthma:
- **Oxygen**: For life-threatening cases or SpO2 < 94% (target 94-98%)
- **Inhaled Bronchodilators**:
  - SABA (e.g., salbutamol):
    - Mild: inhaler + spacer (up to 10 puffs)
    - Moderate/Life-threatening: nebulizers (salbutamol + oxygen back-to-back)
  - Ipratropium bromide if unresolved after 3 salbutamol nebulizers
  - Magnesium sulfate if SpO2 < 92%
- **Corticosteroids**: Oral, IV, or IM for moderate to life-threatening cases
- **IV Bronchodilation**: If symptoms persist
  - IV magnesium sulfate (first-line)
  - IV salbutamol
  - Aminophylline for severe/life-threatening asthma unresponsive to bronchodilators/steroids
- **Antibiotics**: As per local policies for bacterial infection triggers

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
Criteria for hospital admission:
- Acute severe and above (PEFR < 50%, SpO2 < 92%)
- No response to high-dose inhaled bronchodilators
- Signs of exhaustion

Transfer to intensive care if there’s no improvement with initial therapies or signs of respiratory failure. 

### Discharge Criteria
Patient may be discharged when:
- Stable on 3-4 hourly inhaled bronchodilators (to continue at home)
- PEFR > 75%
- SpO2 > 94%
