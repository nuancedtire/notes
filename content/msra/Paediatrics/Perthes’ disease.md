## Perthes’ Disease Overview

- **Definition**: Rare disorder affecting hip joint in children (ages 4-9 years).
- **Cause**: Avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis; idiopathic in nature.
  
## Diagnosis

- **Demographics**: More common in boys (5:1 ratio vs. girls); 12% bilateral involvement.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Insidious onset
  - Painless limp
  - Intermittent hip, groin, or knee pain (especially during physical activity)
- **Signs**:
  - Antalgic gait
  - Loss of internal rotation and hip abduction

## Investigations

- **Imaging** is crucial for diagnosis and severity assessment.
  - **X-ray**:
    - Views: AP and ‘frog leg’ lateral
    - Early stages may appear normal.
    - Features: Increased density, flattening/fragmenting of femoral head, joint space widening.
  - **Bone scans & MRI**: More sensitive than X-rays; used if radiograph is normal.

## Management

- **Care Team**: Managed by pediatric orthopedic surgeons.
- **Follow-Up**: Regular examinations and imaging every few months.
  
### Treatment Goals

- Prevent deformity
- Delay osteoarthritis
 
### Treatment Options

- **Conservative**:
  - Rest
  - Exercise restriction
  - Analgesia
  - Physiotherapy
  - Immobilization
- **Surgical**: Femoral head ostectomy for severe cases.
