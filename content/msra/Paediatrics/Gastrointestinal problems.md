- **Key Congenital Defects Awareness**
  - Essential due to potential severe neonatal problems.
  - Important to recognize bowel obstruction causes in infants.

- **First-line Investigation** 
  - Abdominal x-ray post-examination of abdomen and rectum.
  - Guides diagnosis.

- **Hirschsprung Disease**
  - **Cause**: Congenital absence of myenteric nerve plexus in colon.
  - **Clinical Presentation**:
    - Failure to pass meconium within 48 hours.
    - Bowel obstruction (pain, abdominal distension, vomiting).
    - Bilious vomiting (obstruction below Ampulla of Vater).
    - Later presentation may cause bowel obstruction or chronic constipation.
  - **Genetic Association**: Linked to Down syndrome.

- **Diagnosis** 
  - Confirmation via rectal biopsy (absence of myenteric nerve plexuses).

- **Management**
  - Immediate: Bowel irrigation to clear faecal matter.
  - Definitive: Surgical treatment, typically colostomy required.
