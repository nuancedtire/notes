Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an extra chromosome 21. The three possible causes are:

- **Trisomy 21**: Extra chromosome 21 in all cells, resulting from nondisjunction during cell division. This is the most common form.
- **Mosaic Down Syndrome**: Extra chromosome 21 present in some, but not all, cells due to errors in cell division after fertilization.
- **Translocation Down Syndrome**: Extra chromosome 21 attached to another chromosome. This may occur if a parent has a balanced translocation, which can lead to an unbalanced translocation in the child.

## Diagnosis

Children with Down Syndrome typically have mild to moderate intellectual disabilities and may experience developmental delays and behavioral issues, necessitating lifelong support. Common physical characteristics include:

- Low set ears
- Small head, ears, and mouth
- Short neck
- Almond-shaped eyes
- Flattened nasal bridge
- Single palmar crease
- Short stature
- Hypotonia

Increased risk of other conditions includes:

- **Congenital heart disease**: Refer to a paediatric cardiologist.
- **Vision problems**: Such as cataracts and short-sightedness.
- **Hearing issues**: Due to recurrent ear infections.
- **Hypothyroidism**.
- **Blood disorders**: Including leukaemia and anaemia.
- **Gastrointestinal issues**: Such as coeliac disease.
- **Mental health challenges**: Anxiety, depression, ADHD.
- **Early-onset Alzheimer’s** (from age 50).

## Investigations

### Combined Test
- Conducted between 10-14 weeks of pregnancy combining maternal age, blood test results, and ultrasound to screen for Down Syndrome, Edwards’ Syndrome, and Patau’s Syndrome. Nuchal translucency is measured; increased thickness raises concern.

### Quadruple Test
- For those unable to measure nuchal translucency, this blood test is done between 14-20 weeks, screening specifically for Down Syndrome.

### Diagnostic Tests
- Offered if screening suggests Down Syndrome, carrying up to a 1% miscarriage risk:
  - **Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS)**: Between 11-14 weeks, testing cells from the placenta.
  - **Amniocentesis**: From week 15, testing cells from amniotic fluid.

### Postnatal Diagnosis
- Karyotype analysis if there is uncertainty in diagnosis.

## Management (Prescribing)

There is no cure for Down Syndrome; management focuses on supporting physical and intellectual development while monitoring for and addressing associated conditions.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

Children may require support from various healthcare professionals:

- Physiotherapist
- Speech and language therapist
- Occupational therapist
- Pediatric specialists (e.g., cardiologist, ophthalmologist)
- Psychological support
- Educational support

Parents may also benefit from genetic counseling.
