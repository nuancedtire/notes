## Pre-eclampsia Overview

- **Definition**: Pregnancy-induced hypertension with proteinuria (>0.3 g/24 hours), with or without oedema. Can lead to serious risks for mother and fetus.
- **Key Characteristics**: 
  - Maternal hypertension
  - Proteinuria
  - Oedema
  - Intrauterine growth restriction
  - Premature birth
- **Eclampsia**: Escalation of symptoms leading to seizures.

### Diagnosis

- **Pre-eclampsia Prevalence**: ~0.5% of pregnancies; Eclampsia occurs in ~10% of these.
- **Death Rate**: 0.38 per 100,000 pregnancies.

#### Risk Factors

- First pregnancy or significant gap since last pregnancy
- Advanced maternal age
- BMI >35
- Family history
- Multiple pregnancies
- Comorbidities:
  - Previous pre-eclampsia
  - Pre-existing hypertension
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - Autoimmune diseases

#### Signs and Symptoms

- **General Indicators**: 
  - Systolic BP >140 mm Hg or diastolic BP >90 mm Hg in second half of pregnancy
  - ≥1+ proteinuria on urine dipstick.
- **Severe Pre-eclampsia**: 
  - Diastolic BP >110 mmHg or systolic BP >160 mmHg
  - Symptoms: severe headache, sudden swelling, visual disturbances, epigastric pain, vomiting.
  - Laboratory Indicators: 
    - Platelet count <100 x 10^9/L
    - Abnormal liver enzymes (ALT/AST >70 IU/L).
- **Other Features**: Clonus, HELLP syndrome (Haemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets), papilloedema, fetal distress, growth restriction.
- **Timing of Eclampsia**: Often occurs postpartum, typically within four days but can extend up to four weeks.

### Investigations

- **Urinalysis**: Microscopy, culture, and sensitivities if proteinuria present.
- **Monitoring**: Frequent FBC, LFTs, renal function, electrolytes, serum urate.
- **Additional Tests**: Clotting studies for severe pre-eclampsia; 24-hour urine collections for protein and creatinine clearance.
- **Ultrasound**: Assess fetal growth, amniotic fluid volume, umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry.
- **Imaging**: MRI or CT is not indicated in uncomplicated eclampsia unless ruling out other diagnoses.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Antihypertensives**: 
  - Labetalol (oral/IV), alternative: methyldopa or nifedipine to maintain BP within target (<150/80-100 mm Hg).
  - For severe hypertension (systolic >160 mm Hg or diastolic >110 mm Hg): Treat aggressively.
- **Seizure Prophylaxis**: Magnesium sulfate (4g IV followed by infusion).
- **Fluid Management**: Fluid restriction recommended to avoid overload.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Cure**: Delivery of the placenta.
- **Monitoring** based on severity of BP:
  - **Mild (140-149/90-99 mm Hg)**: Twice-weekly blood tests.
  - **Moderate (150-159/100-109 mm Hg)**: Three times per week blood tests.
  - **Severe (≥160/110 mm Hg)**: Three times per week blood tests.
- **Ultrasound and CTG**: Regular fetal assessments post-diagnosis.

- **Delivery Management**: Considered on a case-by-case basis in a multidisciplinary approach.
