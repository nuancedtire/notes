Coronary artery disease (CAD) overview, risk factors, prevention strategies, risk assessments, treatment options, and emergency management:

## Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
- **Description:** Most common cardiovascular disease, caused by atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries.

### Risk Factors:
#### Non-modifiable:
- Gender (male)
- Family history of cardiovascular diseases (CVD)
- Ethnic background (e.g., South Asians)
- Age >50 years

#### Modifiable:
- Hypertension
- Dyslipidaemia
- Obesity
- Diabetes mellitus
- Psychosocial factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, social isolation)
- Low physical activity
- Unhealthy diet
- Smoking
- Excessive alcohol intake

### Consequences of Untreated CAD:
- Weakens heart muscle
- Possible outcomes: stable/unstable [[angina]], myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias

## Prevention:
- Education on lifestyle changes: 
  - Balanced, healthy diet 
  - Regular physical activity 
  - Smoking cessation 
  - Limited alcohol intake

- Regular investigation and management of comorbidities:
  - Hypertension, peripheral arterial disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, stroke/TIA, obesity

## Risk Assessment:
- **Who:** All patients >40 years with no CVD history every 5 years; those with a family history of premature atherosclerotic CVD or familial dyslipidaemia regardless of age.
  
- **Tools:**
  - SCORE Risk Chart: for patients with no past CVD history.
  - QRISK®2 and JBS3: for patients with past CVD and other comorbidities.

## Treatment:
### Primary Prevention:
- Anti-platelet therapy: NOT recommended
- Anti-hypertensive medications for high-risk patients with BP >140/90 mmHg.
- Statins: low-dose atorvastatin for patients with ≥10% risk of developing CVD.

### Secondary Prevention:
- Anti-platelet therapy: aspirin 75mg for all patients.
- Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT): aspirin + clopidogrel (or prasugrel/ticagrelor) after [[acute coronary syndrome]] (ACS).
- Statins: atorvastatin 80 mg for all patients; switch if intolerant.
- ACEI: for all patients.
- Anti-hypertensive therapy: aim for BP <130/80 mmHg.
- Beta-blockers: up to 12 months post significant anterior wall damage; continue for specific indications.

### Symptom Management:
- Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) for acute [[chest pain]].
- Beta-blockers for tachycardia and stable [[msra/Cardiovascular/Angina|angina]].
- Nicorandil, ranolazine, ivabradine for persistently symptomatic patients.

### Surgical Management:
- Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
- Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).

## Emergencies:
- **Presentation:** Ischaemic [[chest pain]], anxiety, variable blood pressure, arrhythmia, raised JVP, peripheral oedema, new heart murmur, lung crackles, increased respiratory rate, pale/sweaty appearance.

- **Diagnosis:** 12-lead ECG and cardiac troponins. Treat STEMI without waiting for troponin results.

### Management of Full-Thickness MI:
- **Initial management:**
  - Morphine or diamorphine + antiemetic
  - Oxygen
  - Aspirin + clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor + heparin
  - Nitrates: sublingual GTN, intravenous if pain persists
  - Consider beta-blockers and ACEI.

- **Reperfusion Therapy:**
  - PCI preferred within 60-120min of first medical intervention.
  - Thrombolytic therapy if PCI not feasible within 90min.
  - CABG for unsuccessful PCI/thrombolysis or in cardiac shock.

- **Post-ACS Treatment:**
  - High-dose statin and ACEI for all patients.
  - Dual antiplatelet therapy: aspirin for life and clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor for 12 months.
  - Cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes recommended.
