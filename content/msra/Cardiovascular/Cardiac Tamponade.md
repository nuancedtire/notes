The heart is surrounded by a fibrous casing known as the **pericardial sac**, with a potential space in between called the **pericardial space**. **Cardiac tamponade** occurs when blood, fluid, pus, clots, or gas accumulate in this space, increasing pressure on the ventricle and leading to reduced ventricular filling, which can be life-threatening.

### Diagnosis

- **Incidence**: Approximately 2 cases per 10,000 in the U.S. Population; more common in younger individuals due to trauma or HIV, and in older adults due to malignancy or chronic kidney disease.

#### Causes
- **Pericarditis**:
  - Malignancy (particularly breast or lung cancer)
  - Acute myocardial infarction/post-infarction pericarditis (Dresslerâ€™s syndrome)
  - Infective causes (viral, bacterial, fungal)
  - Connective tissue diseases (SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.)
  - Radiation exposure
  - Myxoedema (hypothyroidism)
  - Chronic kidney disease
  - Post-operative hemorrhagic pericarditis
  - Idiopathic causes
- **Medications**: Hydralazine, isoniazid, minoxidil
- **Procedures**: Cardiac perforation during diagnostics
- **Trauma**: 2% incidence in penetrating trauma; possible in blunt trauma
- **Surgery**
- **Aortic dissection**

### Symptoms
- Subacute presentation: anxiety, fatigue, edema, confusion
- Dyspnea, tachycardia, tachypnea
- Cold extremities due to compromised perfusion
- Possible features of pericarditis

### Signs
- **Beck's Triad** (late sign): Hypotension, muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins
- Tachycardia, tachypnea, hepatomegaly
- Potential pericardial rub
- **Pulsus Paradoxus**: >10 mmHg drop in systemic blood pressure during inspiration
- Abolition of y descent in JVP due to increased intrapericardial pressure
- Cyanosis and pulmonary edema

### Diagnosis and Management of Emergencies
- **Blood Tests**:
  - Creatine kinase, renal function, FBC for infection
  - Antinuclear antibody, ESR, rheumatoid factors
  - HIV and Acid-Fast Bacilli testing
- **ECG**: Sinus tachycardia, low voltage QRS complexes, PR depression
- **Chest X-Ray**: Signs of cardiomegaly, 'bottle-shaped' heart, pericardial calcifications
- **Echocardiogram**: Reduced ventricular filling
- **Pericardiocentesis**: Aspiration for culture and cytology 

### Management
- Utilize intensive care setting.
- **Echocardiography-guided pericardiocentesis**: Primary treatment to remove pericardial fluid; thoracotomy may be needed in trauma cases.
- Address underlying causes.

#### Primary Survey
- **A-B-C**: Airway, Breathing, Circulation
  - Oxygen therapy
  - Small volume fluid resuscitation; blood if traumatic
  - Leg elevation to enhance venous return
  - Use of positive inotropic drugs (e.g., Dobutamine)
  - Avoid positive-pressure mechanical ventilation

#### Surgical Management
- **Pericardiodesis**: For recurrent effusion/tamponade
- **Pericardio-peritoneal shunt**: To prevent recurrent tamponade in malignant cases
- **Pericardiectomy**: Rarely required resection of pericardium
