### Myocardial Infarction Complications

#### Cardiac Complications

- **Pericarditis**
  - Onset: 24-96 hours post anterior MI
  - Incidence: ~10% (lower with early reperfusion)
  - Symptoms: Low-grade fever, pericardial rub, pleuritic [[chest pain]]
  - ECG: ST elevation in all leads (no reciprocal ST depression)
  - Chest X-Ray: Globular cardiac enlargement
  - Treatment: Anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesia, repeat echocardiogram if effusion present

- **Dressler’s Syndrome**
  - Occurrence: 1-3% of patients 2-5 weeks post-MI
  - Symptoms: Febrile illness, pericardial/pleural pain, effusions
  - Pathophysiology: Likely autoimmune
  - Treatment: NSAIDs, steroids for severe cases

- **Reocclusion of the Artery**
  - Occurrence: Minor overall; significant post-fibrinolytic therapy
  - Risk factors: Diabetes, previous MI
  - Treatment: ACS pathway

- **[[msra/Cardiovascular/Angina|Angina]]**
  - Timing: Few hours to 30 days post-MI
  - Common in: NSTEMI patients and those treated with fibrinolytics

- **Heart Failure**
  - Prognosis: Poor
  - Common cause: Myocardial damage; can also arise from arrhythmia or mechanical complications

- **Ventricular Septal Rupture/Free Wall Rupture**
  - Onset: 2-7 days post-MI
  - Mortality: >90%
  - Risk Factors: Age, female gender, anterior infarction, etc.
  - Presentation: New pansystolic murmur, hemodynamic instability (for VSR)
  - Diagnosis: Transoesophageal echocardiography
  - Treatment: Urgent surgical repair (for VSR), emergency pericardiocentesis and surgery (for free wall rupture)

- **Acute [[Mitral Regurgitation]]**
  - Common with: Infero-posterior infarction
  - Prognosis: Poor but may be transient/asymptomatic

#### Non-Cardiac Complications

- **Depression**
  - Occurrence: Significant in ~20% of patients
  - Risks: Increased suicide risk post-MI
  - Management: Refer for therapies or antidepressant treatment

### Management

#### Prescribing

- **Antiplatelet Agents:** Low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel or ticagrelor
- **Beta-Blockers:** Start within hours post-MI
- **ACE Inhibitors**
- **Cholesterol-lowering Agents:** Statins
- **Aldosterone Antagonist:** Eplerenone for severe left ventricular dysfunction (unless contraindicated)

#### Non-Prescribing

- **Driving**
  - Ordinary License: No DVLA notification needed if treated with angioplasty; can drive after 1 week if:
    - No urgent revascularization planned
    - LVEF ≥ 40% at discharge
    - No other disqualifying conditions
  - If not treated with angioplasty, can drive after 4 weeks
  
- **Employment**
  - Return to work: Typically within 3 months; up to 6 months for CABG or cardiac arrest
