## Mitral Stenosis Overview

### Definition
- Narrowing of the mitral valve space due to thickening or fusion of leaflets.

### Causes
- **Most Common**: Rheumatic fever (95% of cases)
- **Rarer Causes**:
  - Age-related calcification
  - Congenital deformity
  - Carcinoid syndrome
  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
  - Amyloidosis
  - Drug use

### Diagnosis
- **Asymptomatic in Mild Cases**: Symptoms arise when blood flow to the left ventricle is severely reduced.
- **Symptoms of Left Heart Failure (LHF)**:
  - **Dyspnoea**: Gradually increasing shortness of breath on exertion.
  - **Orthopnoea**: Difficulty breathing when lying flat.
  - **Paroxysmal Nocturnal Dyspnoea**: Nighttime breathlessness or coughing.
  - **Palpitations**: Increased heart rate, potential irregularity.
  - **Haemoptysis**: Cough with frothy pink sputum.

- **Symptoms of Right Heart Failure (RHF)**:
  - Peripheral oedema.

### Examination Findings
- Malar flush
- Murmur: Mid-diastolic, "rumbling", best at apex (left 5th intercostal space, midclavicular line), accentuated with handgrip, associated with loud S1.
- Tapping apex beat.
- Signs of LHF:
  - Irregularly irregular pulse ([[atrial fibrillation]]).
  - Coarse end-inspiratory crackles.
  - Loud P2.
- Signs of RHF:
  - Pitting oedema.
  - Ascites.
  - Raised JVP.

### Investigations
- **ECG**: Possible findings include:
  - Irregularly irregular rhythm ([[atrial fibrillation]]).
  - P mitrale (bifid P waves).
  - Right axis deviation and RVH markers.
- **Chest X-ray**: 
  - Signs of pulmonary oedema.
  - Left atrial enlargement.
  - Mitral valve calcification.
- **Transthoracic Echocardiography**: 
  - Diagnose mitral stenosis.
  - Measure mitral orifice area and pulmonary artery pressure.
- **Other Tests**:
  - **Transoesophageal Echocardiography**: If unclear diagnosis or valvotomy planned.
  - **Cardiac Catheterisation**: If more information needed or surgery planned.
  - **Dynamic Exercise Testing**: To gauge surgical intervention necessity in severe symptoms.

### Management
#### Prescribing
- **Diuretics**: First-line for mild symptoms (e.g., furosemide, bumetanide).
- **Surgical Intervention**: Required for severe symptoms (e.g., valve repair), with anticoagulation post-surgery (warfarin, target INR 2-3).

#### Non-Prescribing
- **Asymptomatic**: No therapy if gradient <5mmHg and valve area >1.5cm².
- **Asymptomatic Severe**: Percutaneous balloon mitral valvotomy if:
  - Valve area <1.0 cm² + favorable anatomy.
  - Valve area <1.0 cm² + [[atrial fibrillation]].
  - Pulmonary hypertension.
- **Symptomatic Severe**: Intervention needed (adjunct to diuretics).
  - Grading (1 to 4: 1 being most anatomical):
    - Valve mobility
    - Calcification
    - Leaflet thickening
    - Subvalvular apparatus

**Repair Options**:
- **Percutaneous Balloon Mitral Valvotomy**: For scores <9, also for non-surgical candidates.
- **Open Valve Replacement**: Preferred for scores >9; mechanical vs. prosthetic valves considerations.
- **Valve Repair (Open Valve Commissurotomy)**: Less commonly used.

### Monitoring
- Annual monitoring to ensure symptom resolution.
