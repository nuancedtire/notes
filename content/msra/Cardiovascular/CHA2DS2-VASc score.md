The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a risk stratification tool for patients with [[atrial fibrillation]] (AF) to estimate the risk of thromboembolic events, primarily ischaemic stroke. The score is calculated based on various risk factors, helping to determine the need for oral anticoagulation (OAC).

### Diagnosis
- **CHA2DS2-VASc Score Interpretation**:
  - **≥2**: High risk of stroke (requires OAC)
  - **1** (males): Moderate risk (consider OAC)
  - **1** (females): Low risk
  - **0** (males): Low risk

**Table 1: CHA2DS2-VASc Risk Factors**
| Risk Factor | Score |
| --- | --- |
| C: Congestive heart failure or Left ventricular dysfunction | 1 |
| H: Hypertension | 1 |
| A: Age ≥75 years | 2 |
| D: Diabetes mellitus | 1 |
| S: Stroke, TIA or thromboembolism | 2 |
| V: Vascular disease | 1 |
| A: Age 65-74 years | 1 |
| S: Sex category (female) | 1 |
| **Maximum Score** | **9** |

### Investigations
Investigation is not required to calculate the score but may include:
- **Blood tests**: FBC, urea/electrolytes, thyroid function tests, glucose
- **ECG**: Check for ischaemic heart disease
- **Transthoracic echocardiography**: Assess structural/functional heart disease
- **Chest X-ray**: Check for chest infection/lung cancer

### Management (Prescribing)
OACs reduce thromboembolic risk by about two-thirds. The treatment recommendation based on stroke risk includes:
- **OAC Therapy**: Recommended for CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2
- **Consider OAC for male with score 1**
- **Antithrombotic options**:
  - Vitamin K antagonists (e.g., warfarin)
  - Non-VKA OACs (e.g., dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban)
  - **Avoid** aspirin/clopidogrel for routine stroke risk reduction

**Table 2: Stroke Risk Stratification**
| CHA2DS2-VASc Score | Ischaemic Stroke Rate | Risk | Management Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0.2% | Low (male) | No antithrombotic therapy |
| 1 | 0.6% | Low (female) Moderate (male) | Consider OAC |
| ≥2 | ≥2.2% | High | OAC |

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Recalculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score at least annually.
- Monitor patients on warfarin or NOACs systematically (INR, renal/liver function, FBC).
- Left atrial surgical ablation is an option for some cases, typically during other cardiothoracic surgeries.
