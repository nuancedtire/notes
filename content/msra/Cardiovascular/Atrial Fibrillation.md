### Atrial Fibrillation Overview
- **Definition**: AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia characterized by an irregularly irregular pulse and loss of association between cardiac apex beat and radial pulsation.
- **Complications**:
  - Blood stagnation in atria can lead to thrombus formation, increasing stroke risk.
  - Reduced cardiac output during exertion may contribute to heart failure.

### Categorising AF
- **Acute**: Onset within 48 hours.
- **Paroxysmal**: Spontaneous termination within 7 days; may progress to sustained AF.
- **Recurrent**: Multiple episodes; can be paroxysmal or persistent.
- **Persistent**: Lasting longer than 7 days or prior cardioversion.
- **Permanent**: AF lasting over a year that cannot be terminated by cardioversion.

### Diagnosis
- **Prevalence**: More common in males; ~3% of adults. Higher in older adults and those with comorbidities (e.g., hypertension, heart failure).
  
#### History
- Key history to gather includes cardiovascular risk factors, medical history, and family history.
- **Common Causes**: Coronary heart disease, hypertension, valvular heart disease, hyperthyroidism.
- **Less Common Causes**: Various cardiac and non-cardiac factors, including structural heart diseases and electrolyte imbalances.
- **Lone AF**: Occurs in up to 11% without evident cause.

#### Signs and Symptoms
- Dyspnoea
- [[Chest pain]]
- TIA/stroke
- Syncope
- Dizziness
- Palpitations

### Investigations
- **ECG**: Key for diagnosis; can reveal irregular pulse.
  - Monitor for paroxysmal AF using 24-hour ambulatory ECG if necessary.
- **Blood Tests**: TFTs, FBC, renal function, electrolytes, LFTs, coagulation screen.
- **Chest X-ray**: To check for structural cardiac issues.
- **Echocardiography**:
  - TTE for baseline management.
  - TOE for abnormalities or cardioversion planning.
- **CT/MRI**: If stroke or TIA is suspected.
- **Scoring**:
  - **CHA2DS2-VASc**: Stroke risk stratification.
  - **HAS-BLED**: Bleeding risk assessment.

### Management (Prescribing)
- Focus on controlling AF and thromboprophylaxis.
  
#### Anticoagulation
- Options: Apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, warfarin.
- Recommended for [[CHA2DS2-VASc score]] of 2 or more.

#### Rate Control
- First-line for most patients; exceptions include reversible causes or new-onset AF.
- Agents: beta-blockers (except sotalol), rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers, digoxin in sedentary patients.

#### Rhythm Control
- Consider pharmacological and/or electrical options for persistent symptoms post-rate control.

#### Cardioversion
- Offer electrical cardioversion for AF >48 hours.
- Use amiodarone for maintenance post-cardioversion.

#### Drug Treatment for Long-term Rhythm Control
- First-line: standard beta-blockers unless contraindicated.
- Assess alternatives based on individual patient profiles.

### Management (Non-prescribing)
#### Referrals
- Refer if symptoms controlled poorly or if urgent management needed (e.g., fast AF, loss of consciousness).
  
#### Lifestyle Changes
- Smoking cessation.
- Moderation in alcohol and caffeine.

#### Left Atrial Ablation
- Consider if drug treatment fails; suitable for paroxysmal/persistent AF.

#### PACE and ABLATE
- Assess for AV node ablation in permanent AF with symptoms or left ventricular dysfunction.

### Management of Acute AF
#### Rate and Rhythm Control
- Emergency electrical cardioversion for haemodynamic instability.
- Medication: flecainide or amiodarone based on structural heart disease evidence.

#### Anticoagulation
- Initiate heparin without prior anticoagulation for new-onset AF.
