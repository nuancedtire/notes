Heart failure (HF) is characterized by inadequate cardiac output for metabolic demand and/or elevated intracardiac pressures, caused by structural and functional abnormalities. It affects 1-3% of the adult population in developed countries and over 10% of people >70 years. HF can be acute or chronic and is classified based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as:

- HFrEF (LVEF <40%)
- HFpEF (LVEF ≥50%)

### Diagnosis

**Symptoms and Signs:**
- Often non-specific; require objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction at rest for diagnosis.

**Framingham Criteria:** 
Requires 2 major criteria or 1 major and 2 minor criteria for diagnosis.

| Major criteria                   | Minor criteria                       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Acute pulmonary edema             | Ankle edema                         |
| Cardiomegaly                      | Dyspnea on exertion                 |
| Hepatojugular reflux              | Hepatomegaly                       |
| Neck vein distention              | Nocturnal cough                     |
| Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea     | Pleural effusion                    |
| Pulmonary rales                   | Tachycardia (HR >120)               |
| Third heart sound (S3 gallop)    |                                     |
| Weight loss >4.5 kg in 5 days    |                                     |

**NYHA Functional Classification:**

1. No symptoms during everyday activities
2. Mild symptoms with small decrease in exercise tolerance
3. Severe symptoms, significant decrease in exercise tolerance, comfortable at rest
4. Symptoms at rest, severe limitations

### Investigations

- Clinical history, physical examination, ECG; if abnormal, natriuretic peptides serum levels or echocardiography.
- Refer patients with NT‑proBNP levels between 400-2000 ng/litre for specialist assessment and echocardiography.
- Echocardiography to assess LVEF and underlying cause.
- Other tests: FBC, U&E;, stress ECHO, CXR, CMR, endomyocardial biopsy.

### Management of Emergencies

Acute heart failure involves new or worsening symptoms and requires urgent diagnosis and treatment. Possible triggers include:

- [[Acute coronary syndrome]]
- Arrhythmias
- Metabolic disorders
- Drugs
- Pulmonary embolism

Patients may require circulatory and ventilatory support based on etiology.

### Management (Prescribing)

**HFrEF (LVEF <40%):**

- **ACEI:** For all symptomatic patients; reduces mortality and morbidity.
- **Beta-blockers:** For stable symptomatic patients; start low and titrate; reduces hospitalization and death. Use ARBs if ACEI is not tolerated.
- **Mineralocorticoid antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone):** For symptomatic patients despite maximum ACEI and beta-blocker doses.
- **ARNI:** Consider if symptomatic on ACEI/ARB + beta-blocker + MRA.
- **Calcium channel blockers (Ivabradine):** For resistant symptoms with sinus rhythm ≥70 bpm.
- **CRT (cardiac resynchronization therapy):** For patients with sinus rhythm and QRS ≥130 msec.
- **Other Considerations:** Digoxin, hydralazine, isosorbide dinitrate, left ventricular assist device, heart transplant for resistant symptoms with LVEF ≤35%.
- **Diuretics:** To achieve and maintain euvolaemia; start with lowest dose.
- **Oral anticoagulants:** Not recommended unless for [[atrial fibrillation]].
- **Contraindications:** Ca2+-blockers, glitazones, NSAIDs, COX-2-inhibitors.

**HFpEF or Midrange Ejection Fraction (LVEF ≥40%):**

- **Diuretics:** For congestion management.
- **Comorbidities:** Screening and management.
- **ACEIs, ARBs, beta-blockers, MRAs:** Not proven to reduce mortality, but can help manage comorbidities.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

**Patient Education on Lifestyle Changes:**

- Regular aerobic exercise
- Low-sodium diet (<6g/day)
- Maintain or reduce weight if overweight/obese
- Stop smoking and recreational drug use
- Limit alcohol intake
- Avoid excessive fluid intake

**Vaccination:** Annual influenza and one-off pneumococcal vaccination recommended for all HF patients.
