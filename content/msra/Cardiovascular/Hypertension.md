Hypertension Overview
====================

- Defined as SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg.
- Major risk factor for cardiovascular events (50% of CV deaths).
- Primary Hypertension: 95% (unknown cause; complex genetics/environment).
- Secondary Hypertension: 5% (common cause: renal disease).

Causes of Secondary Hypertension
-------------------------------

- **Renal Disease**: 
  - Glomerulonephritis (most common)
  - Polyarteritis nodosa
  - Systemic sclerosis
  - Chronic pyelonephritis
  - Polycystic kidneys
  - Renovascular disease ([[atherosclerosis]], fibromuscular dysplasia)

- **Endocrine Disease**:
  - Primary aldosteronism (most common)
  - Cushing’s syndrome
  - Phaeochromocytoma
  - Acromegaly
  - Hyperparathyroidism

- **Other Causes**:
  - Pregnancy
  - Drugs: steroids, MAOI, oral contraceptives, cocaine, amphetamines

Risk Factors
------------

- Age
- Smoking
- Obesity
- High sodium & low potassium diet
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- Lack of physical activity
- Chronic conditions (e.g., sleep apnoea, kidney disease, diabetes)
- Pregnancy

Diagnosis
---------

- Most patients are asymptomatic; diagnosed during screenings.
- Possible symptoms: headaches, sleep disturbances, light-headedness, vertigo, tinnitus.
- Confirm diagnosis via ABPM or HBPM if clinic pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg.
- Diagnosis confirmed if ABPM/HBPM average ≥ 135/85 mmHg.

Blood Pressure Measurement Guidelines
-------------------------------------

- Cuff width > 40% arm circumference
- Cuff secured tightly
- Arm outstretched at heart level
- Measure BP on both arms
- Avoid automated devices if pulse irregularity is present

Investigations
---------------

- Exclude secondary causes before diagnosing hypertension.
- Screen for end-organ damage & assess cardiovascular risk.

Important Tests:
- ECG/ECHO (check for left ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial infarction)
- Urine analysis (proteinuria, blood, meta-adrenaline, free cortisol)
- Renal ultrasound/arteriography (renal artery stenosis)
- U&E (hypokalaemia, hypercalcemia)
- Ophthalmoscopy (retinopathy)
- Serum cholesterol, HDL, LDL, fasting glucose

Hypertensive Emergencies
------------------------

- Malignant hypertension: BP ≥ 180/120 mmHg with end-organ failure.
- Presenting symptoms: retinal hemorrhage, papilloedema.
- Management: 
  - Reduce BP slowly; max 20% in the first hour, 5-15% in the next 24h. 
  - Use oral medications primarily; IV options for encephalopathy or cardiac failure.
  - Contraindication of sublingual nifedipine due to stroke risk.

Management (Prescribing)
------------------------

- Target BP: < 140/90 mmHg, < 130/80 mmHg for diabetes, 150/90 mmHg for >80 years.

**Monotherapy:**
- ≥ 55 years / Black: CCB (e.g., nifedipine) or thiazides (e.g., chlortalidone)
- < 55 years with comorbidities: ACEI (e.g., lisinopril) or ARB (e.g., candesartan)
- Women of childbearing potential: Beta-blockers (e.g., bisoprolol), if ACEI/ARB not tolerated.

**Multi-drug Therapy:**
- If uncontrolled: 
  - Start with ACEI or ARB + CCB/thiazide. 
  - Further add more drugs as needed.

Management (Non-Prescribing)
-----------------------------

- Lifestyle changes:
  - Stop smoking
  - Reduce alcohol intake
  - Low-fat, low-sodium, high-potassium diet
  - Increase physical activity
  - Weight reduction if overweight

- Lifestyle advice is crucial for all patients. It can manage stage 1 hypertension without medication in some cases.
