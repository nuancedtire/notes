Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvular disease affecting approximately 2.4% of the US population. It is characterized by the bulging of the mitral valve leaflet(s) into the left atrium during systole. While most patients remain asymptomatic, they can experience complications such as [[mitral regurgitation]], [[infective endocarditis]], and sudden cardiac death.

## Diagnosis

### Risk Factors
- Connective tissue disorders (Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, pseudoxanthoma elasticum)
- Family history of MVP
- Thin physique

### Symptoms
Patients are often asymptomatic but may present with:
- Palpitations
- Syncope
- Atypical [[chest pain]]
- Anxiety

### Auscultation Findings
- Mid-systolic click
- Late systolic murmur (medium to high pitched, varying in length)
- Click and murmur timing influenced by:
  - Decreased preload (e.g., standing, Valsalva) → earlier systole
  - Increased preload (e.g., squatting) → later systole
  - Increased afterload (e.g., amyl nitrate) → earlier systole
  - Decreased afterload (e.g., handgrip) → later systole
  
## Investigations
- **Echocardiogram:** Diagnostic; shows prolapse of leaflet >2mm above annulus in systole (long-axis parasternal or apical view, 2D imaging).
- **Holter/ambulatory monitoring:** Indicated for patients with palpitations or syncope to assess for arrhythmias.

## Management (Prescribing)

### Asymptomatic Patients
- No specific treatment needed.

### Aspirin (75-300mg orally once daily) for:
- [[Atrial fibrillation]]
- Ischaemic stroke
- History of transient ischaemic attack
- Post-operative period after mitral valve repair

### Warfarin (2-10mg orally OD, optimizing INR 2-3) for:
- Previous systemic embolism
- [[Atrial fibrillation]] (including post-operative)

### Beta-blockers
- May alleviate symptoms of palpitations, anxiety, or atypical [[chest pain]].

### Medical Therapy for Severe [[Mitral Regurgitation]] (not for surgery):
- Digoxin
- Vasodilators
- Angiotensin blockers
- Diuretics

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Avoid stress, stimulants (caffeine, nicotine), and alcohol for patients with palpitations.

### Surgical Considerations
- **Mitral valve repair** indicated for:
  - Severe [[mitral regurgitation]] with left ventricular dysfunction
  - Pulmonary hypertension
  - [[Atrial fibrillation]]

### Alternative Treatments
- **Percutaneous mitral valve repair:** Considered for those unfit for surgery or with severe [[mitral regurgitation]] resistant to medical treatment.
