- **Aortic Valve**: Consists of three thin ‘cusps’; located between the left ventricle and the aorta.
- **Aortic Regurgitation**: Insufficient aortic valve allowing backflow of blood during diastole; can result in left ventricle enlargement.

### Diagnosis
- **Causes**:
  - Bicuspid aortic valve (congenital)
  - [[Rheumatic Fever]]
  - [[Infective Endocarditis]]
  - Collagen valvular diseases
  - Degenerative aortic valve disease
  
- **Increased Risk Factors**: 
  - History of aortic dissection
  - [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)]]
  - [[Marfan's Syndrome]]
  - Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
  - Turner syndrome
  - Ankylosing spondylitis
  - Reactive arthritis
  - Takayasu’s disease
  - Behcet’s disease

- **Epidemiology**:
  - Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause globally.
  - In developed countries: congenital and degenerative issues predominate.
  - Peak presentation age: 40-60 years; majority do not have severe disease.

- **Symptoms**:
  - Fatigue
  - Shortness of breath
  - Peripheral edema
  - Anginal [[chest pain]]

- **Signs**:
  - Soft S1
  - Diastolic murmur (best heard in aortic area, patient sitting forward, expiration)
  - Exaggerated arterial pulsations
  - Low diastolic pressure, wide pulse pressure
  - Corrigan pulse, head bobbing, bisferiens pulse (rare in UK)
  - Complete aortic valve collapse may produce "a cooing dove" sound; urgent valve replacement needed.

### Investigations
- Full 12-lead ECG
- Chest X-ray (may show heart failure signs)
- Echocardiography (key for quantifying regurgitation severity)
- Cardiac magnetic resonance (for Marfan’s or aortic enlargement detection)
- Cardiac catheterization (assess anatomy before surgery)

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Short-term**: Vasodilators, inotropes for severe heart failure before surgery.
- **Long-term**: 
  - ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-II antagonists for chronic severe regurgitation.
  - Beta-blockers in Marfan’s syndrome to slow aortic root dilatation.

### Management (Non-prescribing)
- Annual review for mild-moderate cases, echocardiography every 2 years.
- Increase frequency for significant changes.
- Valve replacement for symptomatic patients or those with deteriorating left ventricular function; valve repairs more common in experienced centers.
- Valve-sparing replacement for combined aortic root dilatation and valve regurgitation.
- Mortality from surgeries: low (1-4%), increases with age, reduced LV function.
