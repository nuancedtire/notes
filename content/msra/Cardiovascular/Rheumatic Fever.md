## Overview
- **Incidence**: Reduced in developed countries due to penicillin, lower pathogen virulence, better social conditions; remains high in developing countries.
- **Pathogenesis**: Immune hypersensitivity to group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus; affects joints, skin, heart, nervous system.
- **Genetic Susceptibility**: 44% monozygotic twin concordance.
- **Mortality**: Responsible for ~233,000 deaths annually.

## Diagnosis
- **Incidence**: Less than 1 per 100,000 in high-income countries, highest in school-aged children.
  
### History
- **Risk Factors**: Young age, overcrowding, poor hygiene, limited medical access.
- **Infection Sources**: Skin infections in hotter countries, pharyngitis in developed countries.

### Symptoms
- Appear 3 weeks post-sore throat; shorter in recurrent cases.

### Diagnostic Criteria (Jones Criteria)
- **Evidence of Recent Infection**: History of scarlet fever, + throat swab/rising antistreptolysin.
- **Criteria**: 2 major OR 1 major + 2 minor.

#### Major Criteria
1. **Arthritis**: Migratory arthritis in large joints; NSAIDs recommended.
2. **Carditis**: 
   - Occurs in 40% of patients.
   - Can lead to valvular heart disease.
   - Symptoms: Tachycardia, pericardial rub, [[aortic regurgitation]], mitral valve involvement.
3. **Chorea**: 
   - 10-30% of patients; typically in children 7-12.
   - Symptoms: Rapid, random movements.
4. **Subcutaneous Nodules**: 10% occurrence; over extensor surfaces.
5. **Erythema Marginatum**: 
   - 5-15% occurrence; rash on trunk and proximal limbs, not on face. 

#### Minor Criteria
- Fever (90% of patients), usually >39Â°C.
- Elevated ESR and serum CRP.
- Arthralgia (not if arthritic).
- Prolonged PR on ECG (not if carditic).

## Investigations
- **Throat Swabs**: May come back negative when symptoms appear.
- **Antistreptococcal Antibodies**: Important for chorea cases, assess two weeks apart.
   - Common antibodies: ASO, anti-DNase B.
   - ASO peaks 2-3 weeks after onset (sensitivity 80-85%); anti-DNase B sensitivity 90%.
- **ECG**: Prolonged PR interval; bradycardia in some cases.
- **Chest X-Ray**: Signs of heart failure.
- **Doppler ECHO**: Sensitive for detection of carditis.

## Management 

### Prescribing
- **Antibiotics**: Penicillin (or erythromycin/cephalosporin if allergic).
- **Recurrent Pharyngitis**: Second round of penicillin; oral clindamycin recommended.
- **Pain Relief**: Naproxen for arthritis; avoid high-dose aspirin due to Reye's syndrome.
- **Heart Failure**: Diuretics, ACE inhibitors, digoxin.
- **Chorea**: Diazepam or haloperidol (caution with extrapyramidal effects).

### Non-Prescribing
- **Cardiac Surgery**: Consider mitral valve replacement if medical management fails.
- **Secondary Prevention**: Long-term antibiotic regimen to prevent infections. Duration of prophylaxis debated.
