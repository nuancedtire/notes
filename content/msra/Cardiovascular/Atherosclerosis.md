Atheroembolic disease involves the abnormal release of cholesterol crystals into the bloodstream, leading to ischaemic disease, particularly affecting the kidneys, skin, gastrointestinal system, and brain.

### Diagnosis
Atheroembolic disease can occur after:
- **Physical interventions** (e.g., catheterisation, vascular surgery):
  - Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (CABG)
  - Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair
  - Angiography
  - Angioplasty
  - Endovascular grafting

- **Spontaneous events** or following anticoagulation medication, which can disrupt cholesterol plaques:
  - Warfarin
  - Heparin
  - Antiplatelet agents
  - Thrombolytic therapy

**Risk Factors** align with atherosclerosis:
- Increasing age
- Male gender
- Hypertension
- Hyperlipidaemia
- Smoking
- Diabetes

Patients often have co-morbidities, including:
- Coronary artery disease
- Heart failure
- Cerebrovascular disease
- Renal disease
- Aortic aneurysm

#### Signs and Symptoms
Typically affects:
- Kidneys
- Brain
- Lower skeletal muscles
- Gastrointestinal tract

Common signs and symptoms include:
- Livedo reticularis
- Blue/purple toe syndrome
- Abdominal pain
- New neurological deficit

#### Atheroembolic Renal Disease (AERD)
Forms of AERD:
1. **Acute** – develops days after a triggering event due to massive embolisation
2. **Subacute** – recurrent embolisation or inflammation post-initial insult; most common
3. **Chronic and slowly progressive** – may mimic nephrosclerosis or ischaemic nephropathy

### Investigations
Potential presentations include:
- Haematuria
- Moderate proteinuria
- Accelerated or new-onset hypertension

Other findings:
- Eosinophilia
- Hypercomplementaemia
- Eosinophiluria

Diagnosis is often clinical based on:
- Triggering event
- Renal failure
- Signs of peripheral emboli

**Renal biopsy** may be needed to rule out:
- Vasculitis
- Allergic interstitial nephritis
- Acute tubular necrosis

**Skin or muscle biopsies** may assist in diagnosis if lesions are present.

### Management (prescribing)
- No specific medical therapy; treatment is supportive.
- Discontinue anticoagulation in diagnosed AERD.
- Manage atherosclerosis with:
  - Aspirin
  - Statins
  - Antihypertensives
  - Glycaemic control

### Management (non-prescribing)
- **Dialysis** if no ongoing embolic events.
- Delay or cancel further invasive procedures if symptoms persist.
- **Smoking cessation** is crucial for managing atherosclerotic risks.
