### Subclavian Steal Syndrome Overview
- **Definition**: A condition caused by a proximal stenosing lesion or occlusion in the subclavian artery, leading to syncope or neurological deficits.
- **Mechanism**: Increased blood supply demand in the arm during exercise draws blood from collateral circulation, causing reversed flow in the ipsilateral vertebral artery.
- **Symptoms**: Commonly presents with arm claudication; neurological symptoms are less common due to collateral supply from the contralateral vertebral artery.

### Risk Factors
- **Associated with [[atherosclerosis]]**:
  - Hypertension
  - Diabetes
  - Smoking
  - Older age

### Investigations
1. **Initial Investigation**: Duplex ultrasound (US) scan showing retrograde flow in the affected vertebral artery during exercise.
2. **Definitive Investigation**: 
   - CT or MR angiography to identify occlusive lesion anatomy and assess cerebral vasculature (80% have additional vascular disease).
3. **Other Assessment**: Chest radiograph to check for external compression on the subclavian artery.

### Treatment
- **Cardiovascular Risk Management**: Address contributing risk factors.
- **Surgical Options**: 
  - Endovascular techniques 
  - Bypass procedures
