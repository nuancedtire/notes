## Gestational Hypertension (GHTN)

### Definition
- Hypertensive disorder occurring at ≥20 weeks of gestation, resolving postpartum.
- Affects 6-17% of first-time mothers and 2-4% of multiparous women.

### Risk Factors
- **Obesity**: BMI >30 or pregnancy BMI >25
- **Age**: <20 years or >40 years
- **Medical History**: Diabetes, chronic/gestational hypertension, chronic renal disease
- **Autoimmune Disorders**: SLE, antiphospholipid syndrome
- **Family History**: Pre-eclampsia
- **Pregnancy**: First pregnancy, multifetal pregnancy
- **Past Complications**: Insufficient placenta-related issues (e.g., stillbirth, fetal growth restriction)

### Diagnosis Criteria
- Systolic BP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg AND:
  - Absence of chronic hypertension prior to pregnancy
  - At least two BP readings, 4-6 hours apart
  - First onset of hypertension ≥20 weeks pregnancy
  - Absence of proteinuria (<300mg in 24-hour urine collection)
  - Absence of new-onset end-organ failure

- Severe GHTN: 
  - Systolic BP ≥160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP ≥110 mmHg.

- Convert to chronic hypertension if elevated BP persists ≥12 weeks postpartum.

### Investigations
- **Medical History**: Risk factors and pre-pregnancy BP
- **Blood Pressure Readings**: Twice, 4-6 hours apart; home monitoring for white coat syndrome.
- **Urinary Protein Excretion**: 24-hour urine collection or protein-to-creatinine ratio preferred over dipstick method.
- **Physical Examination**: Check for end-organ dysfunction symptoms (CNS, liver, renal).
- **Laboratory Tests**: Liver function tests, full blood count, serum creatinine.
- **Fetal Assessment**: Biophysical profile or non-stress test with amniotic fluid estimation.

### Management

#### Prescribing
- **Indications for Antihypertensive Treatment**: BP persistently >140/90 mmHg; all with severe GHTN (>160/110 mmHg) should be treated.
- **First-Line Treatment**: Labetalol.
- **Alternative Options**: Nifedipine (if labetalol not suitable) or Methyldopa (if neither labetalol nor nifedipine suitable).

#### Non-Prescribing
- **Patient Education**: Inform about progression signs to pre-eclampsia and fetal well-being assessment.
- **Activity Recommendations**: Short bed rest possibly; prolonged bed rest is not recommended.
- **Delivery Timing**: 
  - Uncomplicated pregnancies with mild GHTN: Deliver at term (38+0 to 39+6 weeks).
  - Severe GHTN with comorbidities: Deliver at 37+0 weeks.
