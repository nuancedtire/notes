### Mitral Regurgitation (MR)

#### Definition
- Backflow of blood through an incompetent mitral valve from the left ventricle to the left atrium.
  
#### Types
- **Acute MR**: Caused by:
  - [[Infective endocarditis]]
  - Papillary muscle dysfunction
  - Rheumatic fever
  - Acute left ventricular dilatation (ischemia)
  
- **Chronic MR**: Caused by:
  - Mitral valve prolapse (MVP)
  - Thickening and elongation of the mitral apparatus (connective tissue disorders)

### Diagnosis

#### Symptoms
- **Asymptomatic** in mild MR
- Symptoms indicative of left heart failure (LHF):
  - Gradually increasing **dyspnoea** (shortness of breath)
  - **Orthopnoea** (shortness of breath when lying flat)
  - **Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea** (nighttime coughing/shortness of breath)
  - **Palpitations**
  - **Haemoptysis** (cough with frothy pink sputum)
  - **Fatigue**

#### Progression
- Worsening LHF can lead to right heart failure (RHF) due to pulmonary hypertension.
- **RHF Symptoms**:
  - **Peripheral oedema**

#### Physical Exam Findings
- **Murmur**: Pansystolic, best at the apex (5th left intercostal space, mid-clavicular line), radiating to the axilla.
- **Displaced apex** in chronic MR (laterally located).
- Signs of LHF:
  - Irregularly irregular pulse ([[atrial fibrillation]])
  - Coarse end-inspiratory crackles (pulmonary edema)
  - Loud P2 (pulmonary hypertension)
- Signs of RHF:
  - Pitting edema in lower limbs/sacrum
  - Ascites
  - Raised JVP 

### Investigations
- **ECG**:
  - Irregularly irregular rhythm ([[atrial fibrillation]], absence of P waves)
  - P mitrale (bifid/M-shaped P waves, left atrial enlargement)
  - Left ventricular hypertrophy signs
  
- **Transthoracic echocardiography**:
  - Diagnose and assess severity of MR
  
- **Transoesophageal echocardiography**:
  - Indicated if diagnosis is unclear.
  
- **Cardiac catheterization**:
  - Check [[coronary artery disease]] risks.
  - Assess pulmonary hypertension.

### Management (Pharmacological)
- **Medications**:
  - ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, lisinopril)
  - Beta-blockers (metoprolol, atenolol, nadolol)
  
- **Indications for treatment**:
  - Asymptomatic with LVEF >60% or LVESD <45mm
  - Symptomatic
  
- **Diuretics** (e.g., furosemide, indapamide) to reduce afterload in symptomatic patients.

- **Post-surgery**:
  - Anticoagulation (warfarin) for six weeks, monitoring INR (target 2.5-3.5).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Surgical options**:
  - Valve repair (valvuloplasty, annuloplasty)
  - Valve replacement:
    - Mechanical valves: durable, associated with lifelong anticoagulation and bleeding risks.
    - Prosthetic valves: less need for lifelong anticoagulation (often only 3 months), less robust, possible repeat replacement.
  - Emerging percutaneous options.

- **Indications for surgery**:
  - Asymptomatic with LVEF ≤60% or LVESD ≥45mm
  - Symptomatic
  
- **Exclusions**:
  - Not recommended for symptomatic MR with LVEF <30%. Consider intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation.

- **Post-operative follow-up**:
  - Follow-up at 3-4 weeks with a baseline echo, then annually to monitor symptoms.
