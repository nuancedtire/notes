### Angina Pectoris Overview
- **Definition**: Cardiac [[chest pain]] due to insufficient blood supply via narrowed coronary arteries.
- **Types**: 
  - **Stable Angina**: [[Chest pain]] on exertion, dissipates with rest.
  - **Unstable Angina**: [[Chest pain]] at rest, may be persistent; considered a medical emergency ([[Acute coronary syndrome]], ACS).
  
### Diagnosis
- **Prevalence**: 
  - 8% of men, 3% of women have or had angina.
  - Higher prevalence in older age and South Asian origin in the UK.
  - Increased rates in lower socio-economic groups.
  
#### History
- **Risk Factors**: 
  - Family history, male gender, age, smoking, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, [[Familial hypercholesterolaemia]], [[msra/Cardiovascular/Hypertension|Hypertension]], [[Obesity]], inactivity, poor diet.
- **Cardiac History**: Previous angina, [[Acute coronary syndrome]], coronary interventions.
- **Cardiac Abnormalities**: [[Aortic Stenosis]], hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

#### Symptoms
- **Common Symptoms**: 
  - Central ‘tight’ or ‘crushing’ [[chest pain]].
  - Pain radiating to jaw, arms, shoulders, neck.
  
- **ACS/Unstable Angina Symptoms**: 
  - Clamminess, sweatiness, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, prolonged pain (>15 min), pain increases despite rest or treatment.
  
- **Stable Angina Relief**: May be relieved by sublingual Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN).

#### Prinzmetal Angina
- Occurs at rest, often in morning; caused by coronary artery vasospasm. Lifestyle management is key.

#### Silent Myocardial Infarction
- Elderly or diabetic neuropathy patients may not experience [[chest pain]] during ischemic events.

### Investigations
#### Blood Tests
- **FBC**: Exclude anemia.
- **Renal Function Tests**: Check electrolytes.
- **Diabetes Screen**: Fasting blood glucose or HbA1c.
- **Lipid Profile**: Cholesterol, triglycerides.
- **Thyroid Function Tests**: Rule out hyperthyroidism.
- **Liver Function Tests**: Before statin therapy.
- **Troponin T**: Cardiac enzyme for myocardial distress.

#### Imaging
- **[[ECG]]**: May show normal, sinus tachycardia, or ischemic changes (Q waves, bundle branch block, ST elevation/depression).
- **Echocardiography**: Cardiac function assessment.
- **Coronary Angiography**: Visualization of coronary arteries.

### Scoring
- Use **GRACE Score** for unstable angina risk assessment (morbidity/mortality). 
- Consider **TIMI Score** for further evaluation.

### Management
#### Short Term
- **Medications**:
  - Glyceryl Trinitrate (GTN).
- **MONAC Protocol**:
  - Morphine (with metoclopramide), Oxygen, Nitrates, Aspirin (300mg), Clopidogrel (300mg).

#### Antithrombin Therapy (NSTEMI/Unstable Angina)
- Fondaparinux (low bleeding risk) or unfractionated heparin (if angiography within 24 hours).

#### Long Term
- Control blood pressure and cholesterol.
- Beta-blockers to reduce attack frequency.
- GTN or oral nitrates.
- Aspirin and possible dual/triple antiplatelet therapy post-stenting.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
#### Short Term
- Urgent assessment for ACS symptoms, potential cardiology consultation.
- Confirm diagnosis via Rapid Access [[Chest Pain]] Clinic, seen within two weeks.

#### Long Term
- **Lifestyle Modifications**: Diet, exercise, stress management, smoking cessation.
- **Rehabilitation**: Cardiac rehabilitation, discharge planning.
- **Driving Restrictions**: May need to refrain from driving for 4 weeks post-ACS.
