Warfarin Overview
------------------
- **Type:** Anticoagulant medication 
- **Mechanism:** Reduces vitamin K effects, prolongs blood clotting time
- **Uses:**
  - Prevents DVTs
  - Prevents pulmonary embolisms
  - Patients with prior blood clots
  - Patients at high risk of clots (e.g., [[atrial fibrillation]], mechanical heart valves)

### INR Testing
- **Purpose:** Monitor warfarin dosage, maintain within therapeutic range, avoiding hemorrhage.
- **Monitoring Frequency:**
  - Initial 3 months: weekly
  - Afterward: every 2-6 weeks
- **Target INR Range:** 2.0 - 3.0 (ideally 2.5)

### Diagnosis for Warfarin Treatment
- **CHADSVASc Score:**
  - Score ≥ 2: anticoagulation recommended
  - Score 1 (men): consideration for treatment

| Condition | Points  
---|---
C | Congestive heart failure | 1  
H | Hypertension | 1  
A2 | Age > 75 years | 2  
D | Diabetes | 1  
S2 | Prior stroke or TIA | 2  
V | Vascular disease | 1  
A | Age 65-74 years | 1  
Sc | Female | 1  

### Indications for Warfarin
- [[Atrial fibrillation]] (AF)
- Cardioversion
- Heart valve prostheses
- Venous thromboembolism (VTE)
  - DVTs
  - Pulmonary embolism (PE)

### Contra-indications
- Previous allergic reactions to warfarin
- Pregnancy (unless breast-feeding)
- Hemorrhagic stroke
- Serious bleeding conditions
- Recent significant trauma/surgery
- Significant liver or kidney impairment
- Major bleeding disorders

### Side Effects
- Increased bleeding tendency (most common)
- Hypersensitivity
- Alopecia
- Skin necrosis (in patients with protein C/S deficiencies)
- Gastrointestinal issues (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting)
- Jaundice

### Investigations Before Warfarin Treatment
- eGFR (monitor if ≤ 60)
- Liver function tests (contra-indicated in severe impairment)
- Blood pressure assessment

### Emergency Management for Hemorrhage
- Treatment for life-threatening hemorrhage: 
  - 5-10 mg vitamin K1 intravenously
  - 30-50 units/kg dried prothrombin complex or 15 mg/kg fresh frozen plasma if prothrombin complex unavailable.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Induction Regimen:**
  - Start with heparin cover for VTE.
  - Warfarin dosing: 5 mg on days 1 and 2, adjusted based on INR.
  - [[Atrial fibrillation]]: starts with 3 mg daily for the first week.
  
- **Actions Based on INR Levels:**
  - INR > 8: Discontinue warfarin, give vitamin K1.
  - INR 5-8 (no bleed): Discontinue warfarin, consider vitamin K1 (if minor bleed).
  - Low INR: Ensure compliance, consider temporary dose increase.

### Procedures and Warfarin Management
- **High-Risk Procedures:** Discontinue 5 days prior, consider bridging therapy.
- **Low-Risk Procedures:** Continue warfarin unless INR > 3.0.

### Drug Interactions
- NSAIDs, certain antibiotics, SSRIs, and more. Consider alternatives (e.g., dabigatran, rivaroxaban) if warfarin not suitable.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Avoid certain foods/drinks: 
  - Herbal meds (pericon)
  - Alcohol
  - Juices (grapefruit, pomegranate, cranberry)
  - Foods high in vitamin K (leafy greens, chickpeas, liver)
- Advise stable diet with regular small amounts of vitamin K.
