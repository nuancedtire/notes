### Haemophilia A Overview
- Caused by deficiency in **Factor VIII**
- Affects **1 in 5000 males**
- **X-linked disorder** (Factor VIII gene on X chromosome)
- Male offspring of affected males are unaffected, daughters become carriers
- Female carriers: 
  - 50% chance sons have condition
  - 50% chance daughters are carriers
- Severity based on gene mutation type:
  - **Single-base changes:** mild-moderate disease
  - **Large deletions:** severe disease
- **Prenatal genetic testing:** chorionic villus sampling
- Rarely, female carriers may experience mild disease due to **lyonization**.

### Diagnosis
- **Severity Classification:**
  
| Severity   | Factor VIII Level      | Clinical Presentation                       |
|------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Mild**   | >0.05 to 0.4 U/mL    | Excess bleeding post-injury/surgery        |
| **Moderate**| 0.01-0.05 U/mL      | Bleeding after mild trauma/surgery        |
| **Severe**  | <0.01 U/mL           | Spontaneous bleeding; risk of intracranial hemorrhage in infants |

### Investigations
- **Testing at Birth:**
  - Boys of female carriers: check APTT and Factor VIII levels.
  - Girls: 50% chance of being carriers; tested via Factor VIII/IX assays or genetic testing.
- **Coagulation Screen:**
  - APTT raised; INR, bleeding time, platelet count normal.
- **Post-Bleeding:**
  - Rule out thrombocytopenia and check for anemia.

### Emergency Management
- Life-threatening bleeds require:
  - **ABC approach**
  - Immediate intravenous Factor VIII
  - Possible urgent specialty referral
- GI/airway bleeds: use **tranexamic acid** unless pleural extension is present.
- Provide adequate analgesia.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Mild/Moderate Haemophilia A:**
  - Treat bleeding episodes: IV infusion of Factor VIII as needed.
  - Consider antifibrinolytics (e.g., tranexamic acid), analgesia, desmopressin.
- **Severe Haemophilia A:**
  - Prophylactic Factor VIII infusions: 2-3 times/week, monitored by specialists.
  - Extended half-life Factor VIII: every 5-7 days.
  - Up to 30% may develop factor inhibitors, requiring higher and more frequent doses; referral to specialist center needed.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Patient Education:**
  - Understand condition and treatment options.
  - Action plan for uncontrolled bleeding.
  - Avoid NSAIDs and intramuscular injections; opt for subcutaneous.
  - Recommend wearing a medical alert bracelet.
  - Minimize risk of accidents/trauma; physiotherapy for joint recovery post-bleed/injury.
