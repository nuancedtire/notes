### Haematological Disorder Overview
- Unknown aetiology
- Characterised by:
  - Malignant proliferation of B-line lymphocytes
  - Reedâ€“Sternberg cells present
- Incidence peaks:
  - 15-40 years: 1st peak
  - >50 years: 2nd peak
- Gender distribution: Men (2x affected compared to women)

### Diagnosis
#### Symptoms
- Non-specific:
  - Pyrexia
  - Malaise
  - Night sweats
  - Weight loss (>10% in 6 months)
  - Pruritus
  - Lethargy
- Other:
  - Hepatosplenomegaly
  - Lymphadenopathy (60-80%):
    - Enlarged cervical & mediastinal lymph nodes
    - Less common: axillar or other nodes below diaphragm
  - Nodes usually non-tender; may be painful post-alcohol
  - Possible symptoms from node location:
    - Persistent cough
    - Pleural effusion
    - Bronchial obstruction
    - Superior/inferior vena cava syndrome

#### Staging (Ann Arbor System)
- Stage I: Single lymph node region affected
- Stage II: Two or more nodal areas on same side of diaphragm affected
- Stage III: Lymph nodes on both sides of diaphragm affected
- Stage IV: Other organs affected (e.g., liver, bone marrow)
- Subcategories:
  - A: No systemic symptoms
  - B: Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats)
  - E: Affected organs other than lymph nodes

### Investigations
- **Biopsy**:
  - Image-guided lymph node needle biopsy or surgical removal
  - Characteristic Reed-Sternberg cells
- **Blood tests**:
  - Full blood count/blood film (5-10% of patients show abnormalities):
    - Neutrophilia, eosinophilia, lymphocytopenia, low platelets, anaemia
  - Liver function tests (LFTs), LDH, alkaline phosphatase (may be increased)
  - Increased ESR, decreased haemoglobin (possibly worse prognosis)
- **Imaging**:
  - PET-CT of thorax, abdomen, pelvis
  - Chest X-ray to assess disorder extent

### Management (prescribing)
- First-line: Chemoradiotherapy
- **ABVD regimen** (Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine):
  - Effective in ~80% of stage IA-IIA patients
- Advanced cases: Higher doses of chemotherapy
- Recurrence: High-dose chemotherapy & autologous stem cell transplantation

### Management (non-prescribing)
- Surgical treatment: Not typically used
- 5-year survival rate:
  - Stage IA: ~95%
  - Stage IVB: <40%
