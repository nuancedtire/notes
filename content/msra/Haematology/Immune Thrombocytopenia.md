## Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)

### Overview
- **Definition**: Autoimmune haematological condition causing isolated thrombocytopenia (<100x10⁹/litre).
- **Subtypes**: 
  - **Primary ITP**: No clear cause.
  - **Secondary ITP**: Identifiable precipitating condition or medication.

### Demographics
- Typically affects:
  - Boys and girls <10 years
  - Men and women >65 years
  - Women of childbearing age

### Clinical Manifestations
- Symptoms range from:
  - Asymptomatic (routine finding)
  - Petechiae and mild bruising
  - Life-threatening haemorrhage

### Diagnosis
- **Approach**: Diagnosis of exclusion; requires thorough history and examination.
- **Laboratory findings**: Isolated thrombocytopenia (<100x10⁹/litre).
- **Signs/Symptoms**:
  - Petechiae
  - Bruising
  - Easy bleeding
  - Possible fatigue

### Risk Factors
- Secondary ITP associations:
  - Lymphoproliferative disorders
  - HIV
  - Hepatitis C
  - Autoimmune disorders (e.g., SLE)
- Additional risk factors:
  - Age <10 years
  - Female of childbearing age
  - Age >65 years
  - Recent viral illnesses

### Investigations
- **Key Tests**:
  - **Full Blood Count (FBC)**: Identifies isolated thrombocytopenia.
  - **Peripheral Blood Smear**: Distinguishes thrombocytopenia from pseudothrombocytopenia.
  
- **Further Investigations**: 
  - Ruling out causes of secondary ITP (HIV, Hepatitis C)
  - Bone marrow biopsy
  - TFTs (8-14% of ITP cases may show hyperthyroidism)

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Asymptomatic/minor bleeding**: Conservative management
- **For children**: Observation without intervention.
- **For adults**:
  - Severe bleeding or platelet count <30x10⁹/litre: Corticosteroids ± IVIG.
  - Platelet count >30x10⁹/litre: Observation recommended.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Severity and lab results inform management choices.
- Spontaneous remission expected in 80% of children.
- Higher mortality rates in older patients/unresponsive cases.
- Minor bleeding/asymptomatic cases: Observation.
- Chronic cases may require specialist consultation.
