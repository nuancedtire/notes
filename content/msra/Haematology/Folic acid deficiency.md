- **Folic Acid Deficiency**: Common cause of megaloblastic anaemia; affects ~5% globally. 

### **Diagnosis**
- **Causes**:
  - Insufficient dietary intake (restrictive diet, alcoholism, poverty)
  - Malabsorption (coeliac disease, Crohn's disease)
  - Increased demand (pregnancy)
  - Haemolysis
  - Inflammatory disease/malignancy
  - Renal/liver dysfunction
  - Medications (anti-epileptics, trimethoprim, methotrexate)

- **Typical Signs**:
  - Malaise
  - Pallor of mucous membranes/nail beds
  - Anorexia
  - Weight loss
  - Tachycardia
  - Mild fever
  - Mild jaundice
  - Weakness

- **Other Symptoms**:
  - Liver enlargement
  - Heart murmurs
  - Oral ulcers
  - [[msra/Cardiovascular/Angina|Angina]]
  - Skin pigmentation changes
  - Cognitive changes
  - Dyspnoea
  - Headaches
  - Indigestion

- **Differential Diagnosis**:
  - Vitamin B12 deficiency
  - Alcoholism
  - Haematological abnormalities (myelodysplasia, aplastic anaemia, etc.)
  - Chronic liver disease
  - Severe thyroid deficiency
  - Excessive smoking

### **Investigations**
- **Full Blood Count**:
  - Low haemoglobin, MCV > 100 fL, low platelet/white cell count in severe cases
- **Blood Film**:
  - Hypersegmented neutrophils, oval macrocytes
- **Serum Folate**:
  - <3 µg/L suggests deficiency
- **Red Cell Folate**:
  - <150 µg/L indicates deficiency (more reliable than serum folate)
- **B12 Serum Level**:
  - Important to assess for simultaneous deficiencies

### **Management (Prescribing)**
- Dietary-related deficiency: 5 mg folic acid daily for 4 months. Longer therapy if underlying cause is untreatable.
- If B12 deficiency: Supplement with both B12 and folic acid (to avoid worsening neurological symptoms).
- Pregnant/women planning pregnancy: 400 µg folic acid daily until 12 weeks; higher risk groups should take 5 mg.

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- Rich Folate Sources: Green vegetables (Brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, peas), yeast, brown rice, nuts, chickpeas.
- Encourage limiting excessive alcohol intake if relevant.
