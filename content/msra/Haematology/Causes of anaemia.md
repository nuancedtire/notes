Anaemia is a deficiency of red blood cells or haemoglobin, leading to reduced oxygen supply to tissues. Criteria: Hb < 12g/dL in females and < 13.5g/dL in males. Iron deficiency is the most common cause.

### Classification of Anaemia
1. **Microcytic**
   - **Iron deficiency anaemia**
     - Causes: Blood loss, inadequate intake, poor absorption.
   - **Thalassemias**: Alpha-thalassemia, Beta-thalassemia (trait may be asymptomatic).
   - **Sideroblastic anaemia**: Iron accumulation in mitochondria, causes include inherited, acquired, or idiopathic.
   - **Anaemia of chronic disease**: Due to autoimmune disease or cancer.

2. **Macrocytic**
   - **Megaloblastic anaemia**: Impaired DNA synthesis.
     - Causes: Vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies.
   - **Non-megaloblastic anaemia**: Rare, no DNA synthesis impairment. Causes include chronic alcoholism, liver disease, hypothyroidism.

3. **Normocytic**
   - Increased RBC loss/breakdown due to:
     - **Haemolysis**: Acquired (infections, autoimmune), hereditary (G6PD deficiency, sickle cell).
     - **Haemorrhage**.
   - Decreased production: Chronic renal failure, bone marrow suppression.
   - Increased plasma volume: Pregnancy.

### Diagnosis
**Symptoms of Anaemia**:
- Shortness of breath, fatigue, pallor, palpitations.

**Vitamin B12 Deficiency Symptoms**:
- Paraesthesia, ataxia, pale skin, glossitis, cognitive impairment.

**Folate Deficiency Symptoms**: 
- Headache, weight loss.

**Haemolytic Anaemia Symptoms**:
- Jaundice, splenomegaly, dark urine (intravascular).

### Investigations
- **MCV**:
  - Microcytic: MCV < 80fL
  - Macrocytic: MCV 80-100fL
  - Normocytic: MCV > 100fL

**For Microcytic Anaemia**:
- Iron studies vary by type (iron deficiency, thalassemia, sideroblastic, chronic disease).

**For Normocytic Anaemia**:
- Reticulocyte count, creatinine levels.

**For Megaloblastic Anaemia**:
- Blood smear, vitamin levels, homocysteine/methylmalonic acid tests, anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.

### Management
**Iron Deficiency Anaemia**:
- Oral iron replacement, IV iron if intolerant, blood transfusion if necessary.

**Vitamin B12 Deficiency**:
- Oral supplements for mild deficiency; parenteral for severe. Referral to specialists as needed.

**Folate Deficiency**:
- Supplementation for pregnant women or those at risk.

**Normocytic Anaemia**:
- Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for chronic renal disease.

**Sickle Cell Disease**:
- Hydroxycarbamide.

**Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria**:
- Eculizumab, blood transfusions.

### Non-Prescribing Management
- Treat underlying cause for various anaemias.
- Sideroblastic anaemia may require vitamin B6 or chelation for excess iron.
- Non-megaloblastic macrocytic anaemia treatment focuses on stopping bleeding.
