Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the beta chain of hemoglobin (Hb). The defect leads to abnormal hemoglobin (HbS), resulting in crescent-shaped red blood cells that can obstruct blood vessels and have a shorter lifespan. If afflicted, individuals inherit one abnormal gene from each parent. The most prevalent form is sickle cell anemia (HbSS), along with HbSC and HbS beta-thalassemia. This disease primarily affects Afro-Caribbean populations.

### Diagnosis

- **Sickle Cell Trait:** Generally asymptomatic unless triggered by dehydration, cold temperatures, or high altitude.

#### Early Symptoms (around 6 months):

- Jaundice
- Icterus
- Fatigue
- Dactylitis

Most symptoms arise from complications related to the disease.

### Investigations

Regular monitoring is essential to prevent complications. This may include:

- FBC and reticulocyte count
- Iron studies
- Pulse oximetry

**Sickle cell anemia diagnostic features:** Peripheral blood smear shows sickle-shaped cells, nucleated red blood cells, and Howell-Jolly bodies.

#### Screening:

- Pregnant women are offered screening to assess the babyâ€™s risk.
- New-borns can be screened via heel prick test.
- Genetic testing is available for families with sickle cell trait.
- Testing methods include DNA assays, Hb IEF, cellulose acetate electrophoresis, HPLC, and hemoglobin solubility testing.

### Emergency Management

#### Acute Chest Syndrome:

- Caused by blocked blood flow to the lungs.
- Symptoms: Breathing difficulty, [[chest pain]], fever, oxygen desaturation.
- **Treatment:**
  - Antibiotics
  - Oxygen
  - Fluids
  - Blood transfusion (possible chelation therapy)
  - Hydroxycarbamide for prevention.

#### Acute Pain Crisis (Vaso-Occlusive Crisis):

- Triggered by dehydration, illness, stress, temperature changes, etc.
- Symptoms: Sharp, stabbing pain anywhere, commonly in the abdomen, legs, arms, chest, and lower back.
- **Treatment:**
  - Analgesia
  - Oxygen
  - Treat precipitating causes
  - Fluids, heat pads, antibiotics (if infection), and antihistamines (if pruritis).
  - Blood transfusion may be necessary for severe cases.

#### Other Complications:

- **Infarctions:** Present as bone pain; plain X-ray for long bones.
- **Infections:** Common; may require long-term antibiotics.
- **[[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|Gallstones]]/Liver Complications:** Jaundice, hepatomegaly, iron overload, [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|gallstones]] from chronic hemolysis (surgery may be needed).

### Management

#### Prescribing:

- Daily hydroxycarbamide for frequent painful crises; monitor blood tests.
- Analgesia for pain.
- Long-term antibiotics may be necessary.

#### Non-Prescribing:

- Avoid triggers: dehydration, cold, sudden temperature changes.
- Use heat pads for relief during crises.
- Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation is the only cure but reserved for severe cases.
