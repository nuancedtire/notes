### Haemophilia B Overview

- **Definition:** Congenital X-linked disorder due to factor IX deficiency, causing bleeding tendencies.
- **Prevalence:** Affects 1:30,000 births; primarily males.
- **Comparison to Haemophilia A:** Less common and usually less severe.

### Diagnosis

- **Symptoms:**
  - Easy bruising in early childhood.
  - Spontaneous joint/muscle bleeding.
  - Excessive/Delayed bleeding post-trauma/surgery.

- **Severity Classification:**
  - **Severe:** < 1 IU/dl (< 1% of normal)
  - **Moderate:** 1-5 IU/dl (1-5% of normal)
  - **Mild:** 6-30 IU/dl (6-30% of normal)

- **Differential Diagnosis:**
  - Haemophilia A & C
  - Von Willebrand's disease
  - Vitamin K deficiency
  - Anticoagulant antagonism
  - Fibrinogen/fibrinolytic disorders
  - Platelet & blood vessel disorders

### Investigations

- **Tests:**
  - **Full Blood Count (FBC):** Normal except during bleeding.
  - **APTT:** Usually prolonged.
  - **PT, BT, Fibrinogen, vWF:** Normal.
  - **Factor IX Assay:** Reduced.
  - **Factor Inhibitors Levels:** Check periodically.
  - **Imaging (X-ray, MRI, US Doppler):** Assess degenerative joint disease.
  - **Cord Blood (Newborns):** Confirm diagnosis from carrier mothers post-delivery.

### Emergency Management

- **Immediate Actions for Acute Major Bleeding:**
  - CT scan may help detect hemorrhages.
  - Administer recombinant factor IX to achieve 100% activity.
  - Alternatives: Monoclonal-antibody purified factor IX, fresh frozen plasma, or cryoprecipitate.
  - Maintain factor IX levels for 7-10 days post-bleeding.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Prophylactic Infusions:** Necessary for severe haemophilia B in children; individualized frequency and dosage.
- **Minor Bleeds:** Pressure/elevation may suffice; otherwise use recombinant factor IX.
- **Severe Bleeds:** Refer to emergency management section.
- **Avoid:** NSAIDs and intramuscular injections (increase hemorrhage risk).
- **Surgical Procedures:** Raise factor IX activity to 50-100% pre-surgery.
- **Genetic Screening:** Recommended for carrier mothers and patient families.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Education:** Instruct patients about their condition.
- **Activity Guidance:** Avoid contact sports/risky activities but encourage physical activity.
