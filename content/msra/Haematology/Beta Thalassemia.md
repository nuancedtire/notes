- **Definition**: Beta-thalassemia is an autosomal blood disorder caused by mutations in the beta-globin (HBB) gene, leading to beta-globin deficiency and microcytic anemia.

- **Causes**: 
  - Reduced hemoglobin production.
  - Results in:
    - Hemolysis → Jaundice, secondary hemochromatosis, hypoxia, hepatosplenomegaly, frontal/parietal bossing.

- **Epidemiology**: Common in:
  - Mediterranean
  - Southeast Asia
  - Northern Africa
  - Middle East
  - India

- **Types of Beta-thalassemia**:
  - **Thalassemia Major** (Cooley’s anemia): Most severe, requires blood transfusions, exhibits symptoms like hepatosplenomegaly and severe anemia.
  - **Thalassemia Intermedia**: Moderate severity, may not require transfusions.
  - **Thalassemia Minor**: Asymptomatic carriers with one HBB mutation, occasional anemia.

### Diagnosis

- **Screening**:
  - Offered to all pregnant women.
  - Newborns screened via heel prick test.

- **Symptoms**:
  - **Thalassemia Major**:
    - Onset usually before age 2 (3-6 months).
    - Symptoms of anemia: fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, pale skin, palpitations.
    - Swollen abdomen (hepatosplenomegaly), jaundice.
    - Delayed growth, inability to gain weight.
    - Hemochromatosis symptoms: pericarditis, arrhythmias, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism.
    - "Chipmunk facies."
  
  - **Thalassemia Intermedia**: Appears later with milder symptoms.
  
  - **Thalassemia Minor**: Mostly asymptomatic.

### Investigations

- **Blood Tests**:
  - FBC: Microcytic anemia (decreased Hb, decreased MCV).
  - Peripheral smear: Microcytic, hypochromic red cells, target cells.
  - Hemoglobin electrophoresis: 
    - Major: little/no HbA, raised HbF and HbA1.
    - Intermedia: reduced HbA, raised HbF, raised HbA2.
    - Minor: mainly HbA, raised HbF, raised HbA2.
  
- **Liver Function Tests**: Elevated total LFTs, LDH, unconjugated bilirubin in major and intermedia.

- **Genetic Testing**: Used for confirmation of diagnosis.

- **Imaging**:
  - X-rays may show facial deformities in major and intermedia.
  - Ultrasound for liver/spleen enlargement.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Supplements**: Folic acid for normal red blood cell development.
- **Chelation Therapy**: Necessary to manage iron overload from transfusions; includes:
  - Deferasirox
  - Desferrioxamine
  - Deferiprone
- Thalassemia minor usually requires no treatment.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Cure**: Stem cell transplant if suitable donor is found via HLA typing.
- **Regular Treatments**:
  - Blood transfusions for major and sometimes intermedia (1 unit/month).
  - Iron chelation therapy to maintain hemoglobin levels.
  - Splenectomy for splenomegaly.
- **Lifestyle**: Healthy diet, limited alcohol, no smoking, regular exercise.
