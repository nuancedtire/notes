Sickle cell anaemia (HbS) is due to a single base mutation resulting in the substitution of glutamine for valine at position 6 in the beta-globin chain, producing HbS instead of HbA.

### Inheritance Patterns
- **Autosomal recessive**:
  - Offspring can be:
    - Unaffected (AA)
    - Heterozygous (AS - trait): Intermediate symptoms
    - Homozygous (SS): Most severe symptoms (sickle cell anaemia)
- **Heterozygous trait** common in Africa due to malaria protection.
- Approximately **10%** of Afro-Caribbean population in the UK are carriers.

### Clinical Manifestation
- Symptoms typically present at **6 months** when foetal haemoglobin synthesis ceases.
- HbSS red blood cells can sickle due to:
  - Polymerisation of HbS
  - Precipitating factors: Hypoxia, cold, dehydration, acidosis
- Results in reduced cell lifespan, impaired microcirculation, and ischaemia.

### Diagnosis
- Frequent hospital admissions often required for:
  - Severe bone pain
  - Pulmonary hypertension (30-40% of patients)
  - Chronic anaemia (Hb levels around **60-80**)
  - Vaso-occlusive crises causing avascular necrosis
  - Increased infection risk
  - Leg ulcers
  - Cardiac issues (e.g., cardiomegaly, arrhythmias)
  - Neurological abnormalities (25% experience coma/TIA/stroke)
  - Pigmented [[msra/Gastroenterology and Nutrition/Gallstones|gallstones]]
  - Chronic hepatomegaly
  - Tubulointerstitial nephritis
  - Retinopathies
  - Atrophic spleen due to infarctions
  - Osteomyelitis from salmonella

### Investigations
- **Heel-prick test** at **5-9 days** of life for screening.
- If positive, use **haemoglobin electrophoresis** to differentiate sickle cell types.
- In older children/adults, diagnosis made through:
  - Family history
  - Anaemic signs/symptoms
  - Sickled red blood cells on blood film.

### Management of Emergencies
Types of **acute crises**:
1. **Thrombotic (Vaso-occlusive)**: Painful, often due to dehydration, infection, hypoxia; can cause ischaemia in vital organs.
2. **Aplastic**: Sudden drop in haemoglobin often due to parvovirus; leads to marrow aplasia.
3. **Haemolytic**: Rare, due to increased haemolysis.
4. **Acute chest syndrome**: Common cause of post-childhood mortality; symptoms include cough and low oxygen saturation.
5. **Sequestration**: Sickle cells pool in organs, causing hypovolemia.

**Treatment during acute crisis**:
- Analgesia
- Oxygen therapy
- Blood transfusion
- Rehydration
- Antibiotics if infection present

### Long-term Management (non-prescribing)
- **Hydroxyurea**: Increases foetal haemoglobin levels and helps prevent painful episodes.
- **Vaccination**: Every 5 years, pneumococcal vaccine recommended; also flu and childhood vaccines.
