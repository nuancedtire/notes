## Iron Deficiency Anaemia (IDA)

### Definition
- Most common type of anaemia due to low iron levels.
  
### Causes
- **Reduced iron intake**
- **Increased requirements** (e.g., menstruation, childbirth)
- **Iron loss**

### Prevalence
- Affects 1 in 5 women, especially those of childbearing age, children, and individuals in middle/low-income countries.

### Diagnosis
- Combination of clinical examination and laboratory tests.
- **Classical signs/symptoms:**
  - Fatigue
  - Headaches
  - Exercise intolerance
  - Weakness
  - Pica
  - Restless Leg Syndrome
  - Exertional Dyspnoea
  - Koilonychia
  - Cheilosis/Angular Cheilitis
  - Atrophic Glossitis

### Investigations
- **Key Tests:**
  - Full blood count
  - Iron studies
- **Typical Findings:**
  - Decreased Hb and haematocrit
  - Decreased MCV
  - Microcytic, hypochromic cells on peripheral smear
  - Decreased reticulocyte count
  - Decreased serum iron
  - Increased Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)
  - Decreased transferrin saturation
  - Decreased serum ferritin
- **Additional Tests:**
  - Coeliac Screen
  - Urinalysis
  - Upper GI Endoscopy
  - Lower GI Endoscopy

### Management (Prescribing)
- Based on lab results and severity of symptoms.
- **Mild cases:** 
  - Dietary review
  - Oral iron supplements
- **Plant-based diet:** 
  - Ascorbic acid for non-haem iron absorption.
- **Intolerant to oral iron:** 
  - IV iron (consult seniors).
- **Severe cases:** 
  - Blood transfusion (with specialist input and safety protocols).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Supplementation and dietary advice for symptom relief.
- Patient education on iron-rich foods.
- Manage menorrhagia if present.
