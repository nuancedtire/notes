## Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)

### Overview
- **Definition**: Autoimmune condition resulting in isolated thrombocytopenia (<100x10⁹/litre).
- **Subtypes**:
  - **Primary ITP**: No clear cause.
  - **Secondary ITP**: Associated with identifiable conditions or medications.

### Affected Population
- Boys and girls <10 years old
- Men and women >65 years old
- Women of childbearing age

### Clinical Presentation
- Asymptomatic to life-threatening hemorrhage.
- Common symptoms:
  - Petechiae
  - Bruising
  - Unexplained or easy bleeding
  - Possible fatigue

### Risk Factors
- **Secondary ITP Associations**:
  - Lymphoproliferative disorders
  - HIV
  - Hepatitis C
  - Autoimmune disorders (e.g. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus)
- **Additional Risk Factors**:
  - Age <10 years
  - Female of childbearing age
  - Age >65 years
  - Recent viral illnesses

### Diagnosis
- **Method**: Diagnosis of exclusion via history and examination.
- **Laboratory Tests**:
  - Full blood count (FBC) for isolated thrombocytopenia.
  - Peripheral blood smear to differentiate thrombocytopenia from pseudothrombocytopenia (EDTA effect).

### Investigations
- Ruling out secondary ITP causes (e.g. HIV, Hepatitis C).
- Possible bone marrow biopsy and thyroid function tests (TFTs).

### Management

#### Prescribing
- **Asymptomatic/minor bleeding**: Conservative management.
- **Severe bleeding or platelet count <30x10⁹/litre**: Consider corticosteroids ± IVIG.
- **Platelet count >30x10⁹/litre without severe bleeding**: Conservative management.

#### Non-Prescribing
- Manage according to severity and lab results.
- Expect spontaneous remission in ~80% of children.
- Higher mortality in older and unresponsive patients.
- Observation recommended for minor bleeding/asymptomatic cases.
- Specialist consultation for chronic cases.
