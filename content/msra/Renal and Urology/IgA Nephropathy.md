## IgA Nephropathy Overview

### Definition
- Chronic autoimmune kidney disorder.
- Immunoglobulin A (IgA) accumulates in glomeruli.
- Most common nephritis type; part of "Glomerulonephritis".
- ~25% progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

### Diagnosis
- Commonly affects men in their 30s; can occur at any age/gender.
  
#### Symptoms
- Blood in urine (haematuria)
- Frothy urine (proteinuria)
- High blood pressure ([[msra/Cardiovascular/Hypertension|Hypertension]])
- Swelling in hands and feet

- Early stages may be asymptomatic, often detected years later.
- Invisible haematuria detected via tests; visible post URTI or gastrointestinal infection (24-48 hrs after).
- Elevated serum creatinine indicates [[msra/Renal and Urology/Chronic Kidney Disease|Chronic Kidney Disease]] (CKD).
- Definitive diagnosis requires a kidney biopsy.

### Investigations
- Urinalysis for haematuria/proteinuria
- Elevated serum creatinine
- High blood pressure
- Elevated cholesterol levels
- Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age
- Kidney biopsy

### Management (Prescribing)
- Focus on slowing disease progression and preventing complications.
- Control [[msra/Cardiovascular/Hypertension|Hypertension]] (<130/80 mmHg) to reduce renal damage and proteinuria.
  
#### Medications
- **ACE Inhibitors** (e.g., Captopril)
- **Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)** (e.g., Losartan) â€“ do not combine.
- **Statins** (e.g., Simvastatin) for high cholesterol.
- Immunosuppressants (e.g., Prednisolone) in rare cases. 
- Medication choices guided by local guidelines.
- Not safe during pregnancy.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Regular exercise, weight control, healthy diet, lower salt intake to manage BP and cholesterol.
- In ESRD, consider dialysis or kidney transplant; recurrence of IgA nephropathy possible post-transplant.
