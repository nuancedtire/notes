In normal physiology, ADH (vasopressin) is produced by the hypothalamus and secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. It acts on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts of the kidneys to increase water absorption, thus concentrating urine. Increased ADH secretion occurs in hypovolaemia or high plasma osmolarity to maintain water homeostasis.

### Cranial Diabetes Insipidus

Cranial diabetes insipidus is a metabolic disorder characterized by insufficient ADH production by the hypothalamus, leading to the kidneys' inability to retain water and regulate plasma osmolality.

#### Diagnosis

**Symptoms:**
- Polyuria 
- Polydipsia 
- Nocturia 
- Severity ranges from 3 to over 20 liters of urine per day
- Other symptoms: fatigue, headache, dry skin

**Types:**
- Idiopathic
- Acquired (due to damage from systemic conditions, pituitary tumors, trauma, surgery, infection)
- Congenital

**Common Causes of Acquired Type:**
- Trans-sphenoidal pituitary surgery 
- Head trauma (often transient)
 
#### Investigations

1. **Laboratory Tests:**
   - 24-hour urine collection: >3 liters suspicious
   - Serum sodium concentration: may be elevated
   - Serum plasma osmolality: may be elevated
   - Urine osmolality: usually low
  
2. **Water Deprivation Test:**
   - Confirms diagnosis by measuring serum and urine osmolality after an 8-hour fluid deprivation. In DI, urine remains dilute despite dehydration.

3. **Differentiating Cranial vs. Nephrogenic DI:**
   - Injection of desmopressin:
     - Cranial DI: Decreased urine output and increased urine osmolality 
     - Nephrogenic DI: No change in urine osmolality

4. **Additional Imaging:**
   - Cranial MRI to assess posterior pituitary gland and find underlying causes (e.g., surgery effects, pituitary mass).

### Management

#### Prescribing
- **Desmopressin:** Synthetic ADH analogue, administered intranasally, orally, or intramuscularly.

#### Non-Prescribing
- Manage dehydration with oral/IV fluids, especially hypotonic fluids for hypernatremia.
- Monitor for water overload and hyponatremia.
- Investigate and treat underlying causes (e.g., pituitary tumor may require surgical excision).
