## Hydatid of Morgagni

- **Definition**: Remnant of the Mullerian duct on the superior pole of the testicle; often pedunculated, increasing risk of torsion.
- **Epidemiology**: Torsion commonly affects boys aged 7-12; responsible for over 50% of pediatric scrotal pain.

### Diagnosis

- **Clinical Presentation**:
  - Intense scrotal pain, usually localized to the superior aspect of the testis.
  - Gradual onset of pain, unlike [[Testicular Torsion]].
  
- **Examination Findings**:
  - Swollen and tender scrotum.
  - Hard, tender nodule at upper pole of the testis (can become ischemic and blue; "blue dot sign" present in ~20% of cases).
  - Not typically high riding; absence of cremasteric reflex unlike [[Testicular Torsion]].
  - Onset of pain during sleep suggests [[Testicular Torsion]].

### Investigations

- **First-line Investigation**: Color Doppler ultrasonography.
  - Cannot usually identify hydatid of Morgagni, but can rule out [[Testicular Torsion]] if normal blood flow is observed.

### Management

- **Conservative Management** (generally resolves spontaneously within a week):
  - Rest
  - Ice
  - Scrotal elevation
  - NSAIDs
  - Analgesia

- **Surgical Intervention**: Indicated if it is hard to differentiate from [[Testicular Torsion]] or if pain is severe or prolonged.
