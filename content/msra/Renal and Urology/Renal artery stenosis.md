- **Renal Artery Stenosis (RAS)**:
  - Definition: Narrowing of renal artery lumen restricting blood flow.
  - Significant RAS: >50% reduction in vessel diameter.
  - Severe Stenosis: >70% reduction in vessel diameter.

- **Causes**:
  - Most Common: Atherosclerotic disease (90% of cases).
    - Risk Factors:
      - Smoking
      - Diabetes mellitus
      - Dyslipidaemia
  - Nonatherosclerotic: Fibromuscular dysplasia (common in healthier patients <30).
  - Less Common Causes: Neurofibromatosis, trauma, renal artery aneurysm, thromboembolism.

- **Pathophysiology**:
  - Leads to renal ischaemia.
  - Renin release from juxtaglomerular cells increases angiotensin II (vasoconstriction) and aldosterone (sodium/water retention), raising blood pressure.

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Most patients are asymptomatic; diagnosis usually incidental.
  - Common presenting complaint: Raised blood pressure (accelerated/resistant [[msra/Cardiovascular/Hypertension|Hypertension]]).
  - Abdominal bruit: Raises suspicion for RAS.
  - Symptoms of Sodium Retention: Peripheral oedema or recurrent flash pulmonary oedema.

- **Investigations**:
  - Baseline assessment with urea and electrolytes (creatinine, potassium).
  - Exclude other secondary [[msra/Cardiovascular/Hypertension|Hypertension]] causes (e.g., aldosterone-to-renin ratio).
  - Assess severity of stenosis:
    - Duplex ultrasound: Visualize kidney size and blood flow.
    - MR/CT angiography: Require contrast media, risk of nephrotoxicity.
    - Conventional angiography: Most sensitive, allows therapeutic intervention, invasive.

- **Management (Prescribing)**:
  - Aim: Prevent renal function decline, reverse water/salt retention.
  - Cardiovascular risk management:
    - Statin treatment for cholesterol.
    - Antiplatelet agent (e.g., aspirin) to reduce thrombus risk.
    - Antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors like captopril first-line).
      - Monitor ACE inhibitor use to prevent [[Acute kidney injury]].

- **Management (Non-Prescribing)**:
  - Lifestyle modifications:
    - Weight loss.
    - Low-salt diet.
    - [[Smoking cessation]].
  - Severe Cases: Revascularisation procedures (transluminal balloon angioplasty, percutaneous stenting, renal artery reconstruction).
