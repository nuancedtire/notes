## Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH)

### Definition
- Non-neoplastic condition characterized by stromal-glandular hyperplasia in the prostate's transition zone.
- Risk factors: older age, family history.

### Pathophysiology
- Hyperplasia occurs due to increased cellular proliferation vs. apoptosis.
- Aging increases aromatase & 5-alpha reductase activity, leading to elevated dihydrotestosterone (DHT) & estrogen, promoting prostate cell growth.

### Diagnosis
**Classical Symptoms:**
- Nocturia
- Weak stream / terminal dribbling
- Urinary frequency
- Dysuria
- Straining to urinate
- Hesitancy
- Incomplete voiding
- Acute retention +/- overflow incontinence
- Obstructive nephropathy

- Classification: mild, moderate, severe based on symptom severity. 
- Mechanism: Hyperplasia in the transition zone + prostatic urethral compression = bladder urethral obstruction.

### Investigations
1. **Physical Exam:** Abdominal & PR examination (smooth, enlarged, non-tender, firm prostate).
2. **Urinalysis:** Rule out hematuria & urinary tract infections.
3. **Serum PSA Levels:** Rule out prostate cancer.
4. **Abdominal Ultrasound:**
   - Increased prostate volume
   - Increased post-void volume
   - Hydronephrosis
   - Thickened bladder wall
5. **Uroflowmetry:** Chronic retention investigation; flow rate <10ml/sec indicates potential need for surgery.

### Management (Prescribing)
**Medical Therapy for Mild-Moderate BPH:**
- **Alpha-1 Antagonists** (e.g., doxazosin, alfuzosin, tamsulosin): 
  - Mechanism: Relax bladder neck & prostate smooth muscle.
  - Side effects: Hypotension, erectile dysfunction, headaches.

- **5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors** (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride):
  - Mechanism: Inhibit DHT production to reduce growth.
  - Slower acting but longer-lasting effects.
  - Side effects: Erectile dysfunction, gynecomastia.

- **Parasympatholytics** (e.g., oxybutynin): 
  - For patients without raised post-voidal volume who have irritative symptoms.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
**Lifestyle Modifications:**
- Fluid restriction at night
- Avoid alcohol & caffeine
- Ensure complete bladder emptying

**Surgery (for resistant cases):**
- **Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP):**
  - Choice of surgery, common side effects: nerve damage, impotence, potential recurrence.
  
- **Open Prostatectomy:**
  - Indicated for very large prostates only.
