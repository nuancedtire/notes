- **Definition**: 
  - Seminoma: A subtype of malignant germ cell tumor originating in seminiferous tubules of testes.
  - Accounts for up to 1/3 of germ cell tumors; only 1% of male malignancies.
  - Most common malignancy in males aged 15-35 with cure rates of up to 90% in early stages.

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Cryptorchidism: 10-40x increased risk.
  - [[Down Syndrome]]: 50x increased risk.
  - Personal or family history of [[Testicular Cancer]].
  - Environmental exposure to certain chemicals (organophosphates, organochlorines).
  - Testicular atrophy (due to [[msra/Infectious Disease/Mumps|Mumps]], trauma, hormones).

- **Diagnosis**:
  - Presentation: Unilateral, asymptomatic testicular mass; sometimes [[Infertility]]; pain is rare.
  - Physical Exam: Firm masses attached to testes, may have hydroceles.
  - Definitive Diagnosis: Histopathological analysis required.

- **Investigations**:
  - **Ultrasound**: First-line for testicular masses.
  - **CT Abdomen and Pelvis**: For staging; may under-stage in up to 20% of cases.
    - Staging: TNM system or numerical system (1 - confined to testicle; 2 - abdominal/pelvic metastasis; 3 - mediastinal metastasis).
  - **Chest X-ray**: If metastasis is suspected (commonly to mediastinal lymph nodes).
  - **Serum Markers**: 
    - beta-HCG, LDH may monitor tumor burden.
    - Elevated alpha-fetoprotein indicates nonseminoma germ cell tumor.

- **Management**:
  - Inguinal radical orchiectomy: Both therapeutic and diagnostic (histopathological analysis).
  - Post-surgery treatment based on stage:
    - **Stage I non-locally invasive**: Surveillance, carboplatin chemotherapy, or external beam radiation therapy.
    - **Stage I locally invasive & Stage II**: Carboplatin chemotherapy, BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin) or external beam radiation therapy.
    - **Stage III & IV**: BEP chemotherapy.
    - **Relapsing Seminoma**: Salvage chemotherapy (mesna, vinblastine, ifosfamide, cisplatin).
