Lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) include:

- **Cystitis**: Inflammation of the bladder
- **Urethritis**: Inflammation of the urethra

**Ascension Risk**: May lead to upper UTIs (pyelitis/pyelonephritis).

### Classification
- **Uncomplicated UTI**: Occurs in healthy, adult, non-pregnant women without urinary tract abnormalities, and not recurring. Rarely leads to complications.
- **Complicated UTI**: Higher risk of complications; antibiotic treatment may be necessary.

### Diagnosis
- **Prevalence**: 1-3% of general practice consultations.
- **Common Pathogen**: Escherichia coli (E.coli).
  
**Symptoms**:
- Dysuria (painful urination)
- Pollakiuria (frequent urination)
- Urine incontinence 
- Suprapubic/loin pain
- Foul-smelling/cloudy urine
- Fever

**Diagnostic Criteria**:
- Significant bacteriuria: ≥ 10^5 cfu/ml.
- Asymptomatic bacteriuria: Should not be treated except in pregnant women.
  
**Uncomplicated UTI Criteria**:
- Healthy
- Female
- Adult (>16 years)
- Not pregnant
- No urinary tract abnormalities
- No recurrent UTIs

**Complicated UTI Indicators**:
- Male
- Children (<16 years)
- Pregnant
- Comorbidities (e.g., diabetes)
- Urinary tract abnormalities
- Institutionalized patients
- Recurring UTIs: ≥ 2 episodes in 6 months or >3 in 12 months.

**Differential Diagnoses**:
- Vaginitis
- Urethral syndrome
- Pyelonephritis
- Overactive bladder (OAB)
- Other infections

### Investigations
- History and physical examination of bladder/kidneys
- Urine dipstick: Positive for nitrite and/or leukocytes
- Urine microscopy: Positive for leukocytes
- Urine culture (before antibiotics):
  - Excludes diagnosis; used in high-risk patients; performed in men.
  - Not necessary for uncomplicated UTIs.
- Elevated CRP: Often present with fever/flank pain.
- Pregnancy test for women of childbearing age.

### Management (Prescribing)
- Uncomplicated UTIs: Often self-eliminating; rarely lead to complications.
- **Antibiotics**: 
  - **First line**: Trimethoprim or Nitrofurantoin (safe in pregnancy but avoid at term). 
  - 10-20% E.coli resistance; review antibiotic choice based on microbiology.
  
### Management (Non-prescribing)
- Pain relief: Paracetamol or NSAIDs.
- Encourage fluid intake to prevent dehydration.
- Educate women on recurrent infection risk factors:
  - Change in sexual partner
  - Frequent intercourse
  - Use of spermicides
- **Cranberry products**: No evidence to support effectiveness.
