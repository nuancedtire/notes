## Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)

### Definition
- CKD is an abnormality in kidney function/structural damage for **≥ 3 months** with health implications.
- It can be progressive, but kidney function may remain stable in many cases.

### **Diagnosis**
**Risk Factors:**
- Diabetes
- [[msra/Cardiovascular/Hypertension|Hypertension]]
- Glomerular disease (e.g., glomerulonephritis)
- Nephrotoxic drugs (e.g., aminoglycosides)
- Systemic disorders (e.g., myeloma, lupus)
- Obstructive uropathy (e.g., urinary tract calculi)

**Asymptomatic Early Stages:**
- Progressive CKD may exhibit:
  - Uraemic foetor (urine breath odour)
  - Cachexia
  - Pruritis (itchy skin)
  - Restless legs
  - Periorbital/peripheral oedema
  - Nausea/vomiting

**Anaemia Symptoms:**
- [[Breathlessness]]
- Fatigue
- [[Palpitations]]

### **Investigations**
**Initial Tests:**
- Blood tests: serum creatinine, eGFR, electrolytes
  - **Serum Creatinine:** May be falsely low in low muscle mass/elderly.
  - **eGFR:** CKD diagnosed if < 60 ml/min/1.73 m² for > 3 months.
- Urinalysis: Assesses for kidney damage markers.
  - Possible findings: frothy urine (proteinuria), cola-coloured urine (haematuria).
- Urinary Albumin/Creatinine Ratio (ACR): ACR elevation indicates severity.

### **Management (Prescribing)**
- **Cardiovascular Risk:** Major mortality cause in CKD patients.
- Treat with:
  - Antihypertensives for blood pressure control.
  - Blood glucose management in diabetes.
  - Lipid-lowering agents (e.g., statins).
  - **ACE inhibitors/Angiotensin receptor blockers**: Slow CKD progression.

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**
**Complications:**
- Anaemia: Managed with recombinant human erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (e.g., darbepoetin-α).
- Renal mineral and bone disorder: Management includes:
  - Phosphate binders (e.g., calcium carbonate).
  - Vitamin D analogues (e.g., alfacalcidol).

**End-stage Kidney Disease (Stage 5):**
- Renal replacement therapy required (dialysis or transplant).
  - **Dialysis**: Removes waste; types include:
    - **Haemodialysis:** Requires hospital visits.
    - **Peritoneal Dialysis:** Home management.
  - **Renal Transplant**: Significant survival advantage but availability is limited.
