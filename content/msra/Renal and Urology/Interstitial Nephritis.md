Interstitial nephritis is an inflammatory autoimmune kidney disorder affecting the kidney interstitium. It has two primary forms:

- **Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN)**
- **Chronic Tubulointerstitial Nephritis (CTIN)**

### Causes
- **AIN (40-60% due to hypersensitivity to medications)**:
  - Drug-induced (e.g., beta-lactam antibiotics, NSAIDs, proton-pump inhibitors)
  - Infections (e.g., sepsis, pyelonephritis)
  - Viral infections (e.g., EBV, HIV)
  - Immune disorders (e.g., SLE, sarcoidosis)

- **CTIN**:
  - Long-term analgesic use (e.g., 5-ASA, lithium)
  - Genetic disorders (e.g., Alport's syndrome)
  - Metabolic disorders (e.g., hypercalcemia)

### Diagnosis
- AIN is seen in 6.5-15% of acute kidney damage cases, predominantly from drug reactions. CTIN is often linked to long-term analgesic use.

- **Features of AIN**:
  - Fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea/vomiting, fever, rash, eosinophilia, elevated IgE levels

- **Features of CTIN**:
  - Flank pain, hematuria, hypertension, anemia, proteinuria, typical age 30-70

- Diagnosis involves:
  - Urinalysis (hematuria/proteinuria)
  - Elevated serum creatinine
  - Eosinophilia/eosinophiluria
  - Kidney biopsy confirms diagnosis

### Investigations
- Imaging (HRCT or ultrasound) shows kidney size and abnormalities.
- High-resolution CT shows normal/enlarged kidneys in AIN; reduced renal volume in CTIN.

### Management
#### Prescribing
- Discontinue offending medications immediately.
- High-dose steroids (e.g., prednisolone) may aid recovery from AIN.
- For CTIN, manage hypertension with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, but do not combine these medications, and avoid during pregnancy.

#### Non-Prescribing
- Regular exercise, healthy diet, weight control, and reduced salt intake for hypertension.
- Severe cases may require dialysis or kidney transplant.
