Renal transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is a malignant tumor arising from transitional (urothelial) epithelial cells in the renal pelvis and ureter.

- **Incidence**: Accounts for 5-10% of primary renal malignant pelvic tumors; less common than renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
- **Demographics**: Peak incidence between 60-70 years, more common in males (4:1).
- **Metastasis**: Commonly spreads to lungs, liver, and bone.
- **Prognosis**: Tumor stage (TNM) is crucial; most renal pelvis TCCs are low grade with a 5-year survival rate exceeding 90%.

### Diagnosis

- **Symptoms**:
  - Painless gross hematuria (75-95% of patients)
  - Dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, flank pain
  - Clinical triad of hematuria, loin pain, loin mass (15% of patients)
  - Late-stage symptoms: hemoptysis, pathological fractures, persistent back pain, systemic symptoms (fatigue, malaise, weight loss)

- **Risk Factors**: 
  - Smoking
  - Carcinogen exposure, e.g., aniline dyes, chemicals in leather/textiles/plastics, petroleum, coal, coke, tar, asphalt.

- **TNM Staging**: 
  - **Primary Tumor (T)**:
    - TX: Occult
    - T0: No evidence
    - Ta: Papillary non-invasive
    - Tis: Carcinoma in situ
    - T1: Invades subepithelial connective tissue
    - T2: Invades muscularis
    - T3: Invades beyond muscularis
    - T4: Invades adjacent organs
  - **Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**:
    - NX: Cannot be assessed
    - N0: No metastasis
    - N1: Single lymph node ≤2 cm
    - N2: Single lymph node 2-5 cm or multiple nodes ≤5 cm
    - N3: Single lymph node >5 cm
  - **Distant Metastasis (M)**:
    - MX: Cannot be assessed
    - M0: No metastasis
    - M1: Distant metastasis

- **5-Year Survival Rates**:
  - Tis, Ta, T1: 91%
  - T2: 43%
  - T3, T4, N1, N2: 23%
  - N3, M1: 0%

### Investigations

- **Initial Referral**: Urologist
- **Primary Investigations**:
  - FBC (check for iron deficiency)
  - Renal function tests
  - Urine microscopy
  - Culture and sensitivity

- **Further Investigations**:
  - Urine cytology
  - Histology via ureteroscopy
  - CT scans to differentiate between kidney stones and tumors 
  - CT urography for filling defects/hydronephrosis
  - Ultrasound KUB if CT is contraindicated

- **Metastasis Investigations**:
  - CT abdomen and pelvis
  - Chest X-ray
  - Bone scan/skeletal survey
  - PET scan for active malignant cells

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Medications**:
  - Adjuvant to surgery or inoperable cases
  - First-line chemotherapy: Methotrexate + Vinblastine + Doxorubicin + Cisplatin or Gemcitabine
  - Immunotherapy: Pembrolizumab for chemotherapy-resistant metastatic TCC.
  - Irrigation with Bacille Calmette-Guerin or Mitomycin-C.

- **Palliative Care**: Systemic chemotherapy and potential palliative surgery for urethral obstructions.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Surgical Options**:
  - Endoscopic procedures for localized TCC
  - Radical nephroureterectomy for multifocal TCC
  - Partial nephrectomy (<7 cm) for localized cancer
  - Segmental resection of ureter for superficial distal cancers.

- **Follow-Up**: Varies by grade/stage; usually includes urine cytology, liver/renal function tests, CT abdomen/pelvis, and chest X-ray every 6 months for 3 years, then annually until 5 years.
