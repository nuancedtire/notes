### Epididymitis Overview
- **Definition**: Inflammation of the epididymis.
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Unilateral pain and swelling of the scrotum.
  - Pain may spread to the entire testicle (epididymo-orchitis).
  - Hot, erythematous scrotal skin.
  - Dysuria.

### Diagnosis
- **Symptoms**: Gradual onset of unilateral [[Scrotal pain and swelling]] over a few days.
- **Aetiology**: 
  - **Pre-pubertal boys & men >35**: Enteric organisms (e.g., *Escherichia coli*, *Enterococcus faecalis*).
  - **Sexually active males**: Sexually transmitted organisms (*[[Chlamydia]] trachomatis*, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, *Mycoplasma genitalium*).
  - **Non-infectious causes**: Medications (e.g., amiodarone), systemic conditions (e.g., Behçet’s syndrome).

### Investigations
- **Urinalysis**: 
  - Positive leukocyte esterase on dipstick suggests urinary tract infection.
  - First-void urine sample for culture and microscopy.
  - Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for STIs in susceptible patients.
- **Urethral Discharge**: Swab for gram staining, culture, and NAAT.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Antibiotic Regimen**: Based on suspected causative organism.
  - **STI-related acute epididymitis**: 
    - IM ceftriaxone (single dose) + 10-day oral doxycycline.
  - **Enteric bacteria suspected**: 
    - Oral quinolone (e.g., ofloxacin or levofloxacin).
  
### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Supportive Care**:
  - Bed rest and scrotal elevation.
  - IV fluid replacement if systemically ill.
- **Sexual Activity**: 
  - Abstain until treated and asymptomatic.
  - Encourage testing and treatment of sexual partners from the past 60 days.
- **Referral**: If sterile (e.g., due to conditions like Behçet’s syndrome), refer to a rheumatologist.
