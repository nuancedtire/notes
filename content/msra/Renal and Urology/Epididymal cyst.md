## Epididymal Cysts Overview

- **Definition**: Benign, painless, fluid-filled swellings from the head of the epididymis.
- **[[Spermatocele]]**: Cyst containing spermatozoa.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Often multiloculated and bilateral.
  - Common in men over 40 years.

### Diagnosis

- **Development**: Slow, over a long period.
- **Cause**: Partial obstruction of sperm passage in the vas deferens, leading to cystic dilation of the duct system.
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Often found incidentally.
  - Palpable non-tender, smooth, soft, fluctuant nodule in epididymis, distinct from testis.
  - Usually <1 cm in size.

### Investigations

- **Transillumination**: Cysts and spermatoceles typically transilluminate.
- **Differential Diagnosis**: 
  - [[Testicular Cancer]]
  - [[Varicocele]]
  - [[Hydrocele]]
  - Haematocele 

- **Ultrasound**: Recommended if lesion cannot be transilluminated to distinguish between [[Spermatocele]] and solid mass.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **NSAIDs**: Prescribed if the cyst causes discomfort.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Small Cysts**: Clinically insignificant and usually painless.
- **Surgical Excision**: Considered for large or uncomfortable cysts but has risks like:
  - Post-surgical scarring.
  - Potential obstruction of ducts leading to [[Infertility]].

- **Needle Aspiration**: Temporary treatment option, only removes fluid; does not address underlying issue, fluid may re-accumulate quickly.
