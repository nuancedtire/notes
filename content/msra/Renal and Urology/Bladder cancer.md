# Bladder Cancer Overview

## Types
- **Transitional cell**: Most common type of bladder cancer.
- **Squamous cell**: More common in the urethra.

## Risk Factors
- Male
- Age over 65
- Smoking
- Exposure to carcinogens (e.g., benzidine, aniline dyes)
- HPV 16 infection
- Chronic inflammation of the urinary tract
- Iatrogenic factors (e.g., pelvic irradiation, cyclophosphamide)
- _Schistosoma haematobium_ infection (increases risk for [[Squamous cell carcinoma]])

## Diagnosis
### Symptoms 
- Painless gross haematuria
- Dysuria
- Urinary frequency
- Suprapubic/perineal pain/rectal
- Palpable suprapubic mass

### Advanced Disease Signs
- Uraemic symptoms
- Symptoms of metastasis (bone pain, dyspnoea, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, enlarged lymph nodes)
- Constitutional symptoms (weight loss, fatigue, anorexia)

## Investigations
1. **Initial Tests**: 
   - Urinalysis
   - Full Blood Count (FBC)
   - Renal function tests
   - Coagulation profile
2. **Imaging**: Required for patients with symptoms of gross or micro-haematuria aged over 35.
   - CT urography
   - Cystoscopy
   - Imaging Findings: Mural thickening, hydronephrosis, pedunculated tumours, erythematous lesions.
3. **Staging Tests**:
   - Chest x-ray
   - CT abdomen and pelvis
   - ALP measurements and bone scan
   - Liver function tests

## Management
### Prescribing
- **Treatment Options**: Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical resection.
- **Palliative Care**: Surgical intervention and chemotherapy for symptomatic relief.
- **Non-invasive Tumours**: Intravesical chemotherapy (mitomycin or gemcitabine) within 24 hours post-resection to prevent re-implantation. Intravesical BCG can be used as an alternative.
- **Follow-up**: Cystoscopy every 3 months for monitoring.

### Non-Prescribing
- **Non-invasive Tumours**: Transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT).
- **Muscle-invasive Tumours**: Radical cystectomy and construction of a new bladder or urinary diversion.
  
### Prognosis
- Non-invasive bladder cancer: 5-year survival rate of 90-95%.
- Metastatic cancer: 5-year survival rate drops to 12%.
