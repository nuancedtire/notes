Diabetic nephropathy (diabetic kidney disease)
- Major complication of diabetes mellitus
- Leading cause of end-stage renal failure worldwide
- Characterized by:
  - Slowly progressive albuminuria
  - Hypertension
  - Decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
- Typically manifests:
  - Later in type I diabetes (over 30 years post-diagnosis)
  - May be present at type II diabetes diagnosis

### Diagnosis
- Often asymptomatic until advanced; recommend regular screening
- Use urine analysis for microalbuminuria
- Diabetic retinopathy may indicate early microvascular disease (presents as decreased vision, neovascularization, dot hemorrhages)
- Risk factors:
  - Poor glycemic control
  - Cigarette smoking
  - Dyslipidemia
  - Hypertension
- Increased cardiovascular disease risk; possible early death from cardiac disorders

- Advanced symptoms may include:
  - Peripheral edema
  - Hematuria
  - Exertional dyspnea
  - Fatigue

### Investigations
- **Urine Dipstick Test**: Basic renal function analysis; persistent proteinuria signals nephropathy
- **Microalbuminuria**: Often undetectable via standard urinalysis; diagnosed via 24-hour urine sample
- **Urinary Albumin:Creatinine Ratio**: Calculated for diagnosis; confirmed with two positive tests in six months
- **Serum Creatinine**: Measured for estimated GFR (eGFR); gradually falls with disease progression
- Renal biopsy if etiology is unclear; may show Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules and mesangial expansion under microscopy

### Management (Prescribing)
- Good glycemic control and cardiovascular protection are essential for slowing progression
- Target HbA1c: <53mmol/mol (7%); insulin doses may require reduction
- Aggressive antihypertensive therapy with:
  - ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (target BP: <130/80mmHg)
  - Statins for cholesterol control

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Lifestyle modifications:
  - Smoking cessation
  - Improved nutrition
  - Reduced dietary protein
  - Weight loss
- End-stage renal disease:
  - Renal replacement therapy (peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis)
  - Consider simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant
  - Account for other diabetes complications (blindness, autonomic neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease)
