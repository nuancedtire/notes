Hypertensive nephropathy describes kidney damage due to chronic hypertension, leading to nephrosclerosis, which is the hardening of the kidneys with vascular lesions, predominantly in pre-glomerular vessels. It can manifest as benign or malignant forms, potentially resulting in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Managing high blood pressure is essential to minimize renal damage and preserve function.

### Diagnosis

- **Prevalence**: 
  - CKD: ~6%
  - Hypertension: ~26% (adult UK population)
  - CKD is more common in women; hypertension is more prevalent in men.
  
- **Symptoms**:
  - Loss of appetite
  - Itching
  - Somnolence/confusion
  - Weight loss
  - Nausea/vomiting
  - Metallic taste

- **Diagnostic Criteria**:
  - Long-term chronic hypertension
  - Progressive renal damage
  - Albumin levels in urine (albuminuria) indicate glomerular damage.
  - 24-hour urine collection tests for proteinuria.
  - Differential diagnosis may include bilateral renal artery sclerosis.
  - Histopathological examination is needed for final diagnosis.

### Investigations

- Blood pressure measurement for hypertension detection
- Evaluation of:
  - Anaemia (normocytic, normochromic)
  - Elevated potassium, phosphate, creatinine
  - Decreased calcium, bicarbonate, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
- Urine sample analysis for albuminuria
- 24-hour urine collection for proteinuria
- Pregnancy test (for women of childbearing age)
- Ultrasound scan of kidneys
- Kidney biopsy
- Albumin to creatinine ratio aids in identifying kidney disease complications.

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Goals**: Achieve blood pressure < 130/80.
- **Medications**:
  - Loop diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs prescribed.
  - ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be combined.
  - In severe kidney damage, ARBs may be avoided due to hyperkalaemia risk; instead, loop diuretics like Furosemide are used.
  - Medications are contraindicated in pregnancy.
  
- Patients with benign nephrosclerosis can maintain renal function long-term with proper management. Prescribing should follow local guidelines.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Hydration**: Patients with CKD should drink ample water; limit salt intake.
- **ESRD Care**: Limit water intake, possible dialysis treatment.
- **Diet**: Low protein diet to reduce uremic symptoms; dietary plans from a dietitian are recommended.
- For acute cases of malignant nephrosclerosis, aggressive blood pressure reduction may be needed with IV medications (e.g., Furosemide, thiazide diuretics).
