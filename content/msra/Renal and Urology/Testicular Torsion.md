## Testicular Torsion Overview
- **Definition**: Urological emergency; testicle twists around spermatic cord, cutting off blood flow, leading to ischemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: 
  - Initial obstruction of venous flow.
  - Further rotation/swelling leads to arterial flow obstruction.
  - Risk of necrosis increases with more rotations and longer ischemia duration.
- **Timeframe for salvage**: Approximately 6 hours from onset of pain; immediate intervention increases salvage rates to nearly 100%.

## Epidemiology
- **Typical Affected Population**: Young males under 25 years.
- **Causes**: Occurs spontaneously, during exertion, or post-trauma.
- **In Neonates**: Extravaginal torsion can occur due to unsecured tunica vaginalis.
- **Common Type**: Intravaginal torsion more prevalent across all ages.
- **Risk Factors**: Congenital abnormalities like Bell Clapper deformity increase the risk.

## Diagnosis
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Sudden onset severe unilateral scrotal pain.
  - Nausea and vomiting.
  - Possible lower abdominal pain.
- **Examination Findings**: 
  - Swollen, erythematous, and tender scrotum.
  - Possible reactive hydrocele.
  - Affected testicle may be high riding or horizontal.
  - Absent cremasteric reflex.
  - Scrotal elevation doesn't relieve pain.

## Investigations
- **Ultrasound**: 
  - 93% sensitivity, 100% specificity.
  - Urgent referral to urology for suspected torsion regardless of ultrasound findings.

## Management
### Medical
- **Initial Treatment**: Analgesia and antiemetics for discomfort.
- **If Surgery is Delayed**: Manual detorsion may be attempted; Ultrasound Doppler can assess blood flow restoration.

### Surgical
- **First-line Management**: Surgical exploration and detorsion.
  - **Procedure Steps**:
    - Midline or transverse scrotal incision.
    - Incision in the tunica vaginalis to access the testicle.
    - Assess viability: salvageable testicles are often fixed to the scrotal wall.
    - Necrotic testicle requires removal.
