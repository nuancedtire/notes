## Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)

### Overview
- **Definition**: Disease characterized by multiple cysts in the kidneys.
- **Inheritance Patterns**:
  - **Recessive**: Short life expectancy; often fatal before childhood.
  - **Dominant** (Adult Polycystic Kidney Disease): Longer life expectancy; onset in adulthood; more prevalent in the population.

### Mutations
- Associated chromosomes: **4 and 16**.
- **Cyst Locations**: Primarily in kidneys, but also in liver, pancreas, spleen.
- **Characteristics**: Progressive dilation and cystic changes in tubular systems in kidneys, GI tract, liver, heart, CNS.

### Diagnosis
- **Common symptoms**:
  - Hypertension
  - Flank pain
  - Renal failure
  - Repeated UTIs
  - Renal calculi
- **Extra-renal manifestations**:
  - Hepatic cysts (most common)
  - Cerebral berry aneurysms
  - Morning headaches (due to hypertension)
  - Signs of mitral valve prolapse
  - Left ventricular hypertrophy
  - Diverticular disease
  - Abdominal hernias

### Investigations
- **Family History**: Most patients have positive family history.
- **Physical Exam**: Non-tender, palpable kidneys.
- **Ultrasound Findings**: Bilaterally enlarged kidneys with numerous cysts; potential cysts in spleen, liver, pancreas.
- **Pediatric Considerations**: Minor cystic changes may be observed.
- **Monitoring**: Essential for blood pressure and kidney function; IV pyelogram may be used for obstructions.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Medications**:
  - **ACE inhibitors** or **Angiotensin Receptor Blockers**: Treat hypertension, slow progression to end-stage renal disease.
  - **Tolvaptan**: Slows progression of renal cysts.
- **UTI Management**: Prompt treatment reduces risk of renal infection.
- **Avoid**: Chemicals harmful to kidneys (e.g., sulphonamides, NSAIDs, ADH).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Hydration**: Encourage fluid intake to prevent kidney stones and slow cyst formation.
- **End-Stage Management**: 
  - Options: Hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.
  - Definitive treatment: Kidney transplantation.
- **Monitoring**: Regular imaging and lab tests for renal/liver function; genetic counseling recommended.
- **Dialysis Statistics**: 50% of cases by age 60 will require dialysis.
