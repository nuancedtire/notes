## Pyelonephritis Overview

- **Definition**: Inflammation of the kidneys, commonly caused by bacterial infection.
- **Pathways of Infection**:
  - Bloodstream
  - Ascending from the lower urinary tract
  - Rarely from the lymphatic system

### Common Organisms
- **Most Common**: _E. coli_
- **Other Organisms**: 
  - _Enterococcus faecalis_
  - _Staphylococcus aureus_
  - _Pseudomonas_
- **In Immunocompromised Patients**: Fungi and mycobacterium.

### Patient Demographics
- Most affected: Ages 15-29 but can impact all age groups.
- **Complicated vs. Uncomplicated**:
  - **Uncomplicated**: Non-immunocompromised, normal urinary tract (not applicable to males).
  - **Complicated**: Any male patient with pyelonephritis.

### Risk Factors
- Reduced antegrade urine flow (e.g., spinal cord injury, urinary obstruction)
- Promotion of retrograde ascent (e.g., short female urethra, indwelling catheter)
- Immunocompromised states (e.g., steroid use, HIV, diabetes)
- Factors promoting bacterial colonization (e.g., [[msra/Reproductive/Menopause|Menopause]], [[Renal Calculi]]).

## Diagnosis

### Clinical Presentation
- **Triad of Symptoms**:
  - Loin pain
  - Nausea and vomiting
  - Fever
- [[Lower Urinary Tract Infection]] symptoms and haematuria may be present.

### Differential Diagnosis
- Ruptured AAA
- [[msra/Reproductive/Ectopic Pregnancy|Ectopic Pregnancy]]
- PID
- Acute [[cholecystitis]]
- [[Renal Calculi]]

## Investigations
- **Pre-Antibiotic**: Urine culture, urinalysis (nitrites, leucocytes), pregnancy test (in women).
- **Hospital Admission**: Indicated in seriously ill patients (e.g., [[Sepsis]]), dehydration, pregnancy, and complications.
- **Baseline Blood Tests**: Assess renal function and inflammation.
- **Imaging**:
  - *Renal Ultrasound*: To check for obstruction.
  - *Non-Contrast CT KUB*: If obstruction is suspected.

## Management

### Prescribing
- **Initial Assessment**: A-E assessment, resuscitation, [[Sepsis]] six guidelines as needed.
- **Antibiotics**: Based on local guidelines, common choices include:
  - Cephalexin
  - Trimethoprim
  - Ciprofloxacin
- **Supportive Care**: IV fluids, analgesia, anti-emetics.

### Non-Prescribing 
- **Chronic Pyelonephritis**: Can cause fibrosis and kidney damage, more common in children and those with urinary reflux.
- **Emphysematous Pyelonephritis**:
  - Associated with diabetes.
  - Difficult to treat with IV antibiotics.
  - May require nephrostomy or drainage, nephrectomy in severe cases.
