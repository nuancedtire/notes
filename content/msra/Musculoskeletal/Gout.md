Gout Overview:
- Characterized by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition.
- Hyperuricaemia necessary but not sufficient for gout development.
- Clinical manifestations: gout flares, chronic arthritis with tophi, uric acid nephrolithiasis.
- Commonly seen in hypertensive, obese males aged 30-60 who drink alcohol. Other risk groups: elderly, patients on diuretics or calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus).

Clinical Stages of Gout:
1. **Gout flares**: 
   - Monoarticular (polyarticular in advanced cases), common in lower limbs, often at night.
   - Triggers: alcohol, fatty foods, dehydration, certain drugs.
   - Symptoms: extreme pain, redness, warmth, swelling, and disability.
   
2. **Intercritical gout**: 
   - Asymptomatic periods between flares that shorten with disease progression.
   
3. **Chronic gouty arthritis/tophaceous gout**: 
   - Presence of tophi (non-painful, non-tender crystal accumulations).

Diagnosis:
- **During a gout flare**:
  - **Arthrocentesis** with cell counts, cultures, and polarising light microscopy for MSU crystals.
  - Clinical diagnostic criteria (points given for male sex, past flares, redness, first metatarsal involvement, hypertension/cardio disease, serum urate > 5.88 mg/dL).
  
- **During intercritical/tophaceous gout**:
  - Detect urate crystals in synovial fluid.
  - Clinical diagnosis via history and clinical examination.

Differential Diagnosis for Gout Flare:
- Septic arthritis, trauma, pseudogout, cellulitis.

Differential Diagnosis for Tophaceous Gout:
- Rheumatoid arthritis, dactylitis, osteomyelitis.

Investigations:
- **Laboratory Tests**:
  - Synovial fluid analysis for MSU crystals (polarised light microscopy).
  - Blood tests: elevated ESR, CRP, neutrophilic leucocytosis.
  - Serum urate levels vary; best checked 2+ weeks post-flare.

- **Imaging**:
  - **X-ray & MRI**: identify erosions/bone cysts compatible with tophi.
  - **Ultrasound**: “double contour sign” or hyperechoic areas suggestive of tophi.
  - **Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT)**: identifies urate deposits, distinguishes from calcium.

Management (Prescribing):
- **For gout flares**:
  - No direct benefit from urate-lowering therapy during flares.
  - Choices include:
    - **Oral glucocorticoids**: for those unable to take NSAIDs (reduce after flare).
    - **NSAIDs**: preferred for younger patients without renal/GI issues (avoid aspirin).
    - **Colchicine**: for patients with contraindications to glucocorticoids/NSAIDs (drug interactions possible).
    - **Arthrocentesis with glucocorticoid injection**: for limited inflamed joints.
    - **IL-1 inhibitors (e.g., anakinra)**: for unresponsive cases.

- **Urate-lowering chronic therapy**: maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL. Indicated for patients with disabling flares, chronic arthritis signs, tophi, or renal issues.
  - **Allopurinol**: first choice for lowering urate; screen Asian patients for HLA variant.
  - **Allopurinol + probenecid**: if urate target not reached with allopurinol alone.

Management (Non-prescribing):
- Best initiated in the intercritical period: includes education, trigger avoidance, weight management, exercise.
- Avoid protein-restricted diets; reduce alcohol intake due to its role in triggering flares.
