Dupuytren’s contracture is a hand condition involving progressive fibrosis and thickening of the palmar fascia, leading to potential finger contractures.

### Key Characteristics
- **Initial Sign:** Palmar nodules (painful/painless).
- **Fascial Cords:** Can cause finger extension prevention and irreversible stiffness.
- **Aetiology:** Unknown; genetic factors involved, associated with repetitive movements, diabetes, smoking, alcohol, and localised fibrosis disorders (e.g., Peyronie’s disease).
- **Demographics:** More common in white males over 50; fourth and fifth fingers often affected.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis:** Supported by physical examination.
  - Palpable/visible nodules
  - Palpable/visible cords 
  - Finger contractures
- **Tabletop Test:** Assesses severity; palms flat indicates mild contractures.
- **Differential Diagnosis:**
  - **Diabetic Cheiroarthropathy:** Limited mobility in most fingers except thumb; no nodules/cords.
  - **Palmar Fibromatosis:** Contracture of all fingers; potential malignancy association.
  - **Stenosing Flexor Tenosynovitis:** Dynamic contracture corrected with a trigger; unlike fixed Dupuytren’s contracture.

### Investigations
- **No imaging or investigations needed.** X-rays typically normal, no tendon calcification.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Mild:** No effect on daily activities; modify activities or use padded gloves.
- **Moderate:** Partially affecting daily activities  
  - **Radiotherapy**
  - **Glucocorticoid Injections** (triamcinolone and lidocaine) for tenderness or fast-growing nodules (helpful for nodules, not cords/contractures).
- **Severe:** Markedly affects daily activities 
  - **Open Fasciotomy**: Transection of cords.
  - **Percutaneous Needle Fasciotomy/Aponeurectomy**: Less invasive than open fasciotomy but less effective.
  - **Open Fasciectomy**: Most invasive, lowest recurrence chance; excision/removal of thickened cords.
  - **Collagenase Injection**: Effective for mild contractures (< 50°); may be used for severe cases with non-surgical preference, though full range restoration less likely.
