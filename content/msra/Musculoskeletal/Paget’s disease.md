## Paget’s Disease of Bone

### Overview
- Increased bone turnover in one or more bones.
- **Phases:**
  - **Lytic Phase:** Increased osteoclast activity leads to bone resorption.
  - **Sclerotic Phase:** New, disorganized bone is formed, causing weakness and fracture risk.
- Affected areas: lumbosacral spine, pelvis, skull, tibia, femur.

### Diagnosis
- Often asymptomatic; may be discovered through a raised alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level or x-rays.
- Family history is common.
- Symptoms if present: 
  - Bone pain (at rest or movement, worse at night).
  - Deformity.
  - Pathological fractures.
  - Hearing loss (if affecting petrous bone).
- Complications:
  - Spinal stenosis.
  - Long bone deformities.
  - Frontal bossing.
  - Loose teeth.
  - Osteoarthritis (if around a joint).
  - Rarely, heart failure due to increased vascularity.

### Investigations
- **X-rays:**
  - Radiolucency and excessive bone formation.
  - **Blade of Grass Lesion:** V-shaped sign between diseased and healthy tissue.
  - Cotton wool pattern in skull via multifocal sclerosis.
- **LFTs:**
  - Raised ALP indicates Paget’s; monitored to assess treatment response.
- **Technetium bone scan:**
  - Identifies asymptomatic disease areas post-diagnosis.
- **Serum tests:**
  - Calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D to differentiate between Paget's, osteomalacia, and fibrous dysplasia.
  - Normal levels in Paget’s; elevated in fibrous dysplasia/osteomalacia.
- **Bone biopsy:**
  - Sensitive and specific, rarely used due to fracture risk; considered if malignancy suspected.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Primary treatment:** Bisphosphonates to inhibit osteoclast activity.
- **Pain management:** NSAIDs and paracetamol.
- **Monitoring:** Serial ALP measurements.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake.
- Provide orthotics/walking aids and physiotherapy exercises.
- Surgery for deformities, fractures, or nerve compression.
- Lifelong monitoring for osteosarcoma risk at Paget’s disease sites.
