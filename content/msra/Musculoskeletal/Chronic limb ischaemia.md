Peripheral artery disease (PAD) mainly impacts the legs, leading to limb ischaemia signs. Intermittent claudication is a classic early-stage and chronic form of PAD.

## **Diagnosis**

- **Intermittent Claudication**: 
  - Muscle pain during exercise, relieved by rest.
  - Pain typically described as an ache or burning in the calves.

- **Ankle-Brachial Pressure Index (ABPI)**: Confirms PAD diagnosis. 
  - ABPI Values & Interpretation:

  | ABPI Range      | Clinical Interpretation                                     |
  |-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Greater than 1.2 | Calcified arteries (e.g., diabetes, chronic kidney disease) |
  | 0.9 - 1.2       | Normal                                                      |
  | 0.5 - 0.9       | Mild to moderate PAD                                       |
  | < 0.5           | Severe PAD                                                 |

*(Note: Other causes for intermittent claudication include vasculitides, such as Buerger's disease.)*

## **Investigations**

- **Blood Tests**: FBC, U&E, LFT, HbA1c, lipid profile.
- **Imaging**: 
  - Duplex ultrasonography (first-line for screening).
  - Angiography (essential for vascular intervention workup).

## **Management**

- **Cardiovascular Risk Optimization**: Important due to association with coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. Consider:

  - Smoking cessation
  - Weight management
  - Lipid-lowering medications
  - Antiplatelet agents
  - Antihypertensive medications
  - Glycaemic control

- **Preferred Antiplatelet**: Clopidogrel for intermittent claudication and post-revascularisation.

- **Exercise Training**: 
  - Key management strategy to reduce symptoms and enhance quality of life.
  - NICE recommends supervised sessions; unsupervised sessions only if necessary.

- **Further Intervention**: 
  - Refer symptomatic patients post-exercise training for vascular surgery (angioplasty or bypass).
  - Consider naftidrofuryl oxalate for patients wishing to avoid surgery.
