## Septic Arthritis Overview

- **Definition**: Infection causing inflammation in native or prosthetic joint(s).
- **Types**: Acute or chronic.
- **Importance**: Prompt diagnosis and treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality.

### Diagnosis

- **Common Pathogen**: Staphylococcus aureus.
- **Incidence**: 
  - Disseminated gonococcal arthritis: 2.8 cases per 100,000 person-years.
  - Prosthetic joint infection: 1.5-2.5% for primary procedures, up to 20% for revisions.
  
#### History

**Risk Factors**:
- Diabetes mellitus
- Increasing age
- Prior joint damage (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, gout)
- Previous joint surgery
- Joint prosthesis
- Skin infections with joint prosthesis
- Immunosuppression (e.g., medications, HIV)

#### Symptoms

- Swollen joint with pain on movement.
- Polyarticular in few patients.
- Fever and rigors (absence does not exclude diagnosis).
- Bacteraemia may cause:
  - Prostration
  - Vomiting
  - Hypotension
- Specific presentations:
  - Chest wall pain in sternoclavicular/acromioclavicular arthritis.
  - Buttock/hip/anterior thigh pain in sacroiliac arthritis.

#### Clinical Signs

- Joint: swollen, warm, tender, exquisitely painful on movement.
- Effusion may be noted.
- Most common joint: knee (50%), then hip, shoulder, ankle, wrists.
- Signs may be poorly localized in elderly, immunocompromised, IV drug users.
- Prosthetic joint infections may have few signs until drainage sinus forms.

**Children**: Easily missed; usually present with fever, joint pain, or unwillingness to move.

### Investigations

- **Best Inflammatory Markers**: Serum CRP, synovial fluid white blood cell count, percentage of polymorphonuclear cells, and lactate.

#### Bloods

- **FBC**: Elevated white cells; ESR and CRP for monitoring.
- **Synovial Fluid Examination**: Culture is gold standard; leukocyte count, Gram staining, polarising microscopy essential.
- **Blood Cultures**: At least two samples to rule out bacteraemia.
- **Gonococcal Testing**: Rectal, cervical, urethral, pharyngeal swabs if suspected.

#### Imaging

- **Plain X-Ray**: Limited value; may show osteomyelitis, fat pad displacement.
- **Ultrasonography**: Can show early effusion.
- **CT/MRI**: Most sensitive for periarticular abscesses, joint effusions, osteomyelitis; reserved for difficult cases.

### Management (Prescribing)

#### Antibiotics

- Start empirically; cover S. aureus and Streptococcus spp.
- IV antibiotics for 2-3 weeks, switch to oral for 2-4 weeks.

**Recommended Treatments**:
- **Flucloxacillin**: 4-6 weeks. Clindamycin for penicillin allergy.
- **MRSA suspected**: Vancomycin or teicoplanin for 4-6 weeks.
- **Gonococcal/Gram-negative**: Cefotaxime or ceftriaxone for 4-6 weeks.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

#### Joint Drainage

- Percutaneous aspiration as needed; may require surgical intervention if unresponsive.

#### Splinting

- Position of function then proceed to early mobilization to prevent contractures.

#### Infected Prosthetic Joints

- Early infection (<12 weeks): Skin pathogens.
- Late-onset infection (>1 year): Hematogenous spread.
- Management: Irrigation, debridement, exchange arthroplasty for chronic infections.
