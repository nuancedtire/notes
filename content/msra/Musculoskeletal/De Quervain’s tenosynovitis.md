De Quervainâ€™s tenosynovitis is a tendinopathy affecting the thumb tendons (abductor pollicis longus - APL & extensor pollicis brevis - EPB) on the wrist's radial side. 

- **Nature**: Not considered inflammatory; characterized by myxoid degeneration.
- **Demographics**: More common in women aged 30 to 50.
- **Etiology**: Associated with repetitive movements.
- **Pathology**: Involves narrowing at the point where tendons pass over the radial styloid process, leading to pain and tenderness exacerbated by thumb/wrist movement and object grasping.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Indicators**: 
  - Pain and tenderness on the radial wrist without recent trauma.
  - **Examination Findings**:
    - Swelling over the radial styloid process.
    - Pain during the **Finkelstein manoeuvre** (thumb is folded into fingers, and examiner rotates wrist).
  
- **Differential Diagnosis**:
  - **Osteoarthritis**: Pain distal to the radial styloid (elderly).
  - **Radial nerve entrapment**: Burning pain with paraesthesia.
  - **Intersection syndrome**: Dorsal and proximal pain.
  - **Ganglion cyst**: Dorsal and proximal, often painless.
  - **Gouty arthritis**: Acute pain and swelling with erythema.

### Investigations
- **Diagnosis**: Primarily clinical; X-rays usually normal.
- **Additional Techniques**:
  - **Ultrasound**: Tendon thickening and possible thinning of the EPB due to stenosis.
  - **Doppler ultrasound**: Shows hypervascularity.

### Management (prescribing)
- **Pharmacological**: NSAIDs for pain relief; self-resolution expected within a year.

### Management (non-prescribing)
- **Conservative Treatment**:
  - **Spica splint** (stabilizes thumb while allowing finger movement).
  - Rest and ice; splint should not be full-time.
  - Wrist and hand exercises may help.
  
- **If symptoms persist**:
  - **Glucocorticoid injections**: For severe symptoms or lack of response to NSAIDs (usually methylprednisolone with local anesthetic).
  
- **Surgery**: Consider for persistent symptoms despite conservative measures; involves releasing pressure on the tendons, generally effective.
