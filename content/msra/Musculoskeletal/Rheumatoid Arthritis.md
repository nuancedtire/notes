Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Overview
- Chronic, autoimmune, inflammatory, multisystem disease
- Affects joints with extra-articular manifestations
- Prevalence: 1% globally; female to male ratio 3:1
- Aetiology: multifactorial (genetic and environmental factors, e.g., HLA-DR4 haplotype, cigarette smoking)

## Diagnosis
- Age of onset: 30-50 years
- Key features:
  - Progressive, symmetrical polyarthritis
  - Affects small joints (hands, feet); spares distal interphalangeal joints
  - Symptoms: swollen, painful, stiff joints (worse in the morning, lasts over one hour)
  - Common manifestations: Tenosynovitis and bursitis
  - Advanced RA deformities: Boutonniere's deformity, swan neck deformity, ulnar deviation (digits), radial deviation (wrist)
  - Atlantoaxial subluxation (rare, threatens cervical spinal cord)

### Extra-articular manifestations
- Respiratory: interstitial lung disease, pleural effusions, bronchiectasis
- Cardiac: pericarditis, myocarditis, pericardial effusions
- Dermatological: rheumatoid nodules (elbow)
- Ophthalmic: scleritis, episcleritis, keratoconjunctivitis
- Haematological: anaemia, neutropenia

## Investigations
- Primarily a clinical diagnosis
- Laboratory and radiological tests assist with confirmation and prognosis
- Key tests:
  - Rheumatoid factor: Positive in ~70% (non-specific, also in SLE, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis)
  - Anti-citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP): Present in ~80% (specific to RA, predictor of poorer prognosis)

### Routine blood tests
- Full blood count
- CRP, ESR
- Liver function tests 
- Urea and electrolytes

### Imaging
- Baseline radiographs (hands and feet) for diagnosis/severity
- Ultrasound (wrist, fingers) for synovitis detection

### Diagnostic criteria
- American College of Rheumatology criteria (2010) 
  - Cut-off for RA: 6 points (includes results from CRP, rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP)

## Management (Prescribing)
- Disease activity scores: Help guide treatment (e.g., DAS28 score)
- Common medications:
  - Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs): Methotrexate (preferred), sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide
  - Corticosteroids: Oral, intramuscular, intra-articular (used with DMARDs)

### Severe cases
- Biological agents if DMARDs ineffective:
  - Anti-TNF (e.g., etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab)
  - Anti-CD20 (e.g., rituximab)
- Note: Greater immunocompromise, higher infection risk

## Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Regular physiotherapy: Maintains joint range/muscle power
- Recommended activities: Gentle exercises, particularly swimming
- Multidisciplinary team involvement:
  - Occupational therapists
  - Podiatrists
  - Psychologists
