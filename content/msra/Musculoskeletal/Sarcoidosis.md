## Sarcoidosis Overview

- **Definition**: Chronic multisystem disorder of unknown aetiology; characterized by non-caseating granulomas.
- **Commonly Affected Organs**: Lungs, skin, eyes.
- **Prevalence**: Most prevalent in Northern Europe, especially Scandinavia.
- **Demographics**: More common in females; average age of onset is the third and fourth decades of life.

## Diagnosis

- **Pulmonary Involvement**: Seen in >90% of cases; can present with:
  - Cough
  - Wheeze
  - Exertional dyspnoea
- **Constitutional Symptoms**:
  - Fever
  - Weight loss
  - Chronic fatigue

### Clinical Features

- Hepatomegaly
- Splenomegaly
- Lymphadenopathy
- Ocular involvement (e.g., anterior uveitis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca)
- Hypercalcaemia and nephrocalcinosis
- Erythema nodosum
- Neurological symptoms (e.g., seizures, cranial nerve palsies, peripheral neuropathy)
- Cardiac arrhythmias

### Classic Syndrome

- **Löfgren Syndrome**: Acute erythema nodosum, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, fever, and arthralgia—strongly suggestive of sarcoidosis.

## Investigations

- **Diagnosis of Exclusion**: Requires clinical, radiological presentation, and pathological evidence of non-caseating granulomas.

### Initial Tests

- Full blood count: May show leukopenia and anaemia.
- Serum calcium: May be elevated.
- Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE): Elevated; monitors disease activity.
- Chest X-ray: Initial imaging for staging (bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, fibrosis).

### Further Tests

- **High-Resolution Chest CT**: Reveals reticulonodular opacities, classically in upper lung lobes.
- **Bronchoscopy**: Allows visualization of mucosa, transbronchial biopsies (to check for granulomas), and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis (increased CD4:CD8 T cell ratio).

## Management

### Prescribing

- **Spontaneous Resolution**: Possible in early-stage disease.
- **Corticosteroids**: Oral prednisolone or inhaled budesonide for pulmonary symptoms.
- **Alternative Immunosuppressants**: Methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine.
- **Indications for Corticosteroids**: Dermatological, ocular, and nervous system involvement.

### Non-Prescribing

- **End-Stage Lung Disease**: Lung transplantation indicated for stage IV sarcoidosis and respiratory failure; this is the second most common indication for lung transplant in interstitial lung disease.
