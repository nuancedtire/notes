## Osteomyelitis Overview
- **Definition**: Infection of bone.
- **Types**: 
  - **Primary**: Due to direct trauma or surgery.
  - **Secondary**: Due to local infections (e.g., cellulitis).
  - Can also spread from unrelated primary infections (e.g., pneumonia, abscess).
  - Sometimes, no source is identified.
- **Common Organisms**: Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Streptococci.

## Forms of Osteomyelitis
- **Acute**: Sudden onset.
- **Chronic**: Develops from untreated acute infection, leading to:
  - Sinus tracts and dead bone infection (sequestra).
  - X-ray findings: 
    - **Cloaca**: Openings in bone for pus escape.
    - **Involucrum**: New bone formation around sequestrum.

## Diagnosis
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Diabetes, immunosuppression, vascular disease, sickle cell disease (commonly Salmonella).
  - Surgical prosthesis, IV drug use, open fractures.
  - In children: usually following skin lesion/sore throat, affecting growth plates of long bones.

- **Clinical Features of Acute Osteomyelitis**:
  - Pain and tenderness.
  - Reduced range of movement.
  - Systemic symptoms: fever, malaise, night sweats.
  - Possible erythema and effusion.

- **Cierny-Mader Classification**:
  - **Comorbidities**:
    - **A**: No comorbidities; tolerates antibiotics/surgery.
    - **B**: Comorbidities affecting healing and treatment effectiveness.
    - **C**: Severe comorbidities; treatment may be more harmful.
  - **Bone Involvement Grades**:
    - **I**: Haematogenous spread; endosteal and medullary bones.
    - **II**: Superficial disease from a local infection.
    - **III**: Involves cortical and medullary bone, limited to outer edges.
    - **IV**: Diffuse involvement; little healthy bone remains.

## Investigations
- **Observations**: RR, HR, BP, temperature, oxygen saturation.
- **Blood Tests**:
  - FBC: May show leucocytosis.
  - CRP: Elevated.
  - Blood cultures: Positive in 60% of patients.
- **Imaging**:
  - **X-ray**: Ensures no fractures/tumors; osteopenia appears ~7 days post-infection.
  - **MRI**: Best for assessing soft tissues and bone.
- **Biopsy**: Guides antibiotic selection.

## Management
### Emergency Treatment
- Prompt and aggressive treatment to prevent chronic osteomyelitis.
- **Complications**: Growth limitation in children, joint stiffness, fractures, deformities, potential amputation.

### Pharmacological Management
- **Intravenous Antibiotics**: 2-4 weeks upon suspicion.
- **Oral Antibiotics**: Up to 2 additional weeks after IV course.
- Follow local guidelines for specifics.
- Blood cultures and biopsy should precede the start of antibiotics.
- Provide analgesia for pain relief.
- Surgery may be necessary if antibiotics fail, to address sequestra or abscesses.

### Non-Pharmacological Management
- Immobilization of the affected area.
- Avoid full weight-bearing if lower limbs are affected until infection resolves.
