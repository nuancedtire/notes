## Definition
- **Mononeuritis multiplex**: Peripheral neuropathy with multiple distinct nerve dysfunctions.
- Symptoms are localized to specific areas corresponding to affected nerves, unlike **polyneuropathies**, which present with diffuse symptoms.

## Pathophysiology
- Caused by ischaemic damage due to blood vessel occlusion, mainly from inflammation (vasculitis).
- Can be **primary** (spontaneous) or **secondary** (due to infections, medications, malignancies).

## Diagnosis
- Presents with:
  - **Painful** sensory & motor deficits.
  - **Acute or subacute** onset.
- Key historical features:
  - Weakness & loss of sensation.
  - Pain correlated with neurological deficit.

### Common Causes
1. **Vasculitis**
   - Primary or secondary.
2. **Infective Conditions**:
   - HIV
   - Hepatitis B
   - Hepatitis C
3. **Metabolic Conditions**:
   - Diabetes Mellitus
4. **Neoplastic Conditions**:
   - Lymphoma
   - Carcinoma
5. **Inherited Conditions**:
   - Hereditary neuropathy with pressure palsies.

### Investigation Goals
1. Confirm mononeuritis multiplex diagnosis.
2. Identify underlying etiologies.

## Investigations
### Diagnosis Confirmation
- Use of **Electromyogram (EMG)**:
  - Compare conduction in affected vs unaffected nerves.
  - Consultation with a neuromuscular neurologist is advised before EMG.

### Cause Investigation
- **Nerve biopsy** to confirm diagnosis and identify treatable causes.

## Management (Prescribing)
- Based on underlying condition causing neuropathy.
- Usually includes corticosteroids (e.g., prednisolone Â± methylprednisolone) to reduce inflammation.
- Seek neuromuscular consultant guidance on steroid dosage.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Involvement of healthcare professionals related to the underlying cause.
- Example: Mononeuritis multiplex from Hepatitis C should involve a hepatologist, infectious disease consultant, and neuromuscular neurologist.
- Ensure follow-up for complications from underlying conditions (e.g., renal follow-up for vasculitis patients).
