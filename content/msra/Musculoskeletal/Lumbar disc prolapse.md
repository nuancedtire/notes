## Lumbar Disc Prolapse Overview

- **Definition**: Herniation of the nucleus pulposus through the annulus fibrosus.
- **Causes**: 
  - Trauma (e.g., heavy lifting in a flexed position).
  - Genetic predisposition.
  - Sudden events (e.g., coughing, sneezing).
- **Symptom**:
  - Pain radiating to the buttock or leg (sciatica).
- **Common Levels**: L4/5 and L5/S1.
- **Prolapse Direction**: Usually posterolaterally; central prolapse can compress the cauda equina (emergency).

## **Diagnosis**

### Clinical Features
- **Pain**: In lumbar region, possibly radiating; sudden or insidious onset.
- **Aggravating Factors**: Straining, coughing.
- **Relieving Factors**: Lying flat.

### Physical Examination
- **Spinal Movement**: Limited extension, forward flexion, and possibly unilateral lateral flexion.

### Sensory, Weakness, and Reflex Loss (Table)

| Disc level | Root | Sensory Loss | Weakness | Reflex Loss |
|------------|------|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **L3/4**   | L4   | Inner calf   | Inversion of foot | Knee        |
| **L4/5**   | L5   | Outer calf, dorsum of foot | Dorsiflexion of toes |             |
| **L5/S1**  | S1   | Sole, lateral foot | Plantar flexion | Ankle      |

## **Investigations**

- **MRI of the Lumbar Spine**: Best for visualizing soft tissues and intervertebral discs. Diagnosis should be clinical unless pain persists beyond expected recovery.

## **Management (Prescribing)**

- Provide adequate analgesia.
- Consider weak opioids if paracetamol and NSAIDs are insufficient.

## **Management (Non-Prescribing)**

- **Initial Rest**: Short bed rest (up to 2 days).
- **Mobilization**: Encourage normal activities, limit heavy lifting, and perform physiotherapy exercises to maintain flexibility and mobility.
- **Outcome**: 90% resolve pain with analgesia and physiotherapy.
- **Further Action**: If pain persists over 6 weeks or weakness progresses, consider discectomy.
