Reiter’s syndrome (reactive arthritis) is an inflammatory condition usually developing 1-3 weeks post bacterial infection of the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tract. Common bacteria include:

- _Chlamydia trachomatis_
- _Salmonella enteritidis_
- _Campylobacter jejuni_
- _Shigella dysenteriae_

### Epidemiology
- Affects all ages, most common in men aged 20-40 years.
- A type of spondyloarthropathy, associated with HLA-B27 genetic marker.
- Majority have a single attack, with symptoms lasting up to six months; possible future relapses.

### **Diagnosis**
Classical triad: arthritis, urethritis, conjunctivitis. Other features include:

- **Keratoderma blenorrhagicum**: hard lumps and blistering on soles
- **Circinate balanitis**: rash on the penis
- **Enthesitis**: inflammation of tendon insertion (e.g., plantar fasciitis)
- **Dactylitis**: swelling of fingers/toes ('sausage' digit)
- **Mouth ulcers**: recurrent on tongue, lips, gums
- **Nail dystrophy**: subungual hyperkeratosis
- **Constitutional symptoms**: fever, fatigue, weight loss

Urethritis often presents first with burning dysuria. Arthritis is reported in ~95% of patients, typically asymmetrical peripheral oligoarthritis with sacroiliitis, presenting as lower back pain/stiffness. Conjunctivitis may cause redness, pain, blurred vision.

### **Investigations**
Clinical diagnosis based on history and examination; supportive tests may include:

- Elevated **ESR** and **CRP** in acute phase
- Negative **ANA** and rheumatoid factors to rule out other arthritis forms
- Positive **HLA-B27** may guide prognosis and recurrence risk

### **Management (prescribing)**
Aim: symptomatic relief and prevention of joint damage.
- **NSAIDs** (e.g., indomethacin, naproxen) for inflammation/pain management.
- **Corticosteroids** (oral/intra-articular) if unresponsive to NSAIDs.
- **DMARDs** (e.g., sulfasalazine, methotrexate) for relapsing cases or to prevent joint destruction.

### **Management (non-prescribing)**
- **Physiotherapy**: Strengthening and range-of-motion exercises recommended to enhance muscle strength, flexibility, and reduce stiffness.
