## Tennis Elbow Overview

- **Also Known As:** Lateral epicondylitis
- **Description:** Chronic degenerative tendinosis affecting extensor muscle tendon attachment to the lateral epicondyle of the humerus (extensor carpi radialis brevis tendon).
- **Common Cause:** Overuse syndrome, often in 4th and 5th decades of life.
- **Common Activities:** Tennis, gripping activities (construction work, kayaking).

## Diagnosis

- **Suspicious Indicators:**
  - History of repetitive injury in vulnerable age group.
  - Elbow pain around lateral epicondyle with arm extended.
- **Examination Findings:**
  - Reduced grip strength (due to pain).
  - Point tenderness on palpation of lateral epicondyle.
  - Pain on resisted wrist and finger extension.

## Investigations

- **Typically Not Required:** Diagnosis can usually be made based on history and physical findings.
- **When to Consider Tests:** If red flags are present (joint swelling, trauma, systemic symptoms):
  - Elbow x-ray or MRI may be helpful to exclude alternative diagnoses.

## Management

### Prescribing

- **Medications:** 
  - Oral NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, diclofenac) for pain relief in the initial weeks post-injury.

### Non-Prescribing

- **Initial Management:**
  - Ice application.
  - Activity modification (avoid heavy lifting, gripping, twisting).
- **Persisting Symptoms:**
  - Corticosteroid injections for short-term relief.
  - Referral to physiotherapy for:
    - Eccentric strengthening.
    - Stretching exercises.
- **Additional Aids:**
  - Forearm straps.
  - Wrist extension splints to reduce tendon stress.
  
- **Surgical Consideration:** 
  - If symptoms persist after 6-12 months, surgical debridement of abnormal tissue may be an option.
