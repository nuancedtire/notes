### Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD) Overview
- **Commonly affects**: Legs
- **Acute Limb Ischaemia (ALI)**: Sudden loss of limb perfusion
- **Risks**: High risk of limb loss and mortality without prompt intervention

### Causes of ALI
- **Thrombosis in situ** (60%)
- **Embolisation** (30%)
- **Rarer causes**:
  - Dissection
  - Compartment syndrome
  - Vasculitis
  - Trauma

### Diagnosis
- **Definition**: Clinical symptoms develop in less than 2 weeks; typically over minutes to days.
- **Classic presentation - the 6 Ps**:
  - **Pain** at rest (worst in distal limb)
  - **Pulselessness**
  - **Pallor**
  - **Perishingly cold** (poikilothermia)
  - **Paraesthesia**
  - **Paralysis** (late sign)

Patients with thrombotic occlusions may present with subtle features of the 6 Ps.

### Investigations
- **ECG**: Detect cardiac arrhythmias
- **Blood tests**: VBG, FBC, U&Es, glucose, creatine kinase, clotting, group, and save
- **Imaging**: Arterial duplex and/or angiography

### Management
#### Prescribing
- **Analgesia**
- **Supplemental oxygen**
- **5,000 units of unfractionated heparin**

#### Non-prescribing
- **Definitive management** guided by suspected aetiology and local expertise.
- **Urgency** of intervention based on Rutherford classification:
  - **I** – viable
  - **IIa and IIb** – threatened
  - **III** – irreversible
- **Revascularisation** options:
  - Surgical or endovascular thrombolysis (not suitable for irreversible ischaemia; requires amputation or palliative care).
- **Embolectomy**: First-line option for suspected embolic aetiology.
