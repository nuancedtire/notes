## Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Overview

**Definition**: Common neuropathy caused by median nerve compression in the carpal tunnel at the wrist.

### Diagnosis

**Symptoms**:
- Intermittent pain, numbness, and paraesthesia in the hand and fingers.
- Confined to the sensory distribution of the median nerve:
  - Palmar surface of the thumb
  - Index finger
  - Middle finger
  - Radial half of the ring finger

**Typical Characteristics**:
- Symptoms worse at night or triggered by repetitive hand movements.
- Untreated cases may lead to weakness and atrophy of the thenar eminence.

**Clinical Tests** (indicate carpal tunnel syndrome if they cause or worsen paraesthesia):
- **Tinel's Sign**: Percussing over median nerve at the carpal tunnel.
- **Durkanâ€™s Test**: Sustained pressure on the carpal tunnel.
- **Phalen's Manoeuvre**: Wrist flexion for 60 seconds.

### Investigations

- **Electrophysiological Studies**: Required for formal diagnosis.
- **Specific Investigations** to identify underlying causes (e.g.):
  - Hypothyroidism
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
  - Ganglion
  - Traumatic fracture of distal radius

### Management

**Primary Care Options**:
- **Lifestyle Measures**: Avoid repetitive hand and finger movements.
- **Wrist Splinting/Bracing**: Effective symptom relief.

**Advanced Treatments**:
- **Corticosteroid Injections**: For refractory cases.
- **Surgical Decompression**: Carpal tunnel release may be necessary for severe cases.
