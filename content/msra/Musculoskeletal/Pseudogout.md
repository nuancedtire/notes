### Pseudogout Overview
- Also known as: Calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis
- Cause: Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in joints leading to inflammatory arthritis
- Commonly affected areas: Hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders, knees, ankles
- Mimics: Osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis in chronic cases

### Diagnosis
#### Risk Factors
- Family history
- Previous joint injury or surgery
- Increasing age
- Hyperparathyroidism
- Haemochromatosis
- Hypomagnesia
- Hypophosphatasia

#### Clinical Features
- Painful joints
- Joint effusion, redness, warmth
- Sudden worsening of existing osteoarthritis
- Elderly patients may experience malaise and fever

### Investigations
- **Synovial Fluid Analysis**
  - Definitive diagnosis
  - Differentiates from septic arthritis and gout
  - Crystal characteristics: Rhomboid-shaped, positively birefringent
- **X-ray**
  - May show destructive changes resembling osteoarthritis (more severe)
  - Possible calcification of cartilage
- **Blood Tests**
  - Serum calcium
  - Iron studies (haemochromatosis)
  - Serum parathyroid hormone
  - Serum alkaline phosphatase (hypophosphatasia)
  - Serum magnesium (hypomagnesia)

### Management (Prescribing)
- Pain management:
  - NSAIDs (e.g., diclofenac, naproxen) and paracetamol if no contraindications
- Intra-articular corticosteroids (e.g., hexacetonide, dexamethasone, triamcinolone) for mono- or oligo-articular disease
- If steroid injection is declined or contraindicated, use colchicine
- Severe cases unresponsive to intra-articular steroids and analgesia may require systemic corticosteroids

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- Additional pain relief strategies: Ice, joint splinting, joint aspiration
- No current medications approved for regular prevention of attacks
