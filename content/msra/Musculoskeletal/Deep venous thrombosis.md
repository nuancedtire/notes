### Deep Venous Thrombosis (DVT)

**Overview**
- DVT is a form of venous thromboembolism (VTE), primarily occurring in lower limbs (90% of cases).
- Risk of clot traveling to the lungs can lead to pulmonary embolism (PE).

#### Virchow’s Triad (Risk Factors)
1. **Hypercoagulability**
2. **Haemodynamic changes** (blood stasis or turbulent flow)
3. **Endothelial injury**

#### Specific Risk Factors for DVT
- Recent surgery (particularly orthopaedic)
- Malignancies
- Previous VTE
- Family history of VTE
- Age > 65 years
- Hormonal medications (contraceptives, hormonal replacement)
- Pregnancy
- Obesity
- Limited mobility
- Thrombophilia

### Diagnosis
- **Asymptomatic Presentation:** 65% of lower limb DVTs are asymptomatic.
- **Symptoms to Watch For:** Leg swelling, pain, warmth, mild fever, pitting edema.
- **Wells Score Calculation:**
  - **< 1:** Likely excludes DVT; perform D-dimer.
    - Negative D-dimer: DVT excluded.
    - Positive D-dimer: Perform ultrasound (US).
      - Negative US: DVT excluded.
      - Positive US: DVT confirmed.
  - **≥ 2:** Likely indicates DVT; perform D-dimer and US.
    - Both negative: DVT excluded.
    - Positive US with negative D-dimer: DVT confirmed.
    - Negative US with positive D-dimer: Repeat US in one week.

#### Differential Diagnosis
- Muscle tears
- Lymphatic obstruction
- Baker’s cyst rupture
- Cellulitis

### Investigations
- **Laboratory Tests:** Not routine but can help understand underlying causes.
- **D-dimer:**
  - Normal: < 500 ng/mL
  - Positive: > 500 ng/mL
  - High sensitivity, low specificity (elevated in infections, pregnancy, malignancy).
- **Ultrasound:** Imaging technique of choice; positive if vein cannot be compressed.

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Anticoagulation** is primary treatment; assess bleeding risk using the **HAS-BLED** score.
- **Initial Anticoagulation (first 10 days):**
  - Fondaparinux or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) like enoxaparin.
  - Unfractionated heparin for renal failure or high bleeding risk.
  - VKAs (e.g., warfarin) cannot be initial treatment.
  - Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs) - newer options with lower bleeding risk.
- **Long-term Anticoagulation (10 days to 3 months):** 
  - Options include subcutaneous or oral anticoagulation; factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors preferred.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Prevention:** Discontinue contraceptive pill 4 weeks before surgery; encourage early mobilization and use compressive stockings.
- **If Anticoagulation is Contraindicated:**
  - Inferior vena cava filter placement.
  - Active ultrasound monitoring.
