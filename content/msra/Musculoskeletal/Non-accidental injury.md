A non-accidental injury indicates suspicion of **physical abuse** in children.  

### Main Categories of Child Abuse:
- Physical abuse
- Emotional/Psychological abuse
- Sexual abuse
- Neglect

### Diagnosis of Non-accidental Injury:
Consider if:
1. History has inconsistencies or changes.
2. Injuries are inconsistent with provided history.
3. Injury is incompatible with childâ€™s developmental stage (e.g., long bone fractures in non-mobile child).
4. Evidence of poor parent-child bonding exists.
5. The child is known to social services.

### Risk Factors for Non-accidental Injury:
- Evidence of violence in the home
- Parental/carer substance abuse
- Parental/carer mental health disorders
- Poor stress management by parent/carer
- Low socioeconomic status

### Initial Assessment:
Gather information non-judgmentally. Consider rare conditions that may mimic signs of injury, such as:
- Haemophilia causing bruising
- Osteogenesis imperfecta causing fractures
- Osteoporosis (due to propionic acidaemia) causing fractures

### Investigations:
Conduct to:
1. Investigate non-non-accidental injury differentials (e.g., coagulopathies).
2. Look for evidence of other injuries via:
   - Skeletal survey
   - Ophthalmology review
   - CT head imaging

### Management (Prescribing):
Injuries must be managed appropriately based on type.

### Management (Non-prescribing):
#### Breaking Confidentiality:
Balance child welfare and maintaining confidentiality. If non-accidental injury is suspected:
- Seek evidence of other maltreatment.
- Consult with a senior colleague or named safeguarding lead.

If there's enough evidence, break confidentiality and share details with relevant authorities. Remember:
- Certainty of abuse is not required; ensure risks of not sharing outweigh sharing.

**GMC Guidance for Sharing Information:**
- Legal obligation exists.
- Consent from the individual is given.
- Benefits to public or individual outweigh withholding reasons.

### Information to Share:
1. Identities of child/young person and their parents.
2. Identity of person posing a risk.
3. Reasons for concerns.
4. Relevant case information.
5. Exclude irrelevant confidential info.

### Informing Family:
Notify family about the obligation to share information, gain consent if safe to do so, and explain:
- The shared information specifics.
- Whom it will be shared with.
- Usage of the information.
- Where they can seek independent advice.

**Exceptions for Discussing with Family:**
- Delaying would increase risk of harm.
- Seeking consent increases risk of harm.
- Disclosure is already justified in the public interest.

### Continuing Management:
Determine ongoing management based on the child's safety at home. Interventions focus on improving parenting skills. Child removal occurs only in extreme cases of clear risk.
