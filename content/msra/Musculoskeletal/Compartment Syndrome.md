Compartment syndrome is characterized by elevated tissue pressure within a closed osteofascial space. It can arise from:

- Long bone fractures
- Hemorrhage
- Direct soft-tissue injury

### Pathophysiology
- Increased pressure restricts capillary blood flow. 
- Early recognition and intervention are crucial to prevent tissue necrosis.

### Diagnosis
- Primarily clinical with a high index of suspicion.
- **Classic 6 Ps** of compartment syndrome:
  - **P**ain
  - **P**oikilothermia
  - **P**araesthesia
  - **P**aralysis
  - **P**ulselessness
  - **P**allor
  
- Most common clinical features:
  - Pain disproportionate to examination findings, worsens with passive movement.
  - Sensation of pressure in the compartment.

- Typical sites include:
  - Anterior and deep posterior compartments of the leg.
  - Volar forearm compartment.

### Investigations
- Intracompartmental pressure measurements if diagnostic uncertainty exists.
- Serum creatine kinase and urine myoglobin to assess for muscle necrosis.

### Management
- **Emergency Treatment:**
  - **Dressing Release**: Immediate release of casts/dressings.
  - **Fasciotomy**: First-line treatment for non-dressed patients.
  - **Supportive Care**: Analgesia (e.g., morphine), IV fluids.
  - **Debridement and Amputation**: When muscles are necrosed (failure to contract with electrocoagulation).

- **Post-Fasciotomy Care:**
  - Wound care and skin grafts.
  - Physical and occupational therapy.
  - Address the original cause (e.g., fracture management).
