**Definition:**
- Rhabdomyolysis is an acute, potentially life-threatening condition due to breakdown of skeletal muscle fibers, leading to leakage of muscle contents into circulation.

**Consequences:**
- Leakage can cause:
  - Electrolyte disturbances
  - Acidaemia
  - Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
  - Renal failure
  - Multi-organ failure

**Common Causes:**
- Alcohol abuse
- Muscle overexertion (e.g., marathon runners)
- Traumatic crush injuries

**Other Causes:**
- Genetic disorders (e.g., Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy)
- Seizures and status epilepticus
- Infections (e.g., influenza, HIV, _Legionella_ species)
- Medications (e.g., statins)
- Toxins (e.g., snakebites)
- Endocrine conditions (e.g., hypothyroidism)

### Diagnosis:
- High suspicion based on history and clinical presentation.
- Symptoms:
  - Muscle pain, swelling, tenderness
  - Dark-colored urine
  - Fever, malaise, nausea, confusion

### Investigations:
- **Serum Creatine Kinase**: elevated >5 times normal; may exceed 50 times in severe cases.
- **Other Tests**:
  - Urine dipstick: may show false-positive for blood due to myoglobin.
  - Serum transaminases: often elevated (especially AST).
  - Muscle biopsy: indicated if genetic aetiology is suspected.

### Emergency Management:
- **Acute Kidney Injury (AKI)**: main serious complication.
  - Managed with advanced life support (ABCDE).
  - Address complications: fluid overload, hyperkalaemia, acidosis, uraemia.
  - Dialysis may be needed for severe metabolic acidosis, persistent hyperkalaemia, or refractory pulmonary oedema.
  
- **Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)**: late development.
  - Treat the underlying condition; transfusions may be needed for depletion.

- **Severe Hyperkalaemia**: can cause cardiac issues.
  - Treated with intravenous calcium gluconate, followed by insulin and dextrose infusion.

### Management (Non-prescribing):
- **Rehydration**: Aggressive IV rehydration to aid renal clearance of toxins (e.g., Hartmann’s solution).
- **Diuretics**: such as furosemide, may enhance toxin excretion.
