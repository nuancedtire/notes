## Osgood-Schlatter's Disease Overview

- **Definition**: Inflammation of the patellar tendon at its insertion on the tibial tuberosity due to overuse, primarily in active children and adolescents.

- **Key Anatomy**: 
  - **Patellar Tendon**: Inserts into the tibial tuberosity; common tendon for the quadriceps muscle.
  - **Tibial Tuberosity**: Anterior prominence on the proximal tibia; cartilaginous in children, fully ossifies in late adolescence.

- **Etiology**: Overactivity leads to excessive traction on the immature tibial tuberosity, resulting in inflammation and pain.

- **Pathophysiology**: 
  - Symptoms worsen with activity but generally resolve with rest.
  - Most patients are symptom-free after adolescence; persistent symptoms in rare cases may require surgery.

## Diagnosis

### Clinical History
- **Symptoms** include:
  - Localized pain at the tibial tuberosity.
  - Exacerbated by knee extension activities (running, kicking, jumping, squatting, stairs).
  - Relieved by rest.

### Examination Findings
- Swelling/erythema around the patellar tendon or tibial tuberosity.
- Tenderness at the patellar tendon or tibial tuberosity.
- Prominence of the tibial tubercle.
- Pain on resisted knee extension.

### Investigations
- Clinical history usually sufficient for diagnosis.
- **X-ray**:
  - Early stages: Soft-tissue swelling around tibial tuberosity.
  - Late stages: Enlarged tibial tuberosity, irregular ossification, fragmentation, separate ossicle formation.
- **When to order X-ray**:
  - Unilateral, debilitating or persistent symptoms.
  - History of knee trauma.
- **Ultrasound/MRI**: To rule out other conditions (malignancy, infections).

## Management

### Prescribing
- **Self-limiting condition**; rest plus activity reduction are key.
- **NSAIDs for pain relief**:
  - **Ibuprofen**:
    - Children: 5-10 mg/kg every 6-8 hours (max 40 mg/kg/day).
    - Adults: 300-400 mg every 6-8 hours (max 2400 mg/day).
  - **Naproxen**:
    - Children > 2 years: 5 mg/kg every 12 hours.
    - Adults: 500 mg every 12 hours (max 1250 mg/day).

### Non-Prescribing
- Early management:
  - Advise reduction in sporting activity.
  - Using ice packs and compressive bandages to manage pain.
- Quadriceps weakness: Abstain from sports until pain resolves and strength improves.
- **Physiotherapy**: 
  - Focus on quadriceps and hamstring strengthening.
  - Improve knee joint flexibility.
- **Surgery**: Considered in severe, prolonged cases post-skeletal maturity.
