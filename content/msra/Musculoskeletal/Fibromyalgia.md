- **Definition**: Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by:
  - Fatigue
  - Widespread pain
  - Sleep disturbances
  - Psychiatric issues (e.g., cognitive dysfunction, depression, anxiety)

- **Prevalence**: 
  - Affects primarily women aged 20-55 (female to male ratio: 6:1)
  - Associated with gastrointestinal disorders (IBS, GERD)

- **Diagnosis**: 
  - Suspected with chronic widespread pain/multisite pain lasting â‰¥ 3 months.
  - Confirmed through detailed history and examination:
    - Tenderness in specific points (e.g., lower back, lateral epicondyle)
    - Joints are not tender; no swelling/redness noted
  - Important to differentiate from:
    - Rheumatoid arthritis
    - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
    - Spondyloarthritis
    - Connective tissue disorders

- **Investigations**: 
  - Normal lab findings: full blood counts, ESR, CRP
  - Consider serologic tests (ANA, RF) if rheumatic diseases suspected.
  - Polysomnogram may help identify sleep issues.
  - Blood pressure and heart rate monitoring for ANS dysfunction.

- **Management**:
  - **Pharmacological (for moderate symptoms)**:
    - **Tricyclic antidepressant** (e.g., Amitryptiline): Start at 10 mg nightly; increase slowly to max 75 mg.
    - **Muscle relaxant** (e.g., Cyclobenzaprine) based on symptoms.
    - Additional options if unresponsive (after 1-3 months):
      - **SNRI** (e.g., Duloxetine) for severe fatigue/depression.
      - **Anticonvulsants** (e.g., Pregabalin, Gabapentin) for severe sleep disturbances.
    - Combination therapy if needed.

  - **Non-Prescribing**:
    - Patient education about fibromyalgia.
    - Counseling for sleep and mood issues.
    - Exercise (cardiovascular, low-impact aerobic) beneficial for pain/sleep.
    - Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for pain management and relaxation.
