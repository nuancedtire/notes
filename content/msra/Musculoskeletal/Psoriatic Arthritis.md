Psoriatic arthritis (PA) is a chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal condition that primarily affects joints, causing swelling, pain, and stiffness. It often occurs alongside psoriasis and can worsen over time, potentially leading to a polyarticular pattern if untreated.

### Diagnosis

- **Commonly presents in:** Young to middle-aged individuals with a psoriasis history.
- **Key diagnostic elements:**
  - Clinical history and physical examination.
  - Recognizing inflammatory joint symptoms.

#### **Common Symptoms:**

- History of psoriasis.
- Morning joint stiffness lasting at least 30 minutes.
- Swelling of joints and/or digits (dactylitis).
- Foot pain after the first step in the morning.

If thereâ€™s no known psoriasis history, examine for signs of it, including:
- Pitted nails.
- Inflamed skin with silver-white plaques on scalp, elbows, knees, and limbs.

**Differentiation from RA:** Assess joint involvement pattern; check mobility and spine to exclude spondylitis.

### Investigations

- **X-rays:** For joint inflammation; assess the hands and feet for typical changes like:
  - Distal interphalangeal joint erosion.
  - Periarticular bone formation.
  
- **Advanced findings:** Pencil-in-cup deformity or arthritis mutilans in later stages.

- **Blood tests:** Check for elevated ESR and CRP (not specific for PA). Other initial tests include:
  - Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP).
  - Rheumatoid factor (RF).

- **MRI:** Can identify early sacroiliitis; abnormal findings may occur in asymptomatic patients.

### Management (Prescribing)

#### **Limited Peripheral Joint Disease:**

- **First-line:** 
  - NSAIDs (assess gastric ulcer risk; consider prescribing with Proton Pump Inhibitor like Omeprazole).
- **Adjuncts:**
  - Intra-articular corticosteroid injection.
  - Physiotherapy.

#### **Progressive Joint Disease/Spondylitis/Enthesitis:**

- **First-line:** 
  - DMARDs (e.g., methotrexate) + NSAIDs + physiotherapy/intra-articular corticosteroid injections.
- **Second-line:**
  - TNF-alpha inhibitor or monoclonal antibody + continued NSAIDs + physiotherapy.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Physiotherapy:** Daily sessions to improve joint movement, reduce pain, and strengthen muscles over time.
