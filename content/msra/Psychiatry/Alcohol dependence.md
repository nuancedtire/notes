## Dependence Syndrome Overview
- Definition: Psychological, behavioral, and cognitive features where a substance becomes a dominant feature in one's life (e.g., alcohol dependence = alcohol).

## Consequences
- Significant impacts on physical and psychological health, social circumstances.
- Requires thorough physical and psychological assessments.

## Management Approach
1. **Preventive Strategies**
2. **Psychological and Behavioral Interventions**
3. **Pharmacological Treatment**
   - Detoxification and management of complications.
   - Use of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions concurrently.

## Diagnosis
- Made clinically with the presence of three of the following six features in the past year:
  1. Strong desire to use the substance.
  2. Difficulty in controlling substance-taking behavior.
  3. Physiological withdrawal state upon reduction/cessation.
  4. Tolerance - needing increased use for similar effects.
  5. Salience - substance becomes the most important priority.
  6. Persistence despite harmful effects.
- Notable group risks: men, low socio-economic backgrounds, younger individuals, certain occupations (industrial workers, healthcare professionals).
- Validation tools (e.g., CAGE) available but not for formal diagnosis.

## Assessment Components
- Alcohol history: consumption patterns.
- Signs of dependence.
- Physical and mental health assessment.
- Family and social history.
- Patient's goals and attitude towards drinking.

## Investigations
- Clinical diagnosis supplemented by investigations for physical health problems:
  - FBC and haematinics (check for macrocytic anemia/nutritional deficiencies).
  - U&Es (baseline kidney function).
  - LFTs (screen for liver disease).
  - Elevated GGT levels (monitor alcohol consumption).
  - Urine and hair tests during detoxification.

## Pharmacological Management
- Medications for detox and withdrawal:
  - Benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide) during detox.
  - Anticonvulsants for seizures in acute alcohol withdrawal.
- Prophylactic thiamine (Pabrinex) to prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy.
- Long-term oral thiamine replacement for malnourishment.
- Maintenance drugs after abstinence:
  - Disulfiram - causes adverse effects if alcohol is consumed.
  - Acamprosate - reduces cravings, used post-detox.

## Non-Prescribing Management
- Psychological and behavioral interventions:
  - Types: counseling, CBT, family/couples therapy, motivational interviewing.
- Holistic management addressing:
  - Unemployment.
  - Financial troubles.
  - Relationship issues.
  - Criminality.
- Importance of social care workers in supporting the individual.
