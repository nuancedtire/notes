## Overview of Schizophrenia
- **Definition**: Serious mental health disorder characterized by recurrent psychosis (thought, perception, emotion, language, behavior disturbances).
- **Prevalence**: Affects approximately 1 in 100 people globally; most common psychosis type.
- **Forms**: Includes paranoid, hebephrenic, and catatonic schizophrenia; paranoid is the most common subtype.
- **Chronic Condition**: May relapse, untreated can have severe negative effects.

## Diagnosis
- **Criteria**: Based on clinical features; no definitive test. Utilizes DSM-V and ICD-10 criteria.
- **Key Symptoms (First-rank)**:
  - Delusions of thought interference (echo, insertion, withdrawal, broadcasting)
  - Passivity phenomena (perception of body control by external forces)
  - Auditory hallucinations (usually third-person commentary)
  - Persistent delusions (grandiose, paranoid, religious)

- **Symptom Categories**:
  - **Positive Symptoms**: Delusions/hallucinations (addition to normal experience).
  - **Negative Symptoms**: Loss of function (e.g., apathy, catatonia).

- **Evaluation**: Thorough psychiatric history and identification of symptoms needed for diagnosis.

## Investigations
- **Purpose**: Rule out organic causes of psychosis; no diagnostic tests for schizophrenia.
- **Recommended Investigations**:
  - Basic Blood Tests (FBC, U&Es)
  - Thyroid Function Tests
  - Calcium Level
  - Urinalysis (and MSU)
  - Urinary Drug Screen
  - Cranial Imaging (CT/MRI)

- **Long-term Monitoring**: ECGs for cardiac arrhythmias; blood tests for psychotropic drug toxicity.

## Emergency Management
- **Admission**: Patients with acute psychotic episodes often require emergency psychiatric admission.
- **Mental Health Act**: May require sectioning if insight is lacking.
- **Management Protocol**:
  - De-escalation techniques first.
  - Rapid tranquillisation: benzodiazepines, then antipsychotics (haloperidol, chlorpromazine, olanzapine).
  - Cardiovascular/respiratory risks must be considered.

- **Pharmacological Emergencies**:
  - **Agranulocytosis**: Risk with clozapine.
  - **Acute Dystonic Reactions**: Treated with antimuscarinics (e.g., benztropine).
  - **Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome**: Rare, life-threatening reaction.

## Management (Prescribing)
- **Antipsychotic Medications**: Strong evidence for their effectiveness; second-generation (atypical) drugs preferred.
- **Clozapine**: Reserved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
- **Mechanism and Side Effects**:
  - Act on D2 dopamine receptors.
  - Extrapyramidal side effects: dystonias, Parkinsonism, akathisia.
  - Anticholinergic effects: dry mouth, blurred vision.
  - Anti-adrenergic effects: postural hypotension, arrhythmias.
  
- **Dose Management**: Reduce to the lowest effective dose after acute phase; augmentation with antidepressants/mood stabilizers as needed.
- **Long-lasting Injections**: Depot injections for adherence.

## Management (Non-prescribing)
- **Community Management**: Psychiatrists and community psychiatric nurses offer ongoing support.
- **Psychotherapy**: Beneficial, particularly CBT in mood disorders.
- **Holistic Approach**: Emphasis on illness management and relapse recognition.

- **Cardiovascular Risk**: Regular assessments and lifestyle recommendations (diet, exercise).
- **Substance Misuse**: Co-morbid issues should be addressed with specific support and referral services.
