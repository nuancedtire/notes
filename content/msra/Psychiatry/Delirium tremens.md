Approximately half of patients with alcohol use disorder experience alcohol withdrawal upon reduction or cessation of drinking. While most cases are mild, about 20% experience severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome, which includes delirium tremens (DTs).

### Delirium Tremens (DTs)

- **Definition**: A rapid-onset, fluctuating disturbance of attention and cognition, often with hallucinations, occurring in alcohol withdrawal.
- **Mortality Rates**: Historically, untreated mortality rates reached as high as 37%.
- **Mechanism**: Alcohol is a CNS depressant; its withdrawal increases glutamate action, leading to excitatory symptoms seen in withdrawal syndromes.

### Diagnosis of Delirium Tremens

- **Onset**: Typically occurs 72-96 hours after the last drink, lasting up to 5 days.
- **Diagnostic Method**: Based on history and clinical examination identifying diagnostic criteria from DSM-5.

#### DSM-5 Criteria for Alcohol Withdrawal:

- **A**: Cessation or reduction of heavy, prolonged alcohol use.
- **B**: At least two of the following symptoms appearing within hours to days after reduction:
  1. Autonomic hyperactivity
  2. Increased hand tremor
  3. Insomnia
  4. Nausea or vomiting
  5. Hallucinations or illusions
  6. Psychomotor agitation
  7. Anxiety
  8. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures
- **C**: Distress or impairment in important areas of functioning due to symptoms.
- **D**: Symptoms are not due to another medical condition or better explained by another mental disorder.

#### Risk Factors for Diagnosis:

- History of DT
- Previous seizures
- Concurrent illnesses and comorbidities
- History of detoxification
- Prolonged period prior to last drink

#### Differential Diagnoses for Delirium Tremens:

- Sepsis
- Encephalitis
- Meningitis
- Hyperthermia
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

### Investigations

- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Mainly clinical; however, tests may identify comorbidities or alternative diagnoses.
- **Blood Tests**: Include venous blood gas, blood glucose, full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, and coagulation studies.
- **CT-Head**: May be necessary to rule out head injuries, particularly if seizures or altered consciousness are present.

### Management of Delirium Tremens

- **Emergency**: High mortality if untreated; requires high-dose benzodiazepines with intensive monitoring.
- **Resistant Cases**: For benzodiazepine-resistant DTs, transfer to intensive care for rapid tranquilization using midazolam, ketamine, or propofol.

#### Management (Prescribing)

- **First-Line Treatment**: Oral lorazepam.
- **If Persistent**: Use IV lorazepam.
- **Antipsychotic Use**: Haloperidol can be added after adequate benzodiazepine dosing without response.
- **Phenobarbital**: Consider if psychotic symptoms persist despite other treatments.

#### Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Monitoring**: Hourly checks until stable, including:
  - CIWA-Ar score to monitor drug response.
  - Blood glucose checks.
  - Vital signs using a scoring system like NEWS2.
- **Post-Discharge Prevention**:
  - Use tools like FAST or AUDIT-C to identify relapse potential.
  - Refer to community addiction services and support groups like AA.
  - Consider cognitive behavioral therapy and psychiatric referrals for underlying depression or anxiety.
