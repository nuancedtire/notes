## Panic Disorder Overview
- **Definition**: Recurrent unexpected panic attacks over a minimum of one month.
- **Impact**: Leads to worry about recurrence and implications on daily life.

## Panic Attacks
- **Symptoms**: Intense physical and cognitive anxiety symptoms; can be triggered or random.
- **Avoidance**: Patients may avoid situations that could trigger attacks.

## Aetiology
- **Factors**: Combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors.
- **Risk**: 5x higher if a first-degree relative has the disorder.
- **History**: Often preceded by life stressors or trauma.
- **Psychological Role**: Triggers can lead to hypervigilance and amplified panic responses.

## Pathophysiology
- **Neuroimaging**: Involvement of the amygdala, thalamus, hypothalamus, and hippocampus suggested.

## Prognosis
- **Remission Rates**: 96% at 2 years, 77% at 5 years, 67% at 7 years with treatment.

## Diagnosis
- **Methods**: Patient history, clinical interview, behavior observation.
- **Differentials**: Rule out specific phobias, medical conditions, or other mental disorders.

### DSM-5 Criteria for Panic Attack
- Recurrent unexpected panic attacks.
- One month of concern about further attacks or their implications.
- Behavioral change due to attacks (e.g., avoidance).
- Symptoms not attributable to substances or other conditions.

### Screening Tools
- **PRIME-MD**: Four-question panic screen.
- **GAD-7**: Assesses overall anxiety severity (not specific to panic disorder).

## Investigations
- **General**: Blood tests and imaging not routinely indicated for panic disorder.
- **Additional Tests**: Thyroid function, blood glucose, [[ECG]] for other symptoms; toxicology screen for substance-related issues.

## Emergency Management
### Symptoms of Panic Attack
- [[Palpitations]], sweating, shortness of breath, [[chest pain]], nausea, dizziness, fear of dying/losing control, numbness/tingling.

### Patient Management
- **During Attack**: Encourage deep breathing and remind the attack will pass; educate that attacks are not life-threatening.
- **ED Protocol**: Provide oxygen, monitor vitals, possibly perform an [[ECG]] if presenting with [[chest pain]], dyspnoea, or [[Palpitations]].

## Non-Prescribing Management
- **Education**: Reassure that panic attacks are frightening but not dangerous.
- **Monitoring**: Patients should track frequency, intensity, and duration of attacks.
- **Therapies**: First-line can be pharmacotherapy, self-help, or CBT.

### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- Aims to modify thoughts and behaviors related to panic.
- Controlled exposure to fear-inducing situations.
- 12-14 sessions typically beneficial.

## Prescribing Management
### Immediate Treatment
- Benzodiazepines for acute management, not used as monotherapy.

### First-Line Medications
- SSRIs (e.g., paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, citalopram) or SNRIs (e.g., venlafaxine).
- Effects may take up to 12 weeks.

### If No Improvement
- **Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)**: Consider after trying two SSRIs, noting potential adverse effects.
- **Duration**: Continue pharmacotherapy for 12 months post-treatment response to reduce relapse risk.
