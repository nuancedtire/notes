**Bulimia Nervosa Overview**

- **Characteristics**: Severe preoccupation with weight and body shape, recurrent binge eating, compensatory behaviors (e.g., self-induced vomiting).
- **Demographics**: More common in females (3:1 ratio), median age of onset at 20 years.
- **Body Weight**: Usually within or above normal range; diet restriction often occurs between binge episodes.

**Co-morbid Psychopathology**:
- Anxiety disorders
- Body dysmorphic disorder
- Depressive disorders
- Posttraumatic stress disorder
- Substance use disorders

### Diagnosis
**Core Features**:
1. **Binge Eating**: Eating excessive food (e.g., >1000 kcal) with a sense of loss of control.
2. **Compensatory Behaviors**: 
   - Self-induced vomiting
   - Laxative misuse
   - Diuretic misuse
   - Fasting
   - Excessive exercise
3. Occurrence: Binge eating plus compensatory behaviors at least once a week for three months.
4. Excessive concern about body weight and shape.

**Typical Behavior Sequence**:
- Caloric restriction → Binge eating → Self-induced vomiting.

**Signs Observed in Clinical Examination**:
- Dental erosion
- Parotid hypertrophy
- Russell's sign (scarring on hands)
- Cardiac arrhythmias (due to electrolyte abnormalities)

### Investigations
- **No definitive lab tests**; screens for complications:
  - FBC
  - Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, Bicarbonate
  - AST, Alkaline phosphatase
  - Magnesium, Phosphorus
  - B12, RBC folate, Ferritin
  - Urinalysis, Pregnancy test, ECG

- **DEXA**: Not routine but may be requested for bone loss concerns.

**Common Complications**:
- Dehydration
- Hypokalaemia
- Hypochloraemia
- Metabolic alkalosis

### Management
**Pharmacologic**:
- SSRIs/SNRIs as primary treatment, usually combined with psychotherapy.
- **First-line**: Fluoxetine; alternative: Sertraline for intolerance.

**Non-pharmacologic**:
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Optimal primary treatment.
- **Nutritional Support**: Involvement of registered dietitian to normalize intake and maintain weight.
- **Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT)**: Effective in reducing binge-eating episodes by addressing dysfunctional thoughts and involving family support.
