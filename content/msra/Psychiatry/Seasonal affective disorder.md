## Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)

- **Definition**: SAD is a type of depression with a seasonal pattern, primarily occurring in winter, also known as "winter depression." Symptoms recur at the same time each year and remit outside these periods.

- **Classification**: Classified under 'recurrent depressive disorder' in the ICD-10; controversial as some consider it a form of atypical depression.

- **Causes**: Not well understood, but believed to relate to:
  - Reduced sunlight exposure
  - Deficiencies in melatonin and serotonin production
  - Disruption of Circadian rhythms 

## Diagnosis

- **Clinical Features**:
  - Mild to moderate depression symptoms (low mood, anhedonia, fatigue, sleep disturbances, feelings of guilt/hopelessness)
  - Symptoms must have a seasonal pattern. 
  - Increased appetite, especially for carbohydrates.
  
- **Considerations**: If no seasonal pattern is present, it may be another type of depression.

## Investigations

- **Diagnosis**: Primarily clinical but require ruling out organic causes mimicking SAD (e.g., endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism, Cushingâ€™s syndrome).
  
- **Standard Tests**:
  - FBC, U&Es, LFTs, TFTs, glucose, calcium profiles, and haematinics.
  
- **Further Investigations**: If symptoms persist or there are red flags, consider toxicology screens, extended electrolyte profiles, endocrine/hormone profiles, and imaging (CT/MRI, EEG).

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **First-line Treatment**: Non-pharmacological approaches:
  - Increase natural sunlight exposure (e.g., daytime walks).
  - Create bright home/work environments.
  - Regular exercise and a balanced diet are also vital.

- **SAD-Specific Interventions**:
  - Light therapy (using specialized lightboxes for 30 minutes to 2 hours daily).
  - Lightboxes commercially available but not typically provided by the NHS.

- **Psychological Interventions**: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), counselling, and psychodynamic therapy.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Severe Cases**: May be treated with antidepressants, although evidence supporting efficacy is limited.
  
- **Preferred Medications**:
  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
  - Alternatives: Propranolol (in the morning before sunrise), melatonin or agomelatine (at night).
