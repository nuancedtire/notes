## PTSD Overview

- **Definition**: PTSD develops after exposure to a traumatic event (single or multiple).
- **Examples of Traumatic Events**: Severe accidents, disasters, violence, military action.
- **Causative Factor**: Attributed to an external trauma; requires actual or threatened death, serious injury, or threat to physical integrity.

## Theories of PTSD

1. **Emotional Processing Theory**:
   - Fear structures in memory lead to cognitive, behavioral, and physiological reactions.
   - In PTSD, these become pathological, misinterpreting stimuli as dangerous.
  
2. **Dual Representation Theory**:
   - Differentiates between types of memories.
   - Situational memories become unconscious until triggered, causing symptoms.
  
3. **Cognitive Model**:
   - Negative appraisals result in viewing the world as dangerous and oneself as incompetent.

## Pathophysiology

- **Hippocampal Size**: Observed reduction in size.
- **Amygdala Activity**: Regulation failure leads to hyper-reactivity and oversensitivity.

## Diagnosis (DSM-5 Criteria)

- **Four Symptom Groups** (must impair function for diagnosis):
  1. **Intrusiveness**: Re-experiencing traumatic aspects (flashbacks, nightmares).
  2. **Avoidance**: Avoiding reminders of the trauma (people, situations, media).
  3. **Negative Alterations**: Amnesia, negative beliefs, trauma-related emotions, loss of interest in activities.
  4. **Alterations in Arousal and Reactivity**: Hypervigilance, startle responses, irritability, sleep problems, concentration issues.

- **Duration**: Symptoms must be present for at least one month; delayed presentation is common.

## Investigations

- **Questionnaires and Checklists**:
  - PTSD Checklist for DSM-5: 20 self-report questions.
  - Impact of Event Scale â€“ Revised (IES-R): 22 items measuring intrusion, avoidance, hyper-arousal.
  - Trauma Screening Questionnaire (TSQ): 10 items on re-experiencing and arousal.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- Some may recover without intervention; those who don't have a higher risk of chronic issues.
- **Support**: Practical, social, and emotional support from health and social workers is essential.
- **Psychological Therapy Options**:
  - CBT
  - Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TFCBT)
  - Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)

- TFCBT recommended for severe symptoms or symptoms lasting over 3 months; 8-12 sessions typically.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Antidepressants (SSRIs)**: Reduce severity of PTSD symptoms and associated depression.
- **Start Delay**: SSRIs should begin after initiating psychological treatment, unless:
  - Patient prefers not to engage in therapy.
  - Unable to start due to ongoing trauma risk (e.g., domestic violence).
  - Has not responded to or tolerated therapy.
  - Treating comorbid depression.

- **Effective SSRIs**: Paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine (SNRI).
- **Non-Responsive Patients**: Increase dose or switch medications; consider risperidone to augment SSRI treatment.
- **Duration**: Continue medication for at least 12 months post-response; gradual withdrawal over 4 weeks to avoid relapse.
