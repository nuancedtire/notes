Korsakoff’s psychosis is a component of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a neurologic condition arising from thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency.

### Wernicke Encephalopathy
- **Description**: Acute neurologic disorder characterized by:
  - Encephalopathy
  - Oculomotor dysfunction
  - Gait ataxia

### Korsakoff’s Psychosis
- **Description**: Late neuropsychiatric manifestation of Wernicke encephalopathy, marked by:
  - Global amnesia (antero- and retrograde amnesia)
  - Fixation amnesia
  - Confabulation (fabricating false memories due to memory gaps)
  - Lack of insight
  - Apathy (lack of interest and indifference)

- **Prevalence**: Common in alcohol abusers; 80% of untreated Wernicke cases develop Korsakoff’s psychosis. Can be caused by:
  - Malabsorption
  - Poor dietary intake
  - Dialysis

### Pathophysiology
- Thiamine is crucial for pyruvate decarboxylation. Its deficiency can damage:
  - Medial thalamus
  - Mammillary bodies (posterior hypothalamus)
  - Cause cerebral atrophy
- Affects areas involved in emotion and memory (limbic system).

### Diagnosis
- **Requirements**: History of severe chronic alcohol dependence plus:
  - Anterograde amnesia
  - Retrograde amnesia
  - Fixation amnesia
  - Confabulation 
  - Lack of insight
  - Apathy
  - Preserved attention and social behavior

- **Risk Factors**:
  - Alcohol abuse
  - Chemotherapy
  - Dialysis
  - Rapid weight loss
  - Reduced BMI
  - Anemia
  - Pellagra

### Investigations
- No specific tests for diagnosis but may include:
  - Full blood count (CBC)
  - ESR/CRP (to rule out encephalitis)
  - Liver function tests
  - Imaging for cerebral atrophy/ventricular expansion (not routinely performed).

### Emergency Management
- **Condition**: Wernicke encephalopathy is a medical emergency; untreated mortality rate of up to 20%.
- **Symptoms**: Can include petechial hemorrhagic necrosis and deficits in mentation, oculomotor function, and gait ataxia.
- **Management**: Prompt thiamine administration improves prognosis.

### Treatment
- **Prescribing**:
  - Thiamine replacement (IV or IM), provide proper nutrition/hydration.
  - If glucose administered, ensure thiamine is given first to prevent cell damage.
  - Typical regimen: Pabrinex® I/V High Potency, 2–3 pairs 3 times daily for 3–5 days, then 1 pair daily as needed.

- **Non-Prescribing**:
  - 25% cases reversible; 25% may need long-term care.
  - Recovery is often slow and incomplete.
  - Multidisciplinary management (neurologist, mental health nurse, etc.) is essential.
  - Education for patients/family is vital.

### Prevention
- **Strategy**: Avoid vitamin B/thiamine deficiency.
