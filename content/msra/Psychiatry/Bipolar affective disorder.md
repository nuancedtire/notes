## Bipolar Affective Disorder Overview

- **Formerly known as:** Manic depression
- **Prevalence:** Relatively common, severe psychiatric disorder
- **Characteristics:** Alternating periods of low mood (depression) and high mood (mania/hypomania)
- **Onset:** Typically in late adolescence or early adulthood
- **Risk Factors:** 
  - Strong family history
  - Traumatic life events
  - Co-morbid psychiatric illnesses
  - Substance misuse
- **Ethnic/Gender Prevalence:** No specific preponderance

## Diagnosis

- **Types:**
  - **Bipolar I Disorder:** At least one manic/hypomanic episode; two mood disturbances with recovery in between
  - **Bipolar II Disorder:** One or more depressive episodes with at least one hypomanic episode
  - **Cyclothymia:** Frequent rotation between hypomanic and depressive episodes

- **Manic Episode Features:**
  - Persistently elevated mood
  - Requires at least three of the following:
    - Elevated mood, increased energy, reduced inhibitions
    - Attention span reduction, risk-taking behavior, functional interference
  - May include psychotic symptoms (grandiose/paranoid delusions)
  - Loss of insight, self-neglect risk

- **Hypomania:** Less severe, no psychotic symptoms, better daily functioning, shorter duration

- **Diagnosis Process:**
  - Thorough psychiatric assessment
  - Exclude differential diagnoses (e.g., schizophrenia, personality disorders)
  - Rule out neurological and endocrine conditions
  - Consider infections or substance-induced manic symptoms

## Investigations 

- **No specific diagnostic test**, but important to exclude organic causes:
  - **Blood Tests:** FBC (infection screening), U&Es (electrolytes), endocrine screen, calcium profile, toxicology
  - **Urine Sampling:** Toxicology and infection screening
  - **Imaging:** CT or MRI if neurological cause suspected
  - **ECG:** Routine due to arrhythmia risk from medications

## Management

### Pharmacological

- **Acute Episodes:**
  - **Mania:** Atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine)
  - **Depression:** SSRIs with caution (may induce mania), antipsychotics for augmentation

- **Prophylactic Treatment:**
  - Mood stabilizers (lithium, atypical antipsychotics, antiepileptic drugs like sodium valproate, lamotrigine)
  - Start at low doses, titrate up after remission of episodes
  - **Risks:** Close monitoring for lithium (renal/thyroid toxicity), teratogenicity for women of child-bearing age

### Non-Pharmacological

- **Patient Education:** Key for long-term management
  - Understanding illness to reduce recurrence
  - **Triggers:** 
    - Acute illness, stress, drugs/alcohol, lack of sleep, significant life events, trauma, childbirth, certain medications

- **Psychological Interventions:** Effective during remission (e.g., CBT, interpersonal therapy, family therapy)

- **Electroconvulsive Therapy:** Last resort for severe refractory episodes

- **Outpatient Management:** Suitable in most cases; inpatient admission for severe episodes is necessary to prevent self-harm or risk to others.

- **Support:** Addressing stigma, enhancing self-esteem, managing interpersonal difficulties, and supporting through support groups.
