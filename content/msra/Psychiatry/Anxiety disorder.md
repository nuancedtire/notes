### Diagnosis
- **Clinical diagnosis criteria (ICD-10):** minimum of four symptoms present for most days for at least six months:
  - **Autonomic arousal:**
    - Palpitations
    - Sweating
    - Tremor
    - Dry mouth
  - **Physical symptoms:**
    - Shortness of breath
    - Choking sensation
    - [[Chest pain]]
    - Nausea
    - Dysphagia
  - **Mental state symptoms:**
    - Pre-syncope
    - Derealisation/depersonalisation
    - Fears of losing control or dying
    - Insomnia
    - Irritability
  - **Tension symptoms:**
    - Muscle tension/aches
    - Restlessness
    - Feeling on edge
    - Exaggerated startle response
  - **Cognitive symptoms:**
    - Difficulty concentrating
    - Poor memory
- **Screening tool:** GAD-7 (score: 5=mild, 10=moderate, 15=severe).
- **Diagnosis of exclusion:** important to rule out other psychiatric or physical health conditions.

### Investigations
- Generally not needed for diagnosis but used to exclude physical causes.
- **Routine blood tests:** FBC, U&Es, TFTs (especially to rule out hyperthyroidism).
- **Cardiac investigations:** ECG as necessary.
- **Respiratory investigations:** depending on symptoms.

### Management (Pharmacological)
- **First-line treatment:** SSRIs (sertraline preferred).
- **Alternatives:** Another SSRI or SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine), neuropathic agents (pregabalin).
- **Benzodiazepines:** Not for long-term use; only for short-term in crisis situations.

### Management (Non-Pharmacological)
- **Mild cases:** Low-intensity interventions (self-help, education, support groups).
- **Severe cases or non-response:** High-intensity interventions (individual CBT, relaxation therapy).
- **Patient education:** Critical for understanding and managing the illness.
- **Referral to secondary services:** Indicated for:
  - Risk of self-harm/suicide
  - Significant psychiatric comorbidities (substance misuse, depression)
  - Self-neglect
  - Failure of response to initial measures.
- **Specialist management:** Combination drug treatments or augmentation with antidepressants/antipsychotics, initiated by psychiatrist.
