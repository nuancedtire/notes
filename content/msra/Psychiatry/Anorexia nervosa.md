Anorexia nervosa (anorexia) is an eating disorder characterized by:

- Distortion of body image
- Strong desire to be thin
- Self-induced weight loss
- Low body weight

**Key Points:**

- Most common in young women, typically onset during adolescence but can affect all ages, including men and boys.
- Significant mortality (around 10%) associated with untreated anorexia due to physical complications and suicide risk.
  
**Diagnosis:**

- Made clinically via a full psychiatric and medical history.
- Differential diagnoses include:
  - Depression
  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder
  - Brain tumors
  - Gastrointestinal disorders
  - Drug-related loss of appetite

**Physical Complications:**
- Dental issues due to vomiting
- Hypotension
- Cardiac arrhythmias
- Delayed gastric emptying
- Endocrine disorders (e.g., amenorrhea)
- Electrolyte disorders
- Infertility
- Dry skin/hair and lanugo hair
- Peripheral neuropathy
- Cerebral atrophy
- Hematological disorders (e.g., anemia)

**Diagnostic Criteria:**
- Low body weight: BMI â‰¤ 17.5 or > 15% below expected weight
- Self-induced weight loss (e.g., dietary restrictions, purging)
- Body image distortion: fear of being overweight
- Endocrine disruptions (e.g., amenorrhea)
- Delayed puberty (if onset is pre-pubertal)

**Investigations:**
- Aimed at assessing physical complications.
- Evaluations include:
  - Weight and height for BMI calculation
  - Electrocardiograms (for arrhythmias risk)
  - Blood tests:
    - FBC (anemia screening)
    - ESR (to rule out other causes of weight loss)
    - U&Es (evaluate dehydration and electrolyte imbalances)
    - Glucose (check for hypoglycemia)
    - TFTs (thyroid dysfunction)
    - Endocrine screen (GH, PRL, LH, FSH, estrogen, progesterone)

**Management (Prescribing):**
- Mainly non-pharmacological treatment.
- SSRI fluoxetine may be beneficial for obsessional thoughts regarding food.
- Medical management for physical complications (e.g., calcium/vitamin D for osteopenia, hormone replacement for estrogen deficiency).

**Management (Non-Prescribing):**
- Most managed as outpatients; hospitalization for severe cases.
- Criteria for admission include:
  - Extreme weight loss not responding to outpatient treatment
  - Severe electrolyte disturbances
  - Significant bradycardia or hypotension
  - Cardiac complications
  - Severe malnutrition effects on mental status
  - Psychosis
  - Suicide risk
  
- Admission decisions involve patients and families, with legal considerations (e.g., The Children Act 1989) affecting minors. The Mental Capacity Act may apply for enforced feeding in life-threatening situations.

**Psychological Treatments:**
- Family therapy
- Individualized therapies (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy)
- Educational approaches (self-help, nutritional education)
