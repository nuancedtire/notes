Papilloedema is characterized by swelling of the optic disc due to raised intracranial pressure, primarily affecting the optic nerve. It is typically bilateral, developing over hours to weeks, and is considered a medical emergency due to potential life-threatening causes.

## Causes of Papilloedema
- Hypercapnia
- Malignant hypertension
- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
- Space-occupying lesions

## Diagnosis
### Symptoms and Signs
- Diplopia
- Visual acuity changes
- Morning headache
- Vomiting
- Loss of consciousness

### Differential Diagnoses
- Congenitally crowded discs
- Optic disc drusen
- Tilted optic discs

## Investigations
1. **Physical Examination**: Includes blood pressure check to exclude malignant hypertension.
2. **Ophthalmic Examination**:
   - Fundal examination
   - Visual acuity assessment
   - Ocular motility check
   - Pupillary examination
   - Visual fields assessment

### Signs on Examination
- Loss of optic cup
- Paton's lines
- Blurring of optic disc margins
- Elevation of optic disc
- Reduced venous pulsation
- Venous engorgement

### Imaging
- CT scan or MRI to rule out intracranial lesions, hemorrhages, infarctions, or hydrocephalus.
- Lumbar puncture to assess CSF pressure, if no mass is present.

## Emergency Management
- Quick diagnosis essential to prevent irreversible nerve damage and vision loss.
- Refer symptomatic patients to neurology-on-call for urgent treatment.
- Non-symptomatic patients should be referred urgently to ophthalmology or neurology.

## Management (Prescribing)
- If idiopathic intracranial hypertension is diagnosed, consider prescribing:
  - Acetazolamide to reduce CSF production or a diuretic.
  - Pain relief options like topiramate, which may assist with weight loss if relevant.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)
- For papilloedema caused by space-occupying lesions, surgical intervention may resolve the condition within 6-8 weeks.
- Tumor biopsies may be necessary, along with potential follow-up therapies like radiotherapy.
- Repeated spinal taps may be required for idiopathic intracranial hypertension; duration for resolution may vary.
- Weight loss may benefit idiopathic intracranial hypertension patients. Once vision loss begins, it may become permanent within days without effective treatment.
