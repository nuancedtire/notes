- **Definition of Stroke:**
  - Acute neurological deficit(s) lasting ≥ 24 hours.
  - Subclassified into:
    - **Haemorrhagic Stroke:** Bleeding due to ruptured blood vessel.
    - **Ischaemic Stroke:** Occlusion or significant stenosis of blood vessels (over 80% of cases).
  - **Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA):** Acute neurological deficit(s) resolving < 24 hours.

### **Diagnosis:**
- Perform ABCDE assessment and thorough neurological evaluation.
- Symptoms vary based on the affected brain region.

#### **Bamford Classification of Ischaemic Stroke:**
1. **Total Anterior Circulation Stroke:** 
   - Affected Region: Cortex (middle & anterior cerebral arteries).
   - Symptoms: 
     - Unilateral weakness (face, arm, leg)
     - Homonymous hemianopia
     - Higher cerebral dysfunction (dysphasia, visuospatial disorder)

2. **Partial Anterior Circulation Stroke:**
   - Affected Region: Cortex (anterior cerebral arteries).
   - Symptoms: Two of three:
     - Unilateral weakness (face, arm, leg)
     - Homonymous hemianopia
     - Higher cerebral dysfunction (dysphasia, visuospatial disorder)

3. **Posterior Circulation Syndrome:**
   - Affected Region: Cerebellum & brainstem (posterior circulation).
   - Symptoms: One of:
     - Cranial nerve palsy + contralateral motor/sensory deficit
     - Bilateral motor/sensory deficit
     - Conjugate eye movement disorder
     - Cerebellar dysfunction (vertigo, ataxia)
     - Isolated homonymous hemianopia

4. **Lacunar Stroke:**
   - Affected Region: Subcortical areas (small vessel disease).
   - Symptoms: No loss of higher cerebral functions, with one of:
     - Pure sensory stroke
     - Pure motor stroke
     - Sensori-motor stroke
     - Ataxic hemiparesis

### **Risk Factors:**
- **Ischaemic Stroke:** Family history, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, elderly, [[atrial fibrillation]], carotid artery stenosis, hyperlipidaemia, sickle cell disease, hypercoagulopathies.
- **Haemorrhagic Stroke:** Family history, hypertension, haemophilia, elderly, alcohol abuse, anticoagulation, vascular malformation, illicit substance use, cerebral amyloid angiopathy.
- **TIA:** Family history, hypertension, smoking, [[atrial fibrillation]], elderly, valvular disease, diabetes, carotid artery stenosis, alcohol abuse.

### **Investigations:**
#### **First-Line for Ischaemic Strokes:**
- Non-contrast head CT scan (ASAP).
- Serum tests:
  - Full blood count
  - Urea and electrolytes
  - Creatinine, glucose, troponin, prothrombin time, INR (if on Warfarin).
- ECG.

#### **Other Investigations:**
- Serum toxicology screen.
- CT/MR angiography (if eligible for thrombectomy).
- Carotid ultrasound.

### **Management:**
#### **General Considerations:**
- Refer suspected stroke patients to a specialist stroke team.

#### **Ischaemic Stroke Management:**
1. Thrombolysis (alteplase) if within 4.5 hours of symptom onset (with specialist support).
2. Thrombectomy:
   - Within 6 hours for proximal anterior circulation occlusion.
   - 6 to 24 hours (e.g., “wake-up strokes”) if salvageable brain tissue.
3. Aspirin (300 mg) within 24 hours, for 2 weeks, followed by long-term antiplatelet therapy.
4. Consider gastroprotection (PPI).
5. Early rehabilitation: physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy.
6. Nasogastric tubes for dysphagia, with a swallow assessment.

#### **Haemorrhagic Stroke Management:**
- Supportive care.
- Blood pressure management:
  - Rapid lowering for systolic 150-220 mmHg within 6 hours.
  - Case-by-case decisions for systolic > 220 mmHg or outside 6 hours.
