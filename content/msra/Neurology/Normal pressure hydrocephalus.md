- **Definition**: Normal-pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is characterized by a triad:
  - **Wet**: Urinary incontinence
  - **Wacky**: Dementia
  - **Wobbly**: Gait disturbance
- **Associated Features**: Enlarged ventricles, normal intracranial pressure.

- **Types of Hydrocephalus**:
  - **Communicating Hydrocephalus**:
    - Due to reduced CSF absorption or increased CSF production.
  - **Non-Communicating Hydrocephalus**:
    - Caused by obstruction of CSF exit from ventricles.

- **Cause of NPH**:
  - Chronic form of communicating hydrocephalus.
  - Often arises due to reduced CSF absorption via arachnoid villi.
  - May follow meningitis, head injuries, or subarachnoid hemorrhages.

- **Demographics**: Predominantly affects patients over 60 years, characterized by gradual ventricular dilation.

### **Diagnosis**:
- 60% present with the full triad at diagnosis.
- Symptoms develop over several months:
  - Initial: Increased micturition urgency and frequency.
  - Gait: Ataxic (broad-based, short steps) leading to worsening incontinence.
  - Dementia: Often reversible.
- **Absence of Increased Intracranial Pressure**: No signs present.

### **Investigations**:
- Rule out other causes of cognitive dysfunction.
- Assess vitamin B12 and thyroid functions.
- **CT Imaging**:
  - Shows enlarged ventricles without sulcal enlargement.
- **CSF Tap Test**:
  - Normal/slightly raised opening pressure.
  - Improvement of symptoms after fluid extraction.

### **Management (Prescribing)**:
- Definitive therapy: Ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
- Pharmacological options before shunt:
  - Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide).
  - Diuretics.

### **Management (Non-Prescribing)**:
- **Ventriculoperitoneal Shunting**: Main treatment method.
  - Drains excess CSF into the peritoneum.
- **Complications**:
  - Over drainage
  - Shunt infection
  - Under drainage
- Approximately 10% may experience additional complications such as:
  - Seizures
  - Hemorrhage
  - Infection
