Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a neurological emergency caused by cauda equina compressionâ€”a collection of lumbosacral spinal nerves beyond the spinal cord termination at L1/L2. Common causes include lumbar disc prolapse, spinal tumors/metastases, infections, inflammation, trauma, and hematomas. Untreated, CES can result in long-term paralysis and significant bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. Urgent treatment based on clinical suspicion is essential.

## Diagnosis
Diagnosis is confirmed via MRI showing cauda equina compression, but urgent treatment may begin based on clinical signs and symptoms, which include:

- Severe lower back pain
- Leg weakness
- Radicular leg pain
- Urinary retention
- Urinary incontinence and fecal incontinence
- Sexual dysfunction

**Examination Findings:**
- Saddle anesthesia (perineum/perianal area; S3-S5)
- Loss of anal tone
- Reduced lower limb power
- Absent ankle reflexes

Red flags include severe back pain, bilateral leg weakness/radiculopathy, saddle anesthesia, and incontinence.

## Investigations
- **Gold Standard:** MRI of the spine. 
- **Alternative:** CT scan if MRI unavailable.
- Identify underlying causes (e.g., disc prolapse, malignancy, infection, etc.).
- Additional investigations may include CT-TAP and PET scans for malignancy or lumbar puncture/blood cultures if infection is suspected.
- **Bedside bladder scan** for urinary retention can support CES diagnosis.

## Emergency Diagnosis and Management
CES can lead to permanent disability if untreated. Management depends on the cause:
- **Compressive Lesion:** Emergency decompression surgery with transfer to a neurosurgical unit.
- **Inflammatory/Malignant Causes:** High-dose corticosteroids.
- **Infective Causes:** Urgent intravenous antibiotics.

## Management (Prescribing)
- **Medical Management:**
  - Malignant: High-dose corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone).
  - Infective: Intravenous antibiotics.
  - Consider PPI cover and bisphosphonates during steroid treatment for gastric and bone protection.
  - Thromboprophylaxis due to reduced mobility.
  - Supportive management: Adequate analgesia.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Definitive Management:**
  - Decompressive surgery (laminectomy for disc prolapse, tumor excision, hematoma drainage).
  - Individual assessment for surgical suitability.
  - Malignant CES may require radiotherapy.

**Long-term Management:**
- Extensive neuro-rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy).
- Regular nursing care for significant disabilities.
- Management of bladder/bowel dysfunction may include long-term catheters and continence pads.
