## Myasthenia Gravis (MG)

### Overview
- **Characterization**: Muscle weakness with fatigability; improves with rest and anticholinesterase drugs.
- **Typical Onset**: 
  - 20-30 years (common)
  - After age 70 (in men)
- **Demographics**: Higher incidence in men and Afro-Caribbean heritage.
- **Associated Auto-immune Diseases**:
  - Graves'
  - Rheumatoid arthritis
  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
  - Vitiligo
  - Pernicious anemia
  - Addison’s disease

### Pathophysiology
- **Cause**: Antibodies block postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Type II hypersensitivity reaction).
- **Impact**: Reduced functioning receptors → diminished neurological transmission to muscles → fatigability.
- **Thymic Findings**: 
  - 70% have thymic hyperplasia.
  - 15% associated with thymoma (particularly over age 40).

### Diagnosis
- **Common Complaints**: Fatigability; often stronger in the morning.
- **Initial Presentations**: Ocular and bulbar muscle involvement (ophthalmoplegia, squints, ptosis).
- **Generalized MG Symptoms** (after about 1 year in some patients):
  - Myasthenic snarl (loss of facial expression)
  - Dysphonia
  - Dysarthria
  - Trunk and axial weakness
  - Difficulties in chewing or swallowing
- **Myasthenic Crisis**: Respiratory muscle weakness, can be fatal; precipitated by:
  - Infection
  - Emotional/physiological stress
  - Certain drugs (beta-blockers, gentamicin, tetracyclines, macrolides, phenytoin, lithium, opioids)

### Investigations
- **Antibody Tests**: 
  - 90% have positive antibodies to acetylcholine receptors.
  - Less frequent in patients with only ocular symptoms.
  - 40% may have anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies (MUSK).
- **Nerve Conduction Studies**: Show decreasing response with repeated stimulation and ‘jitter’.
- **CT imaging**: To exclude thymic mass.
- **Screening**: For associated auto-immune diseases.
- **Tensilon Test**: Historically used, not commonly done due to cardiac risks.

### Management
#### Prescribing
- **First-line Medications**:
  - Long-acting anticholinergic inhibitors (neostigmine, pyridostigmine).
  - Prednisolone for symptomatic relief (including isolated ocular symptoms).
- **Crisis Management**: Plasma exchange for respiratory weakness or severe symptoms despite therapy.

#### Non-prescribing
- **Thymectomy**: For patients without thymus issues.
- **Ventilation**: May be necessary in crisis situations.
- **Prognosis**: With treatment, most patients have a good life expectancy.
