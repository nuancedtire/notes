## Epilepsy Overview
- **Definition**: Chronic neurological disorder with recurrent unprovoked seizures.
- **Prevalence**: 1 in 200 people in the UK; common neurological condition.
- **Etiology**:
  - **Idiopathic**: Most common cause, with a genetic component.
  - **Secondary Causes**: Cerebrovascular disease, brain tumors, alcohol excess, traumatic head injury.
- **Management**: Typically well-controlled with anti-epileptic medication. 

## Diagnosis
- **Clinical Features**: Based on seizure characteristics and exclusion of other causes.
- **Seizure Types**:
  - **Generalised Seizures**: Excessive electrical activity throughout the brain (e.g., tonic-clonic, myoclonic, absence).
  - **Focal Seizures**: Localized brain activity (further divided into simple and complex).
  
### Diagnostic Features
- Distinguishing features of epileptic seizures:
  - Tongue-biting
  - Incontinence
  - Tonic-clonic limb activity
  - Auditory/sensory/olfactory auras
  - Postictal fatigue/confusion

- **Patterned Seizures**: Patients experience different types of seizures, but patterns remain consistent.
- **Diagnostic Process**: History taking, collateral input, video evidence, neurological examination.

## Investigations
- Primarily clinical diagnosis; investigations required to identify causes and set treatment baselines.
- **Key Tests**:
  - **Electroencephalogram (EEG)**: Essential for diagnosing and classifying epilepsy.
  - **Blood Tests**: 
    - Full Blood Count (FBC)
    - Urea & Electrolytes (U&Es)
    - Liver Function Tests (LFTs)
    - Calcium profile
    - Glucose levels 
- **Imaging**: MRI scans for suspected lesions (e.g., mesial temporal sclerosis).

## Emergency Management
- **Status Epilepticus**: Continuous seizures or two or more seizures without recovery.
  - Management includes:
    - Airway protection (nasotracheal preferred).
    - Immediate administration of rectal diazepam or IV lorazepam.
    - Additional medications if seizures persist (e.g., phenytoin, phenobarbital).
- **Patient Education**: Risks of status epilepticus and effective first aid measures.

### Special Considerations
- **SUDEP**: Sudden unexplained death related to seizure activity; rare but requires counseling for risk management.

## Management (Prescribing)
- **Anti-epileptic Medications**: Numerous options with specific side effects and monitoring needs. 
- **First-line Agents**:
  - Sodium valproate: preferred for generalised epilepsy.
  - Lamotrigine: preferred for focal epilepsy (especially in women of childbearing age).
- Other options: Levetiracetam, topiramate, clobazam, zonisamide, etc.
- **Emergency Treatments**: Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam), older drugs like phenytoin less commonly used today.

## Management (Non-prescribing)
- **Patient Education**: Critical to avoid triggers (alcohol, drugs, sleep deprivation, stress).
- **Counseling on Safety**: Advising against unsafe activities (e.g., diving, solo sports).
- **Driving Regulations**: Inform DVLA; restrictions apply post-seizure.
  
### Non-Drug Interventions
- **Surgery**: Possible for surgically resectable lesions; may include temporal lobe surgeries.
- **Vagal Nerve Stimulation**: An option for refractory epilepsy not suitable for surgery.
