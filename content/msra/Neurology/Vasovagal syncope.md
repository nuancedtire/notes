Vasovagal syncope is the most common cause of fainting, characterized by a sudden loss of consciousness due to reflexive bradycardia and peripheral vasodilatation. This leads to reduced venous return to the heart, causing a neural response mediated by the vagus nerve, resulting in further vasodilatation and bradycardia, ultimately dropping blood pressure and causing syncope. Common triggers include emotion, fear, pain, and prolonged standing. It is a type of neurally-mediated syncope.

## Diagnosis

- **History & Symptoms**: Typical history involves a trigger followed by a sudden, brief loss of consciousness and rapid recovery. Pre-syncopal symptoms may include:
  - Dizziness
  - Sweating
  - Pallor
  - Nausea

- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Primarily clinical but requires ruling out other syncope causes. History should exclude signs indicative of:
  - Epileptic seizures (incontinence, tongue biting)
  - Cardiac syncope (exertional syncope, cardiac prodrome)
- **Family History**: Consider further investigation for inherited arrhythmias or cardiomyopathies if there's a family history of sudden cardiac death.

## Investigations

Diagnosis may be clinical, but further investigations may be required:
- **Basic Bloods**: FBC, U&Es to rule out infection and dehydration.
- **ECG**: To check for cardiac causes; consider 24-hour tape if arrhythmia is suspected.
- **Echocardiogram**: If cardiac causes are suspected.
- **EEG**: If epilepsy is suspected.
- **Cranial Imaging**: CT/MRI if neurological causes are suspected.
- **Tilt Table Tests**: To differentiate forms of neurally-mediated syncope.

Basic bloods and an ECG suffice in most cases, with other tests considered if necessary.

## Management (Pharmacological)

- **General Treatment**: Often not necessary; focus is on identifying and avoiding triggers.
- **Medication**: Consider if recurrent episodes persist despite non-pharmacological interventions.
  - **Drugs**:
    - **Fludrocortisone**: Increases blood pressure, helpful for low BP contributors.
    - **Ephedrine**: Another option to raise blood pressure.
    - **SSRIs**: Sometimes used.
- **Consider Medication Interaction**: Review any medications that may contribute to syncopal episodes (e.g., antihypertensives).

## Management (Non-Pharmacological)

- **Lifestyle Adjustments**: Trigger avoidance and risk reduction are key.
  - Stay hydrated.
  - Maintain a high salt diet.
  - Use pressure stockings to prevent blood pooling in lower limbs.

Most individuals will experience isolated vasovagal syncope incidents related to specific triggers, generally requiring no specific treatment.
