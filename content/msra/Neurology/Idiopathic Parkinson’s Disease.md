### Overview of Parkinson’s Disease
- Chronic, slowly progressive neurodegenerative condition
- Caused by degeneration of dopamine-containing neurons in substantia nigra
- Results in dopamine deficiency, leading to movement disorders and motor symptoms 
- Symptoms become apparent after loss of at least 50% of dopaminergic activity
- Unknown aetiology; several genetic loci increase risk

### Diagnosis
- **Key Symptoms:**
  - **Bradykinesia:** Slowness in voluntary movement initiation; reduced speed and amplitude in repetitive actions
    - Accompanied by hypokinesia (poverty of movement)
      - Reduced facial expression
      - Difficulty with fine movements
      - Micrographia (cramped handwriting)
      - Shuffling gait
  - **Resting Tremor:** Typically a "pill-rolling" action of thumb and index finger; frequency 3-6Hz; improves with movement/mental concentration
  - **Rigidity:** Generally unilateral; includes cogwheel rigidity (stiff jerks during passive movement)
  - **Postural Instability:** Assessed with “pull test”; tendency to fall backward

- **Other Symptoms:**
  - Reduced sense of smell
  - Sleep disturbances
  - Autonomic dysfunction (e.g., constipation, excessive salivation)
  - Mental health conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, dementia, impulse control disorders)

### Investigations
- **Diagnosis:** Clinical based on history and neurological exam; rule out other causes:
  - Drug-induced parkinsonism (antipsychotics, anti-emetics)
  - Neurodegenerative syndromes (progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy)
- **Required Tests:**
  - Serum ceruloplasmin levels in patients <40 years to exclude Wilson’s disease
  - MRI brain if atypical features (e.g., gaze abnormalities, early dementia) present

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Medications:**
  - **Levodopa:** Primary medication; needs dopa decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa) to reduce nausea/vomiting
  - **MAO-B inhibitors:** (e.g., selegiline, rasagiline)
  - **Dopamine agonists:** (e.g., pramipexole, ropinirole)
  - **COMT inhibitors:** (e.g., entacapone) to prolong levodopa effect

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Deep Brain Stimulation:** Surgical option for advanced PD patients refractory to medication; electrodes are inserted into the subthalamic nucleus
- **Physiotherapy:** Improves functional performance and cognition
- **Speech and Language Therapy:** Addresses symptoms like hypophonia and dysphagia
- **Support and Counseling:** Essential for patients and families to maximize quality of life
