## Subarachnoid Haematomas (SAH)

- **Definition:** Intracranial hemorrhage due to bleeding in the subarachnoid space; distinct from intracerebral bleed.
- **Causes:** Can be spontaneous (e.g., Berry aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations) or traumatic.
- **Incidence:** Approximately 1 in 10,000 per year in the UK.

## Diagnosis

- **Symptoms:**
  - Thunderclap headache (sudden onset, described as the worst headache ever)
  - Associated nausea, vomiting, photophobia, visual disturbances
  - Commonly triggered by exertion or sexual activity.
  
- **Signs:**
  - Reduced Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
  - Meningism
  - Pyrexia
  - Signs of raised intracranial pressure (e.g., hypotension, bradycardia, papilloedema)
  - Severe cases: seizures, comas, sudden death.

- **Demographics:** Higher risk in women and older adults; many affected are under 50 years.

- **Urgent Investigation:** All headaches with red flag features warrant urgent evaluation.
  
- **Initial Diagnostics:**
  - **CT Scan:** Detects subarachnoid bleeding; sensitivity decreases over time (95% at day 1, 74% at day 3, 50% at day 7).
  - **Lumbar Puncture (LP):** Required for definitive diagnosis if CT is negative; key findings include blood in CSF, xanthochromia.

## Investigations

- **Key Tests:**
  - CT head and lumbar puncture
  - Routine blood tests (FBC, U&Es) to rule out other headaches (e.g., infections).
  - Coagulation screen and crossmatch.
  - ECG (ST elevation may indicate SAH).

## Emergency Management

- **Presentation:** Major SAH can show reduced GCS, seizures, or signs of raised intracranial pressure.
- **Approach:** Adopt ABCDE protocol, provide resuscitation, and discuss with neurosurgery.
- **Medication:**
  - **Nimodipine:** Administered to reduce vasospasm; monitor blood pressure.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Maintain cerebral perfusion with target ICP < 25 mmHg.
  - Maintain BP < 140 mmHg.
  - Monitor for complications (seizures, infection, hydrocephalus, re-bleeding).

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Supportive Care:**
  - Adequate analgesia (opioids as needed).
  - Antiemetics.
  - **Nimodipine** should be given for three weeks, titrated to systolic BP > 100 mmHg.
  - Hydration with normal saline.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Immediate Management:**
  - Bed rest and monitoring.
  - Acute head injury management may be necessary.
  
- **Specialist Consultation:**
  - Discuss with a neurosurgery center after stabilization.
  - Arrange angiography for potential aneurysms; first-line treatment = endovascular coiling.
  - Surgical removal for arteriovenous malformations.
  - Traumatic SAH usually managed supportively, with potential neuro-rehabilitation.
