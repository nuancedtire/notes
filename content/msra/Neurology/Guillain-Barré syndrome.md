### Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS)

- **Definition**: 
  - Acute inflammatory polyneuropathy often following an antecedent infection (up to 6 weeks before).
  - Characterized by ascending weakness of proximal muscles and areflexia.

- **Etiology**:
  - Considered an autoimmune disorder; infections may trigger it by producing antibodies that target myelin sheath or Schwann cells.
  - Common triggers: 
    - HIV
    - CMV
    - EBV
    - Hepatitis B or C
    - Zoster
    - Mycoplasma
    - *Campylobacter jejuni*
  - No identifiable cause in 40% of cases.

### Diagnosis

- **Symptoms**:
  - Ascending muscle weakness affecting lower limbs before upper limbs.
  - Progressive weakness for up to 4 weeks, followed by a plateau and then recovery.
  - Sensory function typically intact; autonomic changes possible (sweating, blood pressure changes, tachycardia, arrhythmias).
  - Common symptoms: back and leg pain, diplopia, facial weakness, ptosis, and bulbar palsy.

- **Differential Diagnosis**:
  - Bladder/bowel dysfunction suggests acute myelopathy rather than GBS.
  - More prevalent in men.

### Investigations

1. **Nerve conduction studies**:
   - Test at least 6 nerves (3 sensory and 3 motor).
   - Expect reduced conduction velocity and demyelination indications; 10% may initially be normal.

2. **Lumbar puncture**:
   - Classic finding: increased protein, normal cell counts.
   - High lymphocytes may indicate meningitis, sarcoidosis, HIV.

3. **Spirometry**:
   - Assess every 6 hours; ICU admission if forced vital capacity <20 ml/kg.
   - Preferred over pulse oximetry for faster decompensation detection.

4. **Liver Function Tests (LFTs)**:
   - Elevated AST/ALT during the first week indicates more severe disease; should normalise within 1-2 weeks.

5. **Blood and stool cultures**:
   - May identify triggers but limited clinical value.

6. **Spinal MRI**:
   - Considered if symptoms remain unclear despite alternative diagnoses.

### Management

- **Prescribing**:
  - Pain management: opiate analgesics, gabapentin.
  - Treatments: Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) or plasma exchange (IVIG has fewer side effects).

- **Non-prescribing**:
  - Importance of rehabilitation and physiotherapy to improve mobility, strength, and quality of life; reduces fatigue.
