**Alzheimer’s Disease Overview**

- **Type:** Neurodegenerative disorder
- **Impact:** Cognitive function decline, most common cause of dementia
- **Dementia Symptoms:** Chronic, progressive, irreversible decline in cognitive function.
  
**Cognitive Function Domains:**
- Memory
- Language
- Abstract thinking
- Motor skills
- Visuospatial skills
- Executive function
- Personality
- Social behavior

**Common Causes of Dementia:**
- Vascular dementia
- Lewy body dementia
- Frontotemporal dementia (Pick's disease)

**Prevalence:**
- Increases with age; majority over 65 years
- Early-onset occurs before age 65

**Pathophysiology:**
- Generalized cortical atrophy
- Affects temporal lobes significantly
- Key features:
  - Neurofibrillary tangles
  - Amyloid plaques (only visible post-mortem)

**Diagnosis:**
- Clinical diagnosis based on history of progressive impairment in at least two cognitive domains
- Tests (not definitive for diagnosis):
  - Abbreviated Mental Test
  - Mini-Mental State Examination
  - 6-item cognitive impairment test
  - Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination
- Key areas affected:
  - Short-term memory
  - Language (word-finding difficulties)
  - Visuospatial function
  - Praxis 
- Diagnosis often involves input from family members

**Investigations:**
- Blood tests to exclude organic causes:
  - Full blood count
  - U&Es, calcium profile, thyroid function tests
  - Haematinics 
  - ESR
- Screen for infection: 
  - Chest x-ray
  - Urine sample
- Imaging:
  - MRI to rule out hydrocephalus, assess for space-occupying lesions
  - Assess vascular dementia
  - MRI may show reduced hippocampal volume
  - PET/SPECT scans for perfusion/metabolic defects (not typically diagnostic)

**Management (Prescribing):**
- Medications:
  - Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine)
  - NMDA receptor antagonist (memantine)
- Monotherapy; switch drugs if no benefit
- Common side effects:
  - GI upset
  - Rashes (with rivastigmine patch)
  - Drowsiness, dizziness (with memantine)

**Management (Non-Prescribing):**
- Holistic, multi-disciplinary approach:
  - Involves neurologists, geriatricians, nurses, psychiatrists, social workers, occupational and physiotherapists
- Support for daily living activities increases with disease severity
- Potential need for full-time nursing care
- Occupational therapy interventions for safety and engagement (art and music therapy)
- Advance care planning is crucial; discussions should happen early before cognitive decline progresses
- Many have advanced directives and/or Lasting Power of Attorney
