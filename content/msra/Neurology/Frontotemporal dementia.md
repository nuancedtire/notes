Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a brain disease caused by degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. Key points include:

- **Genetics**
  - Strong family history linked to mutations in:
    - C9ORF72
    - MAPT (tau protein)
    - PGRN (progranulin protein)
  - 50% chance of inheritance for children and siblings if one parent carries a mutation.
  - Most with tau and PGRN mutations develop FTD; not all with C9ORF72 do.
  - Onset typically in mid-50s; prognosis is 3-21 years.

### Diagnosis
- Symptoms include:
  - Memory loss
  - Personality changes
  - Difficulty with language
  - Impulsivity and inappropriate behavior
  - Increased appetite and altered food preferences
  - Up to 50% may show Parkinsonism symptoms.
- Diagnosis through clinical history, examination, and brain imaging.

### Investigations
- Preferred imaging: MRI (shows atrophy of frontal/temporal lobes).
- Cognitive testing: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA).
- Rule out differential diagnoses:
  - FBC (anemia)
  - ESR and CRP (inflammatory conditions)
  - Free T4 and TSH (hyperthyroidism)
  - U&Es (renal failure)
  - LFTs (liver failure)
  - Serum B12 (megaloblastic/pernicious anemia)
  - HIV test
  - Serum folate
  - Syphilis serology

### Management 

#### Pharmacological
- **Medications for symptoms:**
  - Benzodiazepines for aggression/agitation
  - SSRIs for compulsions
  - Valproate semisodium for mood/impulsivity
  - Topiramate to suppress appetite
  - Antipsychotics for challenging behavior

#### Non-Pharmacological
- **Education:** for patients and caregivers on disease progression.
- **Legal Preparations:** introduce Lasting Power of Attorney for health and finance early.
- **Support:** recognize caregiver strain; offer psychological support and respite care as needed.
