Peripheral neuropathy develops from nerve damage in body extremities (e.g., hands, arms, feet). Symptoms may include:

- Symmetrical paraesthesia
- Numbness
- Dysaesthesia (abnormal unpleasant sensation upon touch)

Common cause: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), especially in individuals non-compliant with medication and lifestyle changes. Treating the underlying cause (e.g., T1DM) is crucial to prevent worsening.

### Diagnosis

**Diagnosis includes:**
- Patient history
- Neurological examination
- Clinical investigations

#### Neurological Exam Findings:

- Impairment in temperature, pinprick, vibratory sensation, and/or proprioception distally
- Reduced or absent distal reflexes
- Atrophy of intrinsic foot muscles with distal weakness

### Investigations

Laboratory testing guided by history, physical examination, and electrodiagnostic results includes:

- Full blood count
- Fasting glucose level
- Cholesterol testing
- ESR
- Thyroid stimulating hormone
- Vitamin B12
- Antinuclear antibodies
- Viral serology (HIV, hepatitis B, C)
- Syphilis and Lyme serology
- Nerve conduction studies
- Nerve biopsies (usually for rapidly progressive polyneuropathy)

### Management (Non-Prescribing)

Management is contingent on the underlying condition. For T1DM patients, it's essential to assess medication compliance and adequacy of dosage and frequency.
