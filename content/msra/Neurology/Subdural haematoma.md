## Subdural Haematomas (SDH)

- **Definition**: Intracranial hemorrhage caused by bleeding into the subdural space (between dura mater and arachnoid mater).
- **Cause**: Typically from tears in bridging veins and arteries, often due to head injury.
- **Mortality**: Acute SDHs have the highest mortality rate among traumatic brain injuries.

## Diagnosis

### Presentation
- **Acute SDH**: 
  - Symptoms: Loss of consciousness, reduced GCS, headache, seizures, vomiting, neurological deficits.
  - Onset: Slower than extradural and subarachnoid hematomas.
  
- **Chronic SDH**: 
  - Onset: 4-8 weeks post head injury.
  - Symptoms: Gradual headaches, cognitive decline, impaired consciousness, neurological deficits.
  - Risk group: More common in elderly, people with dementia, alcoholics.

### Key Considerations
- **Cerebral atrophy** is a risk factor.
- Important in “shaken baby syndrome” (alongside retinal hemorrhages and encephalopathy).

## Investigations

- **Initial Investigation**: Head CT scan;
  - Acute SDH: High-density crescent-shaped bleed on CT.
  - Chronic SDH: Decreased density, may require MRI for further characterization.
  
- **Additional Tests**:
  - Routine blood tests
  - Coagulation screen
  - Group and save/crossmatch for potential neurosurgery

## Management of Emergencies

- **Initial Management**: ABCDE approach for emergencies.
- **Resuscitation**: Necessary for severe head injuries, with urgent neuroconsultation.
- **Monitoring**: ITU setting for ventilation, vital signs, and intracranial pressure.

## Management (Prescribing)

- **Supportive Care**: 
  - Analgesia and anti-emetics.
  - For surgical candidates: Nil-by-mouth, IV fluids for hydration.

- **Chronic SDH Treatment**: 
  - Steroids (e.g., 2mg dexamethasone, three times a day) with proton pump inhibitor cover to reduce cerebral edema.

## Management (Non-Prescribing)

- **Surgical Interventions**:
  - Acute SDH: Emergency craniotomy for evacuation.
  - Discussion with neurosurgeon for all confirmed acute SDHs; transfer to a neurosurgery unit if needed.
  - Possible lobectomy for cerebral swelling.

- **Chronic SDH**: 
  - Requires urgent neurosurgical consultation for management decisions (conservative vs. surgical).
  - Surgical options: Burr-hole drainage, subdural drains.
  - Conservative care includes supportive treatment and steroids.

- **Post-Management Care**: 
  - Extensive neuro-rehabilitation may be needed depending on the severity of brain injury.
