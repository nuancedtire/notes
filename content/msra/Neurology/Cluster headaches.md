- **Prevalence:** ~1 in 1000; significant male preponderance; most common in 3rd and 4th decades of life.
  
- **Nature of Disorder:**
  - Chronic and debilitating.
  - Pain occurs in clusters: multiple episodes per day lasting 15 minutes to several hours.
  - Episodes can last from several days to a year, with remission lasting weeks or months.
  
- **Diagnosis:**
  - Primarily clinical based on history.
  - Characteristic features:
    - Severe unilateral pain (orbital, supraorbital, temporal).
    - Abrupt onset and resolution.
    - Pain described as "drilling."
    
  - Autonomic symptoms:
    - Excessive lacrimation
    - Nasal congestion/rhinorrhoea
    - Sweating
    - Miosis
    - Ptosis
  
  - Possible need for cranial imaging (CT/MRI) to exclude other causes.
  - Differentiation from migraines based on acute onset, short duration, and distinct patterns.
  - Normal neurological exam; deficits indicate alternative causes.

- **Investigations:**
  - Not necessary for diagnosis but may exclude other causes.
  - CT/MRI for suspected space-occupying lesions.
  - Routine blood tests (FBC, U&Es) for infection and baseline renal function.
  - Lumbar puncture for acute headaches with suspicion of meningitis or subarachnoid haemorrhage.

- **Management (Prescribing):**
  - **Abortive Treatments:**
    - Triptans (subcutaneous, intranasal, oral) for acute attacks.
    - Topical lidocaine as adjunctive treatment.
  
  - **Preventative Treatments:**
    - Prednisolone (short-term tapering).
    - Methysergide (limited long-term use due to fibrosis risk).
    - Ergotamine (1 hour prior to predictable attacksâ€”contraindicated with triptans).
    - Long-term: Verapamil (antiarrhythmic, ECG monitoring) and Lithium (serum monitoring, renal/liver tests).

- **Management (Non-Prescribing):**
  - Oxygen therapy: high-flow (7-12 L/min) for 20 minutes using a non-rebreather mask.
  - Trigger avoidance (alcohol, stress, GTN sprays, exercise).
  - Limited evidence for occipital nerve blocks and deep brain stimulation; considered experimental.
