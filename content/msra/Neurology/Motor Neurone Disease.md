## Motor Neurone Disease (MND)

### Overview
- **Definition**: Incurable neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurones.
- **Age Group**: Primarily affects individuals aged 60 to 80.
- **Types**: Majority are sporadic; some familial cases exist with genetic links.
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Painless progressive motor weakness 
  - Begins in limbs, axial, or bulbar muscles, spreading throughout the body.
  - Results in progressive disability and eventual death.
- **Survival**: Median survival ~30 months for the most common form; rarer subtypes may progress slower.

### Subtypes 
1. **Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)** - Most common.
2. **Progressive Bulbar Palsy** - Involves both upper and lower motor neurones.
3. **Progressive Muscular Atrophy** - Affects only lower motor neurones.
4. **Primary Lateral Sclerosis** - Isolated upper motor neurone disorder.
- **Overlap**: Subtypes may transition into one another.

### Diagnosis
- **Challenges**: Initial presentation is non-specific; often missed.
- **Steps**:
  - Comprehensive history and examination for motor neurone signs.
  - **Symptoms of Limb Involvement**:
    - Asymmetrical foot drop, loss of dexterity.
    - Upper motor neurone signs: weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign.
    - Lower motor neurone signs: fasciculations, muscle atrophy.
  - **Bulbar Features**: Dysarthria, sialorrhoea, dysphagia.
  - **Respiratory Symptoms**: Late feature; dyspnoea, orthopnoea, Type II respiratory failure.
  - **Cognitive Changes**: Behavioral issues, emotional lability, potential frontotemporal dementia.

### Investigations
- Diagnosis is clinical but requires investigations to rule out other conditions.
  - **Electromyography**: Measures nerve impulses in muscle groups; shows chronic degeneration.
  - **Nerve Conduction Studies**: Assesses impulse transmission rates.
  - **MRI Scan**: Normal in MND but helpful to exclude conditions like strokes, MS, Parkinson’s, or brain tumours.

### Management

#### Prescribing
- **No Cure**: Focus on symptom management and disease course modification.
- **Medications**:
  - **Riluzole**: A glutamate release antagonist; indicated at diagnosis to prolong survival.
  - **Spasticity Treatments**: Baclofen, dantrolene, gabapentin.

#### Non-Prescribing
- **Multi-disciplinary Team**: Includes neurologist, dietician, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech and language therapist; may also need social support.
- **Respiratory Management**: Non-invasive ventilation for patients with symptoms; tracheostomy and permanent ventilation for some.
- **Physiotherapy**: Aims to maintain joint range, prevent contractures, and reduce discomfort.
