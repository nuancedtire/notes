**Anterior Spinal Artery Syndrome Overview**
- **Cause:** Ischaemia of the anterior spinal artery, affecting the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord.
- **Effects:** Impacts the spinothalamic and corticospinal tracts, leading to:
  - Loss of pain and temperature sensation.
  - Loss of voluntary motor function.
  - Autonomic dysfunction (e.g., hypotension).
- **Etiologies:** [[Atherosclerosis]], thrombosis, aortic aneurysms, dissections, trauma.
- **Prognosis:** High mortality, poor long-term outcomes, often resulting in permanent disability.

**Diagnosis**
- **Symptoms:** Rapid onset (within 1 hour), acute back pain, motor paralysis below lesion, loss of pain/temperature sensation, autonomic dysfunction.
- **Preserved Sensations:** Light touch, vibration, and proprioception (dorsal columns unaffected).
- **Diagnostic Approach:**
  - History and neurological exam.
  - MRI scan is definitive but may not show abnormalities early on.
  - Differentiate from cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression via MRI.

**Investigations**
- **MRI Findings:** Characteristic hyperintensity of anterior horns on T2-weighted images (“owl-eyes sign”).
- **Other Tests:** 
  - Routine blood tests for infections/inflammatory diseases.
  - Advanced serology for conditions like Lyme disease, syphilis, HIV.
  - Lumbar puncture.

**Management (Prescribing)**
- **Treatment Approach:** Depends on the underlying cause; often leads to permanent disability.
- **Emergency Care:** Prompt intervention required.
- **Specific Treatments:**
  - Atherosclerotic/thrombo-embolic disease treated like acute ischaemic stroke.
  - Thrombolysis within 4.5 hours may be effective; antiplatelet therapy indicated.
  - Avoid antihypertensives; use IV fluids or vasopressors to support hypotensive patients.
  - Anticoagulation for short and long-term due to mobility decline.
  - Steroids may be given at presentation due to symptom overlap but with no definitive evidence for efficacy.

**Management (Non-Prescribing)**
- **Supportive Care:** Focus on preventing complications and managing morbidity.
- **Rehabilitation:** Long, intensive process involving a multi-disciplinary team.
- **Key Components:**
  - Mechanical prophylaxis to reduce thrombo-embolic risk.
  - Physiotherapy and occupational therapy for long-term rehabilitation.
  - Bladder management options for bladder dysfunction (catheterization methods).
  - Monitor and manage potential respiratory failure in cervical lesions; mechanical ventilation may be needed.
