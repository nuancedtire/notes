## Overview of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)

- **Definition**: Idiopathic, immune-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS with loss of axons in discrete areas (plaques).
- **Prevalence**: Leading cause of disability after trauma in young adults in the UK; peak incidence 20-40 years old.
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Female gender
  - Positive family history
  - Autoimmune disorders (especially HLA DQ6 variants)

## Triggers

- **Low Vitamin D**: Higher prevalence in northern/southern latitudes.
- **Infections**: EBV or HHV6.
- **Lifestyle**: Smoking.

## Pathophysiology

- T cells enter CNS, causing acute inflammatory demyelination (type IV hypersensitivity).
- Main characteristics:
  - Demyelination
  - Acute inflammation around demyelinated areas
  - Plaque formation from incomplete healing
- Result: Progressive neurological dysfunction from relapse and inflammation.

## Patterns of MS

1. **Relapsing and Remitting** (85%)
   - Attacks can last 1-2 months, followed by long remissions.
   - Gradual neurological deficit over time.

2. **Secondary Progressive** (50% of RRMS patients after 10-15 years)
   - Unremitting progression.

3. **Primary Progressive** (10%)
   - Progressive disability from onset, more common in males.

4. **Progressive Relapsing** (5-10%)
   - Progressive decline with occasional exacerbations.

## Diagnosis

- **Symptoms**: Recurrent neurological deficits.
- **Common Deficits**:
  - Optic neuritis (most common)
  - Motor cortex: hypertonia, hyperreflexia
  - Frontal lobe: cognitive issues
  - Parietal lobe: visuospatial problems
  - Temporal: poor memory
  - Brainstem: CN III dysfunction
- **Signs**:
  - Lhermitte’s sign
  - Uhthoff’s phenomenon
  - Non-specific symptoms: lethargy, mood disorder

## Investigations

- **Criteria**: At least 2 relapses + clinical evidence of 2 lesions or 1 lesion with previous relapse.
- **Tests**:
  - MRI: Identify white matter plaques (not definitive alone).
  - CSF analysis: Oligoclonal bands of IgG.
  - Visual evoked potentials: Measure axonal conduction.

## Management

### Prescribing

- **Acute Relapses**: 3-5 days of oral methylprednisolone.
- **Long-term Treatment**: 
  - Disease-modifying drugs (e.g., beta-interferon, natalizumab, fingolimod).
- **Symptom Control**:
  - Fatigue: Amantadine, modafinil.
  - Spasticity: Gabapentin, baclofen, botulinum toxin.
  - Bladder Dysfunction: Oxybutynin, botulinum injections, desmopressin.

### Non-Prescribing

- **Multidisciplinary Team**:
  - Neurologist
  - Physiotherapist
  - Speech and Language Therapist
  - Occupational Therapist
  - Psychologist
  - Family support
  - Specialist nurse
- **Non-Pharmacological**: Self-relaxation, mindfulness, CBT, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.

## Prognosis

- Life expectancy is typically 5-10 years less than average.
- Worse prognosis linked to male gender, older age at onset, progressive MS, and symptoms other than sensory/optic neuritis.
