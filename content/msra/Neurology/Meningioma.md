## Meningiomas Overview

- Common primary tumors in cranial and spinal compartments.
- Arise from meningothelial cells of the arachnoid mater.
- Three grades:
  - **Grade I:** Benign, slow-growing.
  - **Grade II:** Atypical.
  - **Grade III:** Malignant, fast-growing.
  
### **Symptoms**

- Often asymptomatic or discovered incidentally.
- Symptoms may develop only when the tumor is large:
  - Headaches
  - Seizures
  - Personality changes
  - Nausea and vomiting
  
#### Specific Symptoms by Location

- **Bone involvement:** Visible bony growth, proptosis (hyperostosis).
- **Suprasellar region:** Bitemporal hemianopia (lateral visual defect).
- **Olfactory groove:** Loss of smell (compression of the first cranial nerve).

### **Diagnosis**

- Neurological exam followed by imaging if symptoms present.
- Common imaging modalities:
  - **MRI:** Definitive diagnostic test.
  - **CT scan:** Alternative for those intolerant to MRI.
- **Biopsy:** Pathological analysis during surgery to determine tumor type (benign vs malignant).

### **Management**

#### **Prescribing**

- **Surgical resection:** Definitive treatment.
- **Corticosteroids (e.g., Dexamethasone):** Reduce symptoms by decreasing edema and pressure.

#### **Non-Prescribing**

- **Asymptomatic tumors:** Observation with annual MRI surveillance.
- **Symptomatic tumors:** Craniotomy and surgical resection; may include adjunctive stereotactic radiotherapy if complete resection isn't feasible.
