- **Definition**: TIA (Transient Ischemic Attack) is a transient episode of neurological dysfunction caused by focal brain ischaemia, lasting less than 24 hours.

- **Acute Management**:
  - Administer **300mg Aspirin PO** unless:
    - Patient has a bleeding disorder
    - Patient is on anticoagulant medication
    - Aspirin is otherwise contraindicated (seek specialist advice)
  
- **Referral Protocol**:
  - If suspected TIA within the last week, refer urgently to a specialist within **24 hours**.

- **Stroke Risk**: 
  - Significant risk of subsequent stroke post-TIA. 
  - TIA is a medical emergency; focus on secondary prevention and risk factor modification is crucial.

- **Driving Regulations (DVLA)**:
  - Patients must **stop driving for at least 1 month** after TIA or stroke.
  - Doctors must confirm no remaining neurological symptoms (especially visual or cognitive difficulties).
  - DVLA notification is not required post-TIA/full recovery, except for bus, coach, or lorry licenses.
  - If issues persist after 1 month, inform DVLA.
