### Tension Headache Overview
- **Commonality:** Most prevalent headache type.
- **Pathophysiology:** Poorly understood.

### Diagnosis
- **Method:** Clinical assessment; investigations primarily to rule out other causes.
- **Presentation:** 
  - Tight, band-like, diffuse headache.
  - Mild to moderate severity.
  - Duration: Hours to several days.
  - Functionality: Usually no daily activity interference.
- **Demographics:** Most common in teenagers and adults.
- **Types:**
  - **Episodic:** <15 days/month.

  - Tiredness.
  - Dehydration.

### Investigations
- **Routine:** Not necessary for diagnosis.
- **Red Flags:** Require further investigation if present:
  - Sudden onset.
  - Extreme severity (worst pain ever).
  - Accompanied by confusion, neck stiffness, photophobia, fever, nausea/vomiting.
  - Previous head trauma.
  - Neurological deficits (weakness, sensory disturbance, slurred speech).

### Management (Prescribing)
- **First-line Treatments:** 
  - Paracetamol.
  - Ibuprofen. 
- **Second-line:** Codeine (with caution due to risk of medication-overuse headaches).

  - Keep a headache diary (frequency, severity, triggers).
- **Lifestyle Changes:**
