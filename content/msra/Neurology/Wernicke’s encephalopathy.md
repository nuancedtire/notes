### Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE)

**Definition:**
- Clinical syndrome characterized by the triad of:
  - Acute confusional state
  - Ophthalmoplegia
  - Ataxia
- Caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency.
- Commonly seen in individuals with a history of alcohol excess.

**Pathophysiology:**
- Considered both a neurological and psychiatric disorder.
- Underlying pathology involves neuronal degeneration.
- Korsakoff’s syndrome is the progression from WE that leads to permanent cognitive impairment.

**Causes:**
- Alcohol excess (most common)
- Other causes:
  - Malnutrition
  - Anorexia nervosa
  - Hyperemesis gravidarum
  - Malabsorption (e.g., bowel resection)

### Diagnosis

- Based on clinical features - not all triad symptoms need to be present (only 10% of cases have all three).
- Most common symptom: confusion.
- Diagnosis often made in the context of established risk factors for thiamine deficiency.
- No global diagnostic criteria or utility of cranial imaging (CT/MRI) for diagnosis.

### Investigations

- Clinical diagnosis; investigations to rule out alternative causes include:
  - Basic blood tests (FBC, U&Es) for infection and electrolyte disturbances
  - Liver function tests (important for alcoholics)
  - Calcium levels (hypercalcaemia may cause confusion)
  - Urinalysis (including MSU) to rule out UTIs
  - Urinary drug screen for toxins
  - Cranial imaging (CT/MRI) if neurological causes suspected

### Management 

**Pharmacological:**
- Immediate thiamine replacement:
  - IV thiamine (brand name ‘Pabrinex’): 2 pairs three times a day for 3-7 days.
- Prophylactic oral thiamine for high-risk patients (alcohol excess/malnutrition) who are not inpatients.

**Non-Pharmacological:**
- Address underlying causes, primarily alcohol dependency:
  - Referral to alcohol support services
  - Support groups
  - Psychological intervention

**Long-term Considerations:**
- With treatment, confusion and ophthalmoplegia resolve in days; ataxia may become permanent.
- Affected individuals may require physiotherapy and occupational therapy.
- Development of Korsakoff’s syndrome may necessitate full-time care and support due to irreversible cognitive impairment.
