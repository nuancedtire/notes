- **Extradural Haematoma (EDH) Overview**
  - Commonly arises from trauma in the temporoparietal skull region.
  - Blood collection between dura mater and skull.
  - Most often caused by rupture of the middle meningeal artery; can also involve the middle meningeal vein or dural sinuses.
  - Rarely caused by ruptured arteriovenous malformations.
  - Complications may include infection, cognitive impairment, epilepsy, hemiparesis, or brainstem injury.

- **Diagnosis**
  - Characteristic lucid interval post-trauma (few hours to days).
  - Possible initial loss of consciousness or confusion.
  - Symptoms due to increased intracranial pressure: severe headache, confusion, vomiting, hemiparesis, seizures, coma, and death.
  - Physical signs: brisk reflexes, positive Babinski's sign, fixed/dilated pupil on affected side.
  - Risk of brainstem herniation if intracranial pressure continues to rise.
  - **Note:** Lumbar puncture is contraindicated in raised intracranial pressure.

- **Investigations**
  - A-E assessment for consciousness and airway management in head injury patients with reduced GCS.
  - Urgent non-contrast CT head needed; EDH presents as ‘lemon-shaped,’ while subdural haematoma appears ‘banana-shaped.’
  - Angiography may be used if arteriovenous malformation is suspected without trauma history.
  - Skull x-ray can check for fracture, but CT is more sensitive.

- **Emergency Management Related to EDH**
  - Urgent referral for neurosurgery to decompress and evacuate haematoma.
  - Better prognosis with rapid surgery; poor prognosis associated with low GCS on arrival, fixed dilated pupil, or decerebrate posturing.

- **Medical Management**
  - Drugs to decrease intracranial pressure: mannitol and barbiturates.
  - Prophylactic antibiotics for open skull fractures (to prevent meningitis).
  - Anticonvulsants for patients experiencing seizures.

- **Non-Prescribing Management**
  - Initial A-E approach essential; includes C-spine immobilization, oxygen administration, intubation, and ventilation if required.
  - Urgent neurosurgery referral for decompression, clot evacuation, and to stop bleeding.
  - Surgical access usually via burr hole, or craniectomy if needed.
