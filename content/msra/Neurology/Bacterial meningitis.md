### Bacterial Meningitis Overview
- **Definition**: Life-threatening emergency requiring prompt recognition and intervention.
- **Characteristic Triad**: Headache, neck stiffness, photophobia; often accompanied by fever.
- **Immediate Treatment**: Antibiotics should be administered without delay upon clinical suspicion.

### Common Causative Agents
- _Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus)_
- _Streptococcus pneumoniae (streptococcus)_
- _Haemophilus influenza_ types B and C
- Group B streptococcus (most common in neonates)

### High-Risk Groups
- Infants and adolescents
- Immunosuppressed patients
- Patients with penetrating skull trauma or fractures
- Neurosurgical patients

### Diagnosis
- **Immediate Action**: Start treatment on clinical suspicion before confirmatory tests.
- **Symptoms**: May include seizures (20-30%), cranial nerve palsies, and focal neurological deficits.
- **Key Signs**: Brudzinski’s and Kernig’s sign can indicate meningitis but may not always be present.
- **Confirmatory Test**: Lumbar puncture and CSF analysis, following initiation of treatment.

### Investigations
- **Routine Blood Tests**: Assess infection, inflammation, electrolyte disturbances, and coagulation profile.
- **Blood Cultures**: Identify causative organism and assist in antibiotic tailoring.
- **CT Scan**: Required if raised intracranial pressure is suspected before lumbar puncture, which is contraindicated under certain conditions.

#### CSF Findings for Meningitis
| Aetiology        | CSF Pressure | White Cell Count                         | Protein Level | Glucose Level |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Bacterial        | High         | Very high, predominantly neutrophils    | High          | Low           |
| Tuberculosis      | High         | High (neutrophils early, lymphocytes late) | High         | Low           |
| Fungal           | High         | High, predominantly lymphocytes         | High          | Low           |
| Viral            | Normal/High  | High, predominantly lymphocytes         | Low           | Normal        |

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Initial Treatment**: Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given immediately.
- **Antibiotic Choices**:
  - Meningococcal rash: IV benzylpenicillin or ceftriaxone.
  - No rash: IV cefotaxime or ceftriaxone.
  - Over 50 years: Add IV ampicillin for _Listeria monocytogenes_ coverage.
  - Infants <3 months: IV cefotaxime with ampicillin or amoxicillin.
  - Pre-hospital: IM benzylpenicillin if delay expected.
- **Seizure Management**: IV lorazepam; persistent seizures treated as status epilepticus.
- **Specific Treatments**: Dexamethasone may improve survival in _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ meningitis.

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Raised Intracranial Pressure**: May require urgent ITU transfer, mannitol, sedation, intubation, and ventilation.
- **Notifiable Disease**: Report to public health authorities; close contacts given prophylactic antibiotics (ciprofloxacin or rifampicin) and possible vaccination.
  
### Vaccination Programs
- Routine vaccines against:
  - Meningococcal groups B and C
  - _Haemophilus influenza_ group B
- Meningococcal ACWY for adolescents and university starters.
- _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ vaccine introduced January 2020.
