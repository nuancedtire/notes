## Multi-Infarct Dementia (Vascular Dementia)

- **Definition**: Chronic progressive brain disease causing cognitive impairment. Second most common dementia type after Alzheimer's.
- **Causes**: Reduced blood supply due to:
  - Infarcts
  - Subcortical leukoencephalopathy
  - Hemorrhage
- **Risk Factors**:
  - Diabetes mellitus
  - [[Atherosclerosis]]
  - Hypertension

### Diagnosis

- **Criteria for Diagnosis**:
  - Dementia + Evidence of cerebrovascular disease
  - Dementia symptoms include:
    - Impaired memory
    - At least two of the following:
      - Orientation
      - Attention
      - Language
      - Visuospatial functions
      - Executive functions
- **Common Presentations**:
  - Dysphasia (expressive/receptive)
  - Impaired problem solving
  - Unawareness of time/place
  - Difficulty learning new information
  - Challenges in daily living activities
  - Behavioral/psychological symptoms (psychosis, agitation, depression)

- **Cerebrovascular Disease Evidence**:
  - History, neurological examination (focal signs like hemiparesis, visual field defects, facial weakness), brain imaging.

- **Specific Features for Probable Vascular Dementia**:
  - Sudden symptom onset
  - Stepwise cognitive deficits progression
  - Early gait dysfunction/unsteadiness
  - Early urinary incontinence
  - Cognitive symptoms onset within three months post-stroke

### Investigations

- **Primary Diagnosis**: Clinical based on history and neurological exam.
- **Routine Lab Tests**: 
  - Full Blood Count (FBC) (anemia)
  - Vitamin B12 (deficiency)
  - Thyroid Function Tests (TFTs) (hypothyroidism)
  - Electrolytes (hyponatremia)

- **Imaging**: 
  - CT or MRI to detect infarcts, leukoencephalopathy, hemorrhages.
  - Required to confirm diagnosis.

### Management

#### Prescribing
- **No Cure**: Focus on preventing further atherosclerotic disease.
- **Medications**:
  - Antiplatelets (Aspirin, Clopidogrel)
  - Anti-hypertensives (Ramipril)
  - Statins
  - Optimize glycemic control in diabetic patients.
  - If Alzheimer's is present, consider cholinesterase inhibitors (Donepezil) or NMDA antagonists (Memantine).

#### Non-Prescribing
- **Cognitive Interventions**: 
  - Structured group cognitive stimulation
  - Reminiscence therapy
  - Use of familiar objects or life histories

- **Carotid Artery Stenosis**: >70% stenosis may require:
  - Carotid endarterectomy
  - Angioplasty and stenting
