## Amaurosis Fugax

### Overview
- **Definition**: Temporary painless loss of vision in one or both eyes.
- **Causes**: Emboli, vasculitides, inflammatory eye conditions, optic neuritis, space-occupying lesions.
- **Common Origin**: Carotid or coronary vessels; relates to transient ischaemic attack (TIA).
- **Symptoms**: Described as “a curtain being pulled down,” lasts typically 5-15 minutes. Can involve quadrantanopia or full anopia based on affected ophthalmic artery branch.

### Diagnosis
- **Clinical Diagnosis**: Based on characteristic presentation.
- **Examinations**:
  - Neurological: Visual field assessment to check for neurological symptoms.
  - Ophthalmological: Advanced imaging and examination by specialists.
- **Medical History**: Comprehensive history and examination are necessary.

### Investigations
1. **Initial Imaging**: 
   - CT Head: Assess for ischaemic/haemorrhagic events or space-occupying lesions.
2. **Laboratory Tests**:
   - Basic blood tests (FBC, U&Es).
   - Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR): Elevated in giant cell arteritis.
   - Lipid panel and blood glucose: Assess for atherosclerotic disease.
3. **Further Imaging**: 
   - MRI: If CT is normal, to identify subtle infarcts.
   - Carotid Doppler: Evaluate for emboli/[[atherosclerosis]].

### Management (Prescribing)
- **Based on Underlying Cause**:
  - **Embolic**: 
    - 2 weeks of high-dose aspirin.
    - Long-term antiplatelet therapy.
    - Secondary prevention with statins and anti-hypertensives.
    - Manage concurrent risk factors (e.g., diabetes).
  - **Inflammatory Conditions**: 
    - Steroids for giant cell arteritis (high dose for 12-18 months).

### Management (Non-Prescribing)
- **Carotid Endarterectomy**: Indicated for risk reduction if carotid emboli are the cause; assess stenosis (50-70% moderate stenosis may warrant intervention).
- **Lifestyle Modifications**:
  - Healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, alcohol reduction.
  - Address other medical risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease).
- **Driving**: Advise against driving for one month post-symptoms; notify DVLA if residual impairment occurs.
- **Support for Visual Deficits**: Occupational therapy, registration for visual impairment eligibility.
