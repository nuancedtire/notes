### Benign Positional Paroxysmal Vertigo (BPPV)

**Definition:**
- Disorder of the inner ear causing brief episodes of vertigo triggered by head position changes.
- Commonly described as “the room spinning” or dizziness.

**Causes:**
- Loose otoliths (calcified particles) in semicircular canals disrupt the vestibular system.
- Exact cause often unknown; may occur after head injury, viral infections, or Meniere’s disease.

**Symptoms:**
- Vertigo following movements (e.g., turning in bed, lying down, sitting up, looking up, bending forward).
- Associated with nausea; episodes last seconds to minutes.
- No neurological deficits, but nystagmus may be present.

### Diagnosis

**Clinical Presentation:**
- Characteristic vertigo following specific head movements.

**Diagnostic Test:**
- **Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre:**
  - Patient lies supine; head is extended 30 degrees.
  - Positive if vertigo is reproduced and nystagmus appears.
  - Test done with both ears facing down.

### Investigations

- No specific imaging needed for diagnosis.
- MRI head if:
  - Diagnosis is uncertain.
  - Neurological features present.
  - Condition unresponsive to treatment.
- Investigate for secondary causes (e.g., infection, head injury) if suspected.

### Management

#### Prescribing:
- Most cases resolve spontaneously; corrective manoeuvres effective in 80-90%.
- Chronic cases may require:
  - Antihistamines (e.g., cyclizine).
  - Histamine analogue (e.g., betahistine).
  - Anticholinergics (e.g., hyoscine butylbromide).
- Medications for acute exacerbations; limited evidence for long-term use.

#### Non-Prescribing:
- Corrective manoeuvres for persistent episodes:
  - **Epley manoeuvre:** Extension of Dix-Hallpike; head rotation before sitting up.
  - **Semont’s manoeuvre:** Lying on side that induces vertigo, then switching sides until symptoms subside.
  - **Brandt-Daroff exercises**: Self-administered exercises during exacerbation.

- Surgical option: 
  - **Semicircular canal occlusion** for severe cases unresponsive to other treatments.
