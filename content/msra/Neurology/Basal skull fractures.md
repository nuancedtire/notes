- **Definition**: Basal skull fracture refers to a fracture at the base of the skull involving ethmoid, sphenoid, occipital, frontal, and temporal bones.

- **Causes**: Trauma from:
  - Road traffic accidents
  - Sports injuries 
  - Assaults

- **Demographics**: Most common in younger individuals engaged in high-risk activities.

- **Prognosis**: 
  - Most fractures heal conservatively with few complications.
  - Possible complications include:
    - Intracranial injury
    - CSF leaks 
    - Meningitis 
    - Cranial nerve palsies 

## **Diagnosis**
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Headache
  - Nausea
  - Reduced consciousness 
- **Cranial Nerve Damage**: 
  - Oculomotor, trochlear, abducens, facial, vestibulocochlear nerve damage
  - Symptoms: Ophthalmoplegia, facial droops, hearing deficits 

- **Clinical Signs**:
  - *“Racoon eyes” sign*: Bilateral eye bruising
  - *Battle’s sign*: Bruising of mastoid process
  - *Otorrhagia*: Ear bleeding
  - *CSF otorrhoea*: CSF leakage from the ear
  - *CSF rhinorrhoea*: CSF leakage from the nose

## **Investigations**
- **Imaging**: 
  - CT scan is the investigation of choice.
  - MRI and plain X-rays are less useful.
- **CSF Leak Diagnosis**: 
  - Test fluid from the nose/ears for beta-transferrin.

## **Management (Prescribing)**
- **General Approach**: 
  - Supportive treatment (analgesia, antiemetics).
  - Monitoring for neurological deterioration, especially in patients on anticoagulants.
  
- **Antibiotics**: 
  - No evidence supporting prophylactic antibiotics to prevent meningitis.

## **Management (Non-prescribing)**
- **Management Types**:
  - **Conservative**: Most non-displaced fractures; requires monitoring.
  - **Surgical Intervention**: Indicated for:
    - Displaced fractures
    - Intracranial bleeding
    - Blood vessel injury
    - Cranial nerve injuries
    - Persistent CSF leaks

- **Surgical Options**: 
  - Decompression and CSF leak repair. 

- **Feeding Methods**: 
  - Nasogastric tubes contraindicated; use orogastric tubes if feeding necessary.

## **Trauma Assessment**: 
- Initial assessment focusing on airway, breathing, circulation, and spinal stabilization is essential for all traumatic head injuries.
