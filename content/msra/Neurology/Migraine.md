**Migraine Stages:**
1. Prodrome
2. Aura

4. Postdrome

**Key Points:**
- About 70% of migraines do not have aura
- **Prodrome (up to 2 days before headache):**
  - Symptoms: excessive yawning, mood changes, neck stiffness, appetite changes
- **Aura:**
  - Fully reversible focal neurological symptoms (visual, sensory, speech)

- **Postdromal Symptoms:**
  - Fatigue and mood changes may last up to 48 hours post-headache

### Investigations

- Clinical diagnosis based on history/examination
- Required investigations for red flags:
  - New onset after age 50
  - Change in headache pattern
  - Systemic disorder symptoms (fever/weight loss)
  - Persistence after Valsalva/exertion

**Tests:**
- Serum ESR: for scalp tenderness/jaw claudication (temporal arteritis)
- Lumbar puncture: for thunderclap headache/systemic features (exclude subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis)
- CT Brain: for acute headache evaluation (suspected intracranial hemorrhage)

### Management (Prescribing)

- **Mild-Moderate Migraine:**
  - Oral NSAIDs (aspirin, diclofenac, ibuprofen) or paracetamol
- **Severe Pain:**
  - Oral triptans (sumatriptan, eletriptan) or combination therapy
  - Anti-emetics (metoclopramide) for nausea/vomiting
- **Frequent Recurrent Attacks:**
  - Prophylaxis: propranolol or amitriptyline
